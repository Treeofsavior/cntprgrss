Philipas' Soldier
The monsters' attacks are becoming more violent. {nl} I'm determined to succeed, but I also fear for our safety.
It doesn't matter - I can give up my life today, or be a dead man tomorrow.
Commander Vacenin
Somehow, we need to resolve our poor supplies and forces. {nl}Once we accomplish that we will be able to break through the forest, piece by piece.
Even though everyone's getting tired, we can't give up until Kateen Forest is ours again.
Senior Officer Philipas
I wish for a peaceful world. {nl}In order for this to happen, I need to work harder.
I'll do anything to regain this forest from the monsters. {nl} It's worth risking my life for.
Our front line is composed exclusively of Philipas' troops. {nl} They'll follow Philipas' commands through anything.
Live with the idea that any moment could become your last. {nl} We must learn from the past and use it to our advantage.
Officer Felix
The Entrance of Kateen Forest is rather on the safe side, but please refrain from going any deeper than this.
Weak Owl Sculpture
My power is slowly weakening. {nl} Even though there are many souls that need guidance...
Scared Owl Sculpture
The holy power of the forest is weakening. {nl} What will happen to us after it's gone?!
It's too scary. {nl}This never happened when the goddess was still around...
Sincere Owl Sculpture
This forest is cursed... it consumes the owls. {nl} I have hardly anything to compel bravery from others.
Ever since that huge tree suddenly arose, this forest has changed into something horrid. {nl} Even the trees' roots frighten whoever stares at them.
Devoted Owl Sculpture
Someone was held captive. {nl} I have a feeling he's going to disappear...
The sacred force created by the goddess has not completely disappeared. {nl}Will it be able to suppress this devastation? {nl}
The chief gave me power.{nl}I won't be scared.
I'm not going to be afraid anymore. I will never be eaten by monsters.
Troubled Owl Sculpture
I'm suffering every day.{nl}Perhaps, I will also be eaten by monsters.
This forest is increasingly covered with demons.{nl}Where is the goddess?
I was chosen by the chief... {nl} I'll do my best to defeat the monsters.
The chief is also struggling like this...{nl}Never will I be eaten until the goddess comes back.
Subordinate Owl 3
We have always been here at this place, but where is the goddess who has always looked after us?
Do we exist only for guiding humans' souls?
Soldier Dominic
I've been ordered to protect this place with my life and to do some reconnaissance at the same time.{nl}I don't know exactly what they expect me to do.
Next time I'm going to make sure they tell me exactly what they want me to do.{nl}No. wouldn't it be better to ask Julian?
If it's just monsters of that level, I guess I can report that there is no serious problem.{nl}Oh, if you happen to run into Samson, please tell him to stop fooling around and continue scouting.
I will protect this area, so go patrol Veltui Crossroads.{nl}As for the reports, I will do them separately at a later time.
Soldier Samson
Can you please help me find Dominic's engagement ring? {nl} I'm currently undertaking a mission, so I won't be able to leave this spot.
I tell you, he acts like that even though I bought him a roughly similar one. So stingy...
What is this ugly thing? Oh, could the ring be inside?
A knife won't fit inside, and there's no other way to get it out.{nl}Right! Can't we burn it to retrieve what's inside?
Just make sure to bring me ones that aren't too thick.
This should be just right.{nl}Good. Now, how do I burn this while I am working and not get caught?
There should be plenty of Dry Thorn Forest Wood at the edge of Ishisineti Cliff. {nl} I'm on patrol and don't have time, so I ask of you again.
Ah, you should be able to burn it secretly at the top of Ishisineti Cliff. {nl} This is my last request. You just need to make preparations for the fire.
I will never again care for another's wedding ceremony.
I'll just say I have to go to the bathroom and burn it secretly there.{nl}Thank you very much.
Soldier Poulter
My goodness, the order states to eliminate all of the monsters in this area!{nl}How am I supposed to handle this many enemies all by myself?
It was too overwhelming to carry out the task just by myself.{nl}However, I'm really fortunate since you decided to help me.
I could almost cry my eyes out!{nl}Thank you very much for your help.
Commander Julian
Thanks for the help! {nl} If it's okay with you, I'd like to borrow some more of your strength.{nl}
Won't you support Commander O'Rourke's unit at the Veltui Crossroads?
Commander O'Rourke
Very impressive.{nl}Looks like I'll have to buy Julian a drink.
It occurred to me while watching Ironbaum. {nl} What an exceptional companion it could be.
O'Rourke's unit has been exhausted through big and small battles with Ironbaum.{nl}It would be very reassuring if you could become our strength.
Substitute Owl Sculpture
I want to help purify the thorny forest, but I'm not strong enough. Could you eliminate the Tree Ghouls bothering the soldiers?
It would be nice if more people could come and go using this road like before.{nl}I find people very interesting.
Thank you. I hope I'm not giving you needless trouble all because of my aspirations.
Alright. We haven't received any word from our forces at Niurus Highway.{nl}I request you find them.
If you can't find them, return to us.
Soldier Kallus
There are still a few of our colleagues further in.{nl}Please help us.
Soldier Dainus
Ironbaum attacked us at the Drieza Waterland.{nl}There are still soldiers left that have not yet escaped.{nl}
I'm embarrassed to have escaped by myself.{nl}
Settled Owl Sculpture
I have something to ask from you.{nl}I'm worried about the soldiers who are being hurt by the Ravinelarvae.
Thank you.{nl}From now on, can our soldiers work comfortably?
I appreciate your kind help.{nl}One day, I will return this favor when I meet your soul form.
Are you the famous Revelator?{nl}Good, I'm puzzled with something. I need your help.
Ah, now I've received the order.{nl}Return to Commander Julian.
I'm collecting information about Ironbaum.{nl}In order to reach the Gateway of the Great King, we have to defeat this monster first.
Thank you.{nl}Come back after taking this order to Poulter at Zaizda Hill.
Give me back the good old times.{nl} When there were no thorns.
If the path to the Gateway of the Great King is safe then I will be able to see more people.{nl}
Over all this time, I've seen it all.{nl}Now, I want only joy to be seen.
Why do human souls contain so many things?
If we run into monsters, we'll have no choice but to fight.
We're working to reach the Gateway of the Great King.{nl}Have you heard the news about Ironbaum?
In order to be a group leader, you need unwavering principles.
It's true that trying to reach the Gateway of the Great King is reckless.{nl}However, we can't disobey the order.
It may seem bad at first, but the two commanders have a surprisingly good relationship.
I feel so lonely since no one is here.{nl}It's been a long time since I met new faces.
What do you want to do here in this empty forest? No way, the way is available?
Thank you.{nl}The soldiers and my colleagues will now be able to sleep comfortably.
I can't feel my arms and legs.{nl}I feel so strange even though It's not cold.
We must defeat Gaigalas.{nl}Otherwise, I won't be able to sleep in peace.
We will start the hunt for Gaigalas soon.{nl}I'm so excited.
This grudge is so sad.{nl}It's sad that we are powerless to stop it either.
Losses will continue unless somebody stops the demons.
Joint Investigation Unit Member Frey
I'm Frey.{nl}Listening to the story, the situation sounds bad.{nl}If the information you and Scott researched is correct.
{nl}Then, I will have to do something.{nl}Please defeat some Red Vubbes first. They have been bothering me lately.
Please, I ask of you...{nl}I get sick just looking at the red color.
Oh, did you really defeat them for me?{nl}Thank you!
I got something after talking with Scott.{nl}Something like a moving Woodsman piece of tree sculpture.{nl}Is it somehow related with the bark of a tree that the Vubbes got?
By the way, there is still no news from Scott about a second report.{nl}I wonder what happened to him? Hmm...
Wow, great!{nl}I owe you one. Thank you!
Right? So I will ask you.{nl}Woodsmen are appearing on the Deer Hoot Site along with the left side of the path.
I will take this combined result of the information Scott gave me and this fragment to my superior. {nl}By the way, There is still no news from Scott. Even the time Scott promised has long since passed. Just using the hearsay is not enough for the other investigator?{nl}
Could you pick up the report from Scott?{nl}Do not forget to scold him for skipping work!
Please handle Scott's report. Okay?{nl}Sometimes, he is stupid, but he is also cute.
I have no face. Nowadays, I have been investigating everywhere to find something..{nl}Thanks a lot. If you are not..{nl}Ah, I don't want to think about it.{nl}
Oops, there's no time for this.{nl}I'm sorry, Please give it to Frey instead of me.{nl}I don't know where to start to clean the mess that Vubbes did..
Ah, it is the report! {nl}Good, and what was Scott doing?{nl}
Really? He couldn't handle a single Vubbe and got in trouble instead.{nl}Such a shame..I will scold him later!
Everything is messy. {nl}I can not concentrate as the Vubbes.{nl}He must laugh, If he look at it?
Joint Investigation Unit Member Frey
It is still in progress to find the truth of the events.{nl}Take it. It's a soul collection scroll.{nl}
Once you defeat the Red Vubbe using this scroll, the soul of Vubbe should be out?{nl}I'll have you collect it for me. Then, the data are almost done.
Do not forget the order.{nl}You have to defeat the Red Vubbes after using the soul collection scroll on them. Alright?
About the bark of a tree that the Vubbe got.{nl}I think I can combine it using something like a spirit..{nl}Well, Please tell this news to Ukirt.
Joint Investigation Unit Member Ukirt
Scott and Frey did a good job. What do you think of it?{nl}I don't think so that Vubbe can't create themself.{nl}I will have to check what they do using this.{nl}
There may be something inside the supply boxes that the soldiers left a long time ago.{nl}You will find some old supply boxes up there.{nl}Can you go there and check? If we obtain some clues there, we may get an answer.
If you go back the way you just came, you will see an observatory tower on the hills.{nl}I hope the monsters haven't touch it yet..
Are they really planning something?{nl}Something.. is suspicious..
The Vubbes broke the supply boxes and ran away with this?{nl}Why? Were they really making it?{nl}No way, they aren't smart enough to do that.{nl}
Good! We should pay attention and solve the problem!
Okay. Are you ready?{nl}
Before you came, I saw Vubbes moving in groups.{nl}Go to Gebene Cliffs and see how the situation is.
The Vubbes were always involved with anything that happened here.{nl}It can't be just a coincidence..
I think.. I understand now. {nl}I think that was like a big factory creating huge monsters called Woodspirits.{nl}
The flag of Vubbes must have called in the ghosts.{nl}Then they polluted the trees and created huge monsters.{nl}
That tree barks must have been the ingredients for making Woodspirits.{nl}There's no way those Vubbes could do it alone.{nl}They must have received an order from somebody!
We may find some decisive evidence at the place where the Vubbes are grouped together.{nl}If Prey sees this, it will like it!
Vubbes are not very smart so he must have made only simple orders.{nl}How could he think about controlling those Vubbes..{nl}I don't know what to say. {nl}
I am sure that Woodspirits are created from various places.{nl}I can sense vicious energies coming. {nl}We should first destroy the flags that are creating Woodspirits!
Leave as soon as you are ready. {nl}The best course of action for now is to stop the creation of Woodspirits..
I think we've done our best for now. {nl}Since we can't do anything about the ones that were already created.
I can feel the closest flag from here is near Gatves Highway.{nl}The huge trees that people saw is probably Woodspirits.{nl}How could I miss this simple thing.
Earnest Owl Chief Sculpture
Thank you so much. {nl}The other owls must have gained confidence because of you.
Weak Owl Sculpture
It really was too late..{nl}The goddess really can be harsh sometimes..
I have one last request. {nl}Can you burn the Owls so they could rest in peace?
Do you think my allies can reach Goddess Ausrine safely?
Thank you so much. {nl}First bring me the Oil from Oil Boxes on the way to Neuoder Field.
If you are okay with it, I'd like to get some more help from you.{nl}I've sent a messenger, but due to the last attack, I am now worried about him.{nl}
That messenger should be safe... but I still worry for him.
Thank you so much.{nl}He must be there by now.
The squad was dispatched to recover Kateen Forest from the monsters.{nl}The entrance here to Kateen Forest is safe compared to other areas. The other areas are yet to be recovered.{nl}
As you go deeper inside, there are a number of soldiers along the way lacking in supplies.{nl}If a well known person like you can help them, it will be a great help.{nl}
Fallen Messenger
This is my fault, for assuming the entrance to Kateen Forest was secure.{nl}I will go back to the camp after taking a short rest.
Ah, this is my bag.. thank you for saving me.{nl}
Only you can help me right now.{nl}Can you tell Felix that the operation at Peledos Crossroads has already started?{nl}{nl}
There are many strange things that can't be seen in forests other than Kateen Forest.{nl}Such as the wooden owl sculptures.
The operation? Oh, what an ignorant messenger.{nl}I can get that from the camp... Thanks anyway.{nl}
Oh, the way back is dark, so it would be appreciated if you could light up the bonfire again.
You can't see much sunlight in Kateen Forest due to the enormous amount of trees.{nl}It seems like ghosts could come out at any moment.
Okay, so the messenger is safe?{nl}This place has been well taken care of thanks to your efforts.
I shall take some rest here.{nl}Is there a good place to hide?
For letting Saltistter come in this far behind our lines, I should scold the person in charge of guarding this place.{nl}Thanks anyways. You sure live up to your reputation.{nl}
Guard Lyle
I lost many colleagues through the Petrifying Frost.{nl}I don't understand why I am here to support a newbie Chronomancer... so inefficient.{nl}On top of that, we don't know when those violent monsters would attack here.
If you are okay, can you get rid of the monsters while we are protecting here?
It is very unfortunate that we should take care of that woman this time.
Thanks. We can stay safe here for some time.
 A few weeks ago, our comrades were attacked while sleeping by Petrifying Frost.{nl}After the world turned out like this, we haven't gotten much support and have to wait here.{nl}The monsters are attaking the petrified victims at the moment. May the curse lay upon those monsters!
If there are comrades out there who still remain in stones, can you stay near them and protect them for a while?
My old friend, Galen is one of the victims.{nl}Please protect him.
Thank you so much. I hope the reinforcement comes soon so he could return to his family even if he is petrified.
There are many cursed documents and uncleaned objects on Ruklys Street.{nl}There are also many thieves who are after those.{nl}And among them, Dico Thieves frequently attack the guards.
Can you defeat them at the military district?{nl}If you could defeat them, we will go and capture them.
The one who was caught last time told us that the stone statues were talking to him.{nl}Do you think that makes sense?
I was able to arrest lots of thieves because of your help.{nl}Thank you.
Guard Nomabis
A few days ago, we lost our supplies to Dico Thieves.{nl}They must have taken them to Drasos Chapel Ruins, but since I can't leave this place, I guess we're all gonna die.
Can you retrieve the lost supplies?
A few decades ago, the thieves attacked the guard camp and stole the supplies secretly.
They lured us in front of them and stole the objects from behind so there was no way we could prevent them from stealing.{nl}They wanted to take the objects legally so they were sent to gallows.
The number of Dico Thieves is growing.{nl}They are very close to monsters. I don't know if they train those monsters or if there is something that I don't know yet.{nl}I heard the Knights of Kaliss was attacked by them.{nl}Maybe they are going after Sabina. She carries only expensive stuff.
To avoid any kind of danger, we should first attack before they move.{nl}Go to Drasos Chapel Ruins and defeat them.
The city that collapsed hundreds of years ago does not have any assets or lives to protect.{nl}It rather feels like protecting ruins. There are thieves as well.
You taught them a lesson. Well done.
A few weeks ago, the colleagues who used to work here received damage by Petrifying Frost and became stone statues at the square. {nl}The reason why the colleagues received damage was because they were engaged in eliminating traps that the thieves had set, but could not avoid them.{nl}There are still many traps around. We recently found one of them. Can you get rid of it?
The number of Dico Thieves may be more than the number of guards.
You caught monsters outside the thieves' area. I am sorry that you had to go through such a dangerous job.
Chronomancer Sabina
Lots of things happened here, but since they occurred long time ago, we need more information in order to find out the truth.{nl}Can you find the records from the Gate Route that was fallen down and make copies of them?
Everything is being destroyed as time passes by.
Thank you. This is about the collapse of the fortress.{nl}I should look more into it to find more decisive information.
I am doing many investigations here, but I am having a hard time discovering an incident that occurred more in the past due to those monsters.{nl}Can you go and look into the past on behalf of me?
Use the magnifying glass of time near Pergale Highway. You should be able to see the past.
Please use it with extreme care. This is the only one left.
What the hell happened? Do not say anything about what you've seen here outside.
To understand better about the circumstances, we have no way but to go to the Fortress of the Land which is the headquarter of Ruklys.{nl}But, we can't enter since the Royal Army guards are limiting the entrance.{nl}I have a good solution though..
The portal that was used by the remnants when they tried to run away from the Fortress of the Land.{nl}There are total ten of them according to the record.{nl}Four of them are here. Can you check if they are still activated?
Because of our plan, we may be sent to the gallows.{nl}Please keep it a secret.
The portal at the military district is our only hope.
Hunter Talus
I am looking for a few artifacts of Lydia Schaffen, who built the Astral Tower.{nl}The famous archer who planted an arrow into Ruklys' chest.
Royal Army Guard Retia
Because of the Petrifying Frost that were created due to Ruklys' rebellion a few hundreds years ago, the land turned into a wasteland.
We will allow you to enter since the Knights of Kaliss requested us to do so, but please stay where our gaze remains.
After Medzio Diena four years ago, Benas was appointed as the chief commander for the forces here.{nl}He ordered to take good care of the road leading to the Fortress of the Land.
If you are not in a hurry, please defeat the monsters in area A.{nl}That will be the first step for you to contribute to the goddess and the kingdom..{nl}Of course, I will promise you enough rewards.
Rebel Commander Ruklys, and the citizens here engaged in an evil conduct{nl}despite the selections from the great merchant, Premier Eminent. The result is this place.
That's not bad. Maybe the guards can use it.
After Medzio Diena, the Petrifying Frost are occurring irregularly.{nl}Due to irregular Petrifying Frost, we lost many of our soldiers on this wasteland.{nl}And we set the petrification devices limitedly here at the square of lamentation and we check the frequency of the frosts and move out the soldiers accordingly.
Check the petrification devices if you want to to loyal to the Kingdom and receive it's determination.
There are monsters who try to go after the soldiers who maintain the devices. Be careful.
The Petrifying Frost are to be driven away from the two places.{nl}I heard you are a quite famous Revelator. {nl}Aren't you?
Starting from a few months ago, the monsters who attacked the soldiers who maintain the devices have appeared.{nl}The soldiers who were able to survive told us that it was a gigantic bird.{nl}When we looked at the illustruated records of the Kingdom, it looked a lot like a Sparnashorn.
If you are the Revelator, you will have no problem fighting against it.{nl}But, not here in area A. The exhausted soldiers may get involved in it.
Use this absorption scroll to temporarily get rid of the Petrifying Frost that're starting to form in area A. {nl}The Sparnashorn will then appear from the Petrifying Frost in area B.
These guards had their lives threatened by the Sparnashorn and Petrifying Frost. {nl}They are blinded by fear so they don't stand a chance fighting against it.
The Petrifying Frost is gone, but only temporarily.{nl}There is no way we can stop the punishments Ruklys will bring no matter what we do.
Are you ready? It's time to defeat the Sparnashorn. {nl}But we don't have enough time. No matter how great a Revelator you are, if you are exposed to the Petrifying Frost, then that will be the end. {nl}Go to area B. The Sparnashorn will come attacking if you touch the detector. {nl}Defeat it and get out of there before the Petrifying Frost starts.
Running to evade it is also a good way. {nl}But you can't keep doing that for long. {nl}This has to be stopped when there's a great and loyal volunteer like you.
Hearing that it was defeated is the most hopeful story I've heard in years. {nl}Now I better let the troops rest first and tell them the good news.
There is something I always wanted to ask if I'd meet anyone here. {nl}Can you clean our workshop? Monsters pop out wherever I go and I can't work. {nl}The cowards of the Royal Army are too scared to even come near here so don't mind them. {nl}What do you think? Can you help me?
The kind of work I do is business secret so I can't tell you what it is... {nl}No one owns these things anyway. Finders keepers if you need it.
That fast? Have you not missed any of them?
Aren't you curious how I made it through the strict security? {nl}It's all becuase I have connections. There are some Royal Army guards who buy xxx claws to raise their work records. {nl}But actually, I don't want to be around those monsters. Especially with A's.
Can you catch them and get me those claws?
I think you misunderstood. We are archeologists, not thieves.
This seems quite pricey. {nl}Thank you very much.
You better stop if you're planning to get something from the Petrified City. {nl}Aside from us, there is the outrageous Dico Thieves. {nl}But you might be at least rewarded if you help us out.
In area A, there is a box that contains things the Dico Thieves bring in from outside. Can you get them? {nl}I took a sneak peek and seems like they are not back yet.
They are really clever. {nl}They bring in cheap antiques and place them where the Petrifying Frost blows. {nl}Then the antiques would petrify and turn into something that looks exquisite. {nl}I heard the nobles in big cities are fooled and buy them at expensive prices.
Seems like the Dico Thieves are planning to make their business bigger than I thought. {nl}That's an enormous amount. Do you think they also have connections with the Royal Army?
Petrified flowers are sold at very high prices among novice sculptors. {nl}They look at this to make counterfeits but they don't know where it is from. {nl}It wouldn't do any good to know anyway...
So, can you collect some petrified flowers?
My brother once studied hard to become a sculptor. {nl}Although I don't know where he is after Medzio Diena... {nl}I'm sure he's carving a beautiful Goddess Statue somewhere if he is alive...
This reminds me of my brother... {nl}Where and what would he be doing now? {nl}Anyway, thank you for collecting it.
I have a friend who's supposed to come here but he's nowhere to be found. You didn't think I'd work alone in this huge area, did you? {nl}I think something happened.
He is hiding among the guards in Security Area. This Water Bottle has a code on it. If you give it to the guards, he'll know and talk to you.
Better work on it quickly because the Petrifying Frost just sweeped by. {nl}You can know when and where the Petrifying Frost starts if you observe the Royal Army's retreat. {nl}And the fastest way to get that information is by becoming a Royal Army guard.
Hush! Lower your voice. It will be the end of both of us if we get caught.
Did that stupid Hubertas send you here? {nl}I told him many times that I'd go back if I'm done with my work here. {nl}I didn't know his stupidity would send someone. {nl}There is a big problem here actually.
Our family can't come into the city from outside. {nl}We need your help. {nl}We can't bring in my family without the troops knowing. {nl}They should all be gone from here.
I'm going to make a big fuss in area A. I'm going to call in Saltistter that are roaming around the area. {nl}In order to do this, you need to gather Scented Stone Powder from the monsters. Can you do it?
Our families should have passed this place earlier than the Royal Army. {nl}But Retia hurried things when the Petrifying Frost swept by some time ago so we weren't able to.
This is exactly right. {nl}If you pour this here, you will soon see the Saltistter show up it's huge self. {nl}But that is not our plan!
We should not make this place a battlefield. Then our families can't pass through. {nl}Let's think for a while...
Apply this powder on x monster that appear in area B. {nl}Then the bewitched Saltistter will attack them. {nl}Retia will not just stand and watch her area be invaded like that.
Our families come from various areas. I was also once a junior officer with dreams to become a strategist. {nl}Of course, it was before the area I was assigned to completely disappeared from the map 4 years ago on Medzio Diena.
Did you use everything? {nl}Then now it's time to get busy!
Go to Retia and tell her that Saltistter is coming. {nl}She won't believe it but I can already feel the Saltistter running at us. {nl}Hurry!
You just have to tell her that Saltistter is coming. {nl}There is no reason for her to suspect us.
Our families passed through this place thanks to you. {nl}You will find many interesting truths if you continue your journey in this area. {nl}And you may also meet our families. But be careful of the Dico Thieves. {nl}Unlike us, they were robbers from the beginning.
Guard Gofden
I don't want to be here either. There's really no need to guard this place. {nl}Orders came in to support the Knights of Kaliss.
Can you help me? {nl}Kostas has not come back for days so I can't leave this place but the monsters are running wild so I can't just stay put.
The officers don't like the Knights of Kaliss. {nl}As for lower rank guards like me, Knights of Kaliss give us supplies and support so there's no reason for us to hate them.
When I first came here, we just had to be careful of the Petrifying Frost but since Medzio Diena four years ago, every day is a crisis. {nl}I'm going to apply to move out when I'm done here.
It hasn't been that long for the Royal Army to enter this area by the request of Kostas. {nl}Much of the city remained in it's original form 600 years after the misfortune. {nl}One of my missions here is to clear the records of rebels remaining here.
I can't leave my post since Kostas is not here. Can you take care of it for me? {nl}You can find many records if you look around the trade area and Parduo square area.
Don't mind what's written on the records. {nl}It's all nonsense.
I have to escort, clean up, and guard. I wonder how they are expecting me to do everything alone. {nl}It's a good thing you came to help.
A few days before I was dispatched here, many soldiers came to this place to do a preliminary check for the research of Knights of Kaliss. {nl}But no one returned. They were attacked by the irregular Petrifying Frost.
I was ordered to take back their keepsakes but it's hard just to think about it. {nl}Can you help me out?
The authorities do not take it well that tens of soldiers were sacrificed for support activities. {nl}That's why the Royal Army and the Knights of Kaliss have become distant.
You may not believe it but I might have been standing there too. {nl}Good thing I was off duty that day.. I don't even want to think about it. {nl}I will deliver this to the families of the deceased.
How are you traveler, although, I don't know why you are passing through this place...
Ah, so you are the famous Revelator. I've heard a lot about you from my colleagues in Klaipeda. {nl}They say you go around to save the world according to the will of the goddess?
Then let me make a good offer, I found a way to turn back this Petrified City. Can you help me? {nl}First, get rid of the monsters around here. I have to be safe first before I can tell you anything, right?
The Cryomancers in Klaipeda are stubborn and arrogant. If you feel something like that from me, then that's your delusion. {nl}There is Cryomancer as humane and warm-hearted as me.
Did you dry the seeds? Good, anyway.
Now, the next test is for you to take this and test if it's usable while I find the formula of magic circle. {nl}An Ice wall will appear if you use this so check how useful that is to the monsters. {nl}We need a safety net in order to test and this will do the job.
The monsters will come attacking when the Ice wall is formed so take care of the rest of the monsters that you missed a while ago.
The Petrifying Frost will not happen anymore for a while. {nl}Don't worry about that.
It's very effective! Now this should be able to block monsters or Revelators.
Now we get to the important part. The most important part of the test is to find the Mark of Silk, a strong magic tool that can turn back petrified things. {nl}The stupid Royal Army lost the last Mark in this area 4 years ago so it's probably somewhere around here. {nl}It can also be inside the monster's stomach.
Defeat the monsters and get the shiny stone from them. That will shine by itself so bring that and I will look for it.
The stupid Royal Army probably doesn't know how great that Mark is. {nl}Probably no one knows, except me.
Pray that the Mark of Silk is among these stones. {nl}If not, I will be really mad.
Aha! It's here. Why wasn't the Royal Army able to find it when it is so easy like this? {nl}Are their heads only good for wearing helmets? Anyway, let's begin the test. Follow me to the magic circle I installed.
Hey friend, how did you get here? {nl}Are you looking for a job? {nl}I might sound a bit nosy but It's dangerous to go around alone. {nl}Of course, the same goes for anyone else too.
I need to work in the commercial area but I can't work alone because of the monsters. {nl}Can you help me out?
It's a good thing the cowardly Dico Thieves did not come until here. {nl}Things are limited but people are coming in flocks to take it away...
If it's cleared up that much, then looks like I can start already.
I'm gonna go to Gerove Workshop. Can you help me out while I work? {nl}You jsut have to follow me around and fight the monsters while I do the work.
I got a load of it thanks to you. I won't have to go around for days. {nl}I plan to wait here until my colleagues arrive.
Please take care of the monsters and grave robbers in the Barracks District while I prepare the test. {nl}We should not be caught or interrupted.
It's relatively safe on top of the fortress. There are monsters and thieves swarming if you leave this place.
You cleared the test areas. Good job.
I will proceed the test from up here. {nl}Please go to the portal and prepare to test it.
Everything will be alright. It's all just visuals and it can't come across to this world.
Something outrageous happened. What could those be? {nl}Chronomancers will not believe it. Did the past interfere with the future? Or the future interfere with the past?
I better stay here and tune the portal leading to Final Battle Field.
Adjutant General Hans
It hasn't been long since we cooperated with the grave robbers. {nl}Supporting them without the Royal Army knowing is like having your life on the line. {nl}But what can we do. We're just following orders. .
They will pass through the Downtown Street. {nl}Of course, they will face the monsters. A big commotion will happen and the guards will find them. {nl}I want you to get your hands on at that point. Unlike the Dico Thieves, they can't stand to be in debt so they will be helpful to your journey.
They are more than just a few so we don't know when they will pass through. {nl}But we continuously watch over so that nothing will go wrong.
Did you defeat the monsters? The guards were asking what the fuss is about so I told them about you. {nl}Everything should be alright.
Don't forget. Our helping the grave robbers here is a secret to the Royal Army. {nl}Your life can be on the line.
We need to bring Stepnas to Downtown Street. {nl}He promised to get us the Frost Core which will help in studying the Petrifying Frost. {nl}We need to slip away the guards in order to do that.
The guards are unofficially receiving supples from the knights. Please coat it with the monster's scent. {nl}Then give it to the guards at the mouth of the river. This will cause a big commotion.
They will reduce their boundaries as they are getting attacked. {nl}Or bring a huge army in. {nl}But they won't be able to do that with the current state the kingdom is in.
Did the guards sense the scent? {nl}The monsters should have.
The Stone Whale will soon attack the guards. {nl}Act like you're greeting them and lead them to vacate the crossroads. {nl}Then Stephonas will pass through without secretly.
Rofdel will be watching from the watchtower but on a foggy day like this, he won't take action.
Stephonas passed through safely. {nl}He was looking for you. Go and help him. {nl}The guards won't mention our names to Rofdel. {nl}What they have been taking until now was all against the military law.
The headquarters are collecting old records that the Royal Army weren't able to clean up. {nl}Since you've seen it a few times yourself, did you sense something fishy?
The Royal Army spreading promotional materials praising the great prime minister of the past, Premier Eminent, and the grave robbers. {nl}Please get that leaflet. There will be a loophole if we compare it with the historical data we've collected.
The Royal Army have had difficulty recruiting since 4 years ago so they've been spreading out leaflets like this to the nomads outside the fallen city or the grave robbers for them to apply. {nl}Of course, they will just be treated like slaves when the world becomes better to live.
So, this is what it says. They made such embarassing stories sound like a heroic epic to the ignorant people. {nl}I will send this to the headquarters.
You're the one who made me an opportunity. {nl}You deserve applause for understanding and executing Hans' imprudent plans, but we have to stay quiet so just receive my thanks.
The reason I called you is to find the Frost Core that I've promised Kaliss knights. {nl}But I didn't know the guards are goind around like that! There's a change of plan.
The Frost Core that we're looking for is inside Stone Froster. You will need a very strong bomb to get it out. {nl}Bring me the stone gun powder from the monsters nearby watermill ruins. Then I will process it to be useful.
There is someone watching the Downtown Street from the Southern Watchtower. {nl}It won't be easy to make him ignore the fuss you and I made here. {nl}So just do as I tell you.
Ah, this will make a great explosion even with a small hit. Good! Wait a minute.
To prevent this from exploding in your hands, you either have to make it a time bomb, or throw it. {nl}But you can't really find fuse around here and it wont light because of the dust. {nl}I will give you the processed stone gunpowder so throw it to the monsters. If you're lucky, it will create a big explosion without any noise and if not, it will make them angry.
If we can't get this done, we can't even start with the next step.
It won't explode right away and explosion is not steady. What to do...
In order to make it stick to the monster! and then explode with a BAM! then we need something with high viscosity. {nl}Can you get Sticky Liquid from the monsters in Viskas?
I'll say it again but this is the only way to keep you safe.
I think you spilled some on your way. Too bad for your new shoes.
You will find a stiff Stone Froster in the residential area. {nl}It fumes somethings like the Petrifying Frost but it is not that dangerous. {nl}Throw this to it to wake it up.
Remember to stay away after you stick it on to it!
Maybe this time, it can even be seen from Fedimian.
So this is the frost core that bothered many people... {nl}The soldiers who helped you will tell the guy watching from the watchtower about your heroic stories so they won't suspect you. {nl}Dont' worry.
The watchtower is starting to breakdown. Support has been cut for years and there is no place like here to watch over this area. {nl}We can't send the troops to Fedimian so we have to be self-sufficient.
While you're her, can yuou get rid of the monsters near Vadovo Dock and get lump of lime from them?
I can't find workers so the new recruits are operating and restoring elevators.
Thank you. {nl}We better start restoring when the next Petrifying Frost is over.
There are limes that constantly float down the Vadovo Dock. {nl}It is the record of the disaster 600 years ago. {nl}They depress the morale of the soldiers so the officers retrieve or destroy them. {nl}But we can't do that anymore so I want you to bring them to me.
Reading stuff about the death throes of rebels gives us the chills.
Got to break this one and use it to restore the watchtower. It's killing two birds with one stone.
The monsters that weren't able to run away from the Petrifying Frost are gathered in the demolished Amosi Port below the watchtower. {nl}Problem is that it's causing other monsters to gather. {nl}Some even act as though it's petrified and deceive the guards.
Can you take care of them?
In the past, this place was a big city that's not even comparable to Klaipeda or Fedimian.{nl}But when people left, monsters started to fill the place. {nl}From then, the monsters adjusted to the city in ways even smarter than humans.
You know better about what the Royal Army should do than the army themselves. {nl}Do you have any thoughts on applying to the Royal Army? I'm just kidding.
We lose a few soldiers whenever the Petrifying Frost sweeps by. {nl}The kingdom can't support for the lost soldiers so the number of our men to guard the area is decreasing. {nl}So we thought of an idea to train the refugees and grave robbers to become guards.
What we can do here is to post this leaflet around Downtown Street. {nl}Can you do it?
I'm sure people are taking the leaflets but the number of applicants have decreased recently. {nl}It's either the grave robbers started checking inside or the monsters think of it as food and are eating it. {nl}Isn't it suspicious?
Thank you. If you serve the kingdom like Premier Eminent, I'm sure you will take an important role when the kingdom flourishes.
Wilhelmina Carriot
There is nothing more useless and stupid here than helping the Royal Army. {nl}If you want to help someone, I ask your favor to help us out instead.
The number of monsters in Kovos Hall Site is increasing. {nl}We don't even know what is leading them here. {nl}Please get rid of them.
I heard you have a lot of battle experience. {nl}There are even stories about you saving towns and villages. I look forward to seeing the great things those people saw.
You're as great as the rumors say. The Knights of Kaliss need heroes like you.
Stone debris and dust blow a lot in this area so many soldiers and knights cough severely. {nl}The headquarters send us refreshing candies mixed with medicinal herbs. {nl}But our soldiers were swepted by the Petrifying Frost while carrying our supplies for this month and the monsters stole it all.
Can you get defeat those monsters and get back the refreshing candies?
I would like to give you some if we have extras. {nl}Even the grave robbers are preying on the candies.
I won't blame you if you eat one secretly. {nl}But you don't seem to be that kind of a person.
Soldiers patrolling this area were swept by Petrifying Frost while passing by Stalactite square some time ago. {nl}We are only affiliated to Royal Army but we're mostly residents of Kaliss province. {nl}I want to help my folks from back home.
But there is no way to get them out of the curse. {nl}We can only get their last will and keepsakes for their families. {nl}Won't you show your kindness for them?
I understand their loyalty for the kingdom but when I see them make people do impossible things that result to deaths, I don't know who is the monster anymore.
Nonsense! {nl}You mean all of them are gone? {nl}I'm sorry to have made you face such misfortune.
In order to restore the city, the Knights of Kaliss are recruiting more men than their budget could handle. {nl}I was also recently hired to release the curse through spell. {nl}But they just recruit people without any support afterwards.
If my presumptions are correct, there is a high possibility that all of the things happening here are results of someone's sinister spell. {nl}In order to check, we need elixirs to drag out whoever it is. {nl}Can you defeat the monsters in Sacred port and get those?
New methods always lead to new directions. {nl}I will lift this curse.
That's enough ingredients to make the Liberation Elixir. {nl}Now, let's start.
I will give you this Liberation Elixir. {nl}Use it on petrified guards or grave robbers. {nl}Their souls trapped in their body might tell you something about what they last witnessed.
The angry souls might attack you.
There was nothing worth noting save for the victims being overwhelmed with fear before their deaths.{nl}I guess I better look for even older victims.
Before they die, petrified victims release evil thoughts.{nl}Please use the incense and the stone while the knights are gone and I'll be heading over. When enough of the evil thoughts have gathered, we can see what happened on that day.
Please do not provoke them. You know how those guys get.
This is some serious stuff. I should deliver it to the headquarters of the knights.
It's not like paper or trees, it's a living thing that turned to stone and died...{nl}Where else would such astonishing things happen? I am very interested in this strange phenomenon.{nl}With your assistance, I might be able to help those who are still alive, with minimal injury.{nl}Well, they may lose a few fingers.
Can you try using this solvent on the monster? There must be some of them suffering from the stone curse.{nl}If we can use it on them, shouldn't it work on humans too?
What do you think? Even if it works on just one or two of them, that would still be great.
You weren't able to save any of them? {nl}I guess this is not a good way. I will take back what is left.
I think we should use different drugs and test as much as we can. {nl}But then we will need a lot of samples.
Can you defeat the monsters in Neiveikiama Castle and get me petrified samples?
I'm still thinking so can you come back later?
This should be enough for about five tests. Good work.
May those sacrificed rest in peace. However, like the river that attracts those who are thirsty, this place is astounding for me and my thirst for knowledge. {nl}But there is a foolish monster trying ruin this wonderful place. Can you take care of it?
It if has a brain, how can it go around ruining this? {nl}Oh well, maybe that's why it's a monster.
Did you defeat it? Great job!{nl}Now I don't have to fear this place being torn down until another monster shows up.
I heard about you from Wilhelmina. I heard you're good? But can you enter the Fortress of the Land without our help? {nl}You will need a pathfinder no matter how good you are. I will take you if you help me and Wilhelmina.
Wilhelmina asked for the records from Ruklys days in exchange for her help. Can you gather it from the assembly area in front? {nl}I will cause a big commotion if we go out ourselves so I want you to do it.
We plan to go into the room of treasures in the Fortress of the Land without the Royal Army's knowledge. {nl}But there's a Gargoyle blocking our way and we can't defeat it ourselves without making a fuss. {nl}That's why we need your and Wilhemina's help.
Did you see the Gargoyle statue in the assembly area? It moves whenever I try to approach it so I can't get into Fortress of the Land.{nl}Wilhelmina says she has a tool to suppress it so you just have to hand over what you found and take that from her.
Unlike other knights, Wilhelmina seems to have sensed something. {nl}We work in hand in gloves so it's been easier for use to do work around since Wilhelmina came here.
Now hand over these records to Wilhelmina and take that thing we need.
Finally, the records untouched by the Royal Army have arrived. {nl}This is... a love letter? I don't need it so you can take it or throw it away.
Hmm... It contains most of what we need. I better send this to the headquarters. {nl}I will give you this vacuum scroll. Use this on the Gargoyle that bullies Amanda. {nl}No sound will transmit even if you have an explosion or thunder inside so the Royal Army will have no clue.
The Knights of Kaliss have some very good wizards so they will give us what we need.
It looks more pleasant than I expected. I thought she'd give us something like a ballista or a cannon. {nl}But I guess this would be the best for us?
Can you use that on the Gargoyle while I pack? {nl}I'm sure it will be easy enough for you.
There is a monocle that helps you identify precious things and it will help us find the room of treasures easily.
The scroll Wilhelmina gave us is awesome!{nl}I didn't hear a thing even from here.
Shall we go now?
I'm a wizard who can't use any magic. I feel pathetic.
Antares... He used to be a great wizard back in the day.
Rearguard Unit Soldier
We, the Rearguard Unit, are in charge of controlling and guarding the lines of communication and supply.
We need to regain the forest captured by the monsters. {nl}We will not fall back this time!
If we retreat, Klaipeda will be totally isolated.{nl}
Troops in the frontlines don't know what hardships we go through. {nl}They think that they're the only ones who have their lives on the line.
It would be nice if the goddess send us her blessings at times like this... {nl}Honestly, we're exhausted.
Do you think there will be an end to this war? {nl}Frankly, I'm scared.
The Rearguard Units are doing their best, but the supply situation remains horrible.
Is Helgasercle attacking again? {nl}If that's the case, this battle will be a very long one...
Are there still a lot of monsters in the tower?
Even if they outnumber us, we can't let them ruin the tower!
Suspicious Lamp
I may just be an unusual lamp, or not.
Recently monsters have been swarming out of the deep parts of the forest. {nl}But our chronic shortage of manpower is hindering us from taking action. {nl}
After much debate on how to solve the situation, your name was brought up. {nl}They said you would gladly come forward to hunt down the monsters. {nl}
I don't know how to thank you for accepting such a difficult mission.. {nl}Well then, please take care of the monsters in Purple Tree Fault Forest. {nl}Purple Tree Fault Forest is located past Fedimian, on the way to the Cathedral.
Good job. {nl}I've been hearing a lot about how great you are, but it seems like it wasn't all just rumors.
Huh, tsk tsk... What a pity. {nl}Of course, a merchant like me won't fully understand it.. {nl}
But if you help me out, I will give you something. It may not be as great as what you broke but it's pretty good.
It's nothing much, really. {nl}The symbol of pilgrim on the Starving Demon's Way outside Fedimian will do.
Nevermind if you can't. {nl}But if you can, that'd be awesome.
Oh, you got it... {nl}Well, aren't reckless challenges the fun in life?
The monsters are eating my companions. {nl}I still have some holy power from the goddess, but it won't last long.
Officer Danus
Many cities will become isolated if we don't get back this forest.. {nl}But the situation isn't on our side.
This forest doesn't even have Owl Sculptures. {nl}Makes you feel like you really don't want to come back.
Soldier Roy
I heard the Rearguard Unit was surrounded. How did you make it through? {nl}
Squad Commander Johan
I am a squad commander who sent his men first. What words can I say? {nl}I feel miserable.
This battle was a shameful one as a commander. {nl}I don't know what would have happened if it wasn't for you..
Danus' Scout
It's too scary to patrol the area full of monsters. {nl}But I can't keep relying on other people either..
Ruklys and I were taught by the same teacher.{nl}That's why I know what he is trying to achieve.
Lands with buried stories also tend to have lots of resentment. It can't be any better for studying necromancy.
Epitaph of Agailla Flurry
My name is Agailla Flurry. {nl}I have realized something from the epitaphs left in the land and I would like to make a confession.
Since some time ago, I was able to have a long life through a strong spell. {nl}As soon as I realized that I was not bound by the lifetime of humans, I lived the life of a bystander.
(You cannot read the rest because the epitaph is damaged.)
Only after a century of achieving nothing did I start to regret the life I lived. {nl}And after spending a long time lamenting on my foolishness, I decided to follow their mission.
I cannot reveal what this mission is. {nl}And I do not know how I will continue it.
Maybe my tower soaring towards Goddess Gabija can continue the answer. {nl}But I will not be like my predecessors, letting my personal feelings ruin the work.
How foolish it is to be overconfident and be swayed by shallow feelings. {nl}You, who lives through such times, must have realized something like I did.
To finish, I thank you for making pilgrimage following my epitaph. {nl}I will leave you a little bit of power on this epitaph as a reward.
Villager
This place is over. {nl}With so many monsters, I can't be a lumberjack here anymore.
Old Man Moses
Why isn't Cahill here yet? Tsk tsk..
Villager Cahill
I don't get why the old man is like that to me.
I think I can understand him now. {nl}But it would be much better if he treated me kindly.
A bow once made can fire many times, but arrows are gone once shot away. {nl}That's why we never stop making them.
I don't think prayers and ceremonies are the only way to serve the goddess. {nl}Serving the world through physical training is also an important mission of the cleric. {nl}That is what a monk is.
I'm sick of Fedimian. {nl}Where could my brother be..
For what did my brother... {nl}How important could that thing be...
Fedimian is still under reconstruction. {nl}The Holy Area is better off; the other areas are so bad you can't even enter them.
I'll probably be working again from now on. {nl}You gotta be busy to feel alive.
I would have been in trouble if not for your help. {nl}Fedimian is still under construction and there aren't any proper medical facilities.
There are two ways to approach the goddess. {nl}Strong belief for the goddess and the sound of silver dropping on the offering box. {nl}We're just being honest here. Don't you think the same?
I don't really mind the rumors but do people believe that spell can retain your youth? {nl}Well, maybe it can but... {nl}Ah, I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Supplies Officer
There's always a shortage of supplies and we're always tired.
The Rearguard Unit always complains the supplies are late or inadequate. {nl}But we have our own problems.
Oh, you got them. Thank you. {nl}Please go back to the monster's nest and burn the Destroyed Owls.
Terrible things are happening. {nl}Can't we just go back to the peaceful days?
The goddess can be so cruel. {nl}Please pray that my colleagues may rest in peace.
Pilgrim Liliya
If I die, please bury me..{nl}Make my body unseen...{nl}If I lose my breath, please bury me...
And if you meet a pilgrim named Julius, please tell him these words... tell him goodbye...
Pilgrim's Memo
This land is cursed by Naktis. {nl}I may die but let it be known to the pilgrims who pass this place. {nl}Demon Lord Naktis drove cursed Tree Root Crystals around this Ray-lit Land, and those Tree Root Crystals are spreading curse of indolence to the pilgrims.
You must destroy the Tree Root Crystals to avoid the curse. {nl}May the goddess' blessings be with the pilgrims.
Who? {nl}
Anyway, do you have any food? Please give me something to eat... I can't stand the hunger anymore. I can't move. Hey, if you have faith in the goddess, please get me some food.
Even the meat of those wild monsters is fine. Eating the whole world is not enough... Ugh... I'm hungry.
Not yet? I think I can even eat you now.
Aakk! That's right!! Give me that! I will eat it all!
Hey don't go yet! Not yet!{nl}
I ate meat so I need to eat veggies. {nl}I heard the shoots of the reeds around here are moist and edible. {nl}Get it! I'm hungry! I want to eat!
Look through the reed shoots!
Why are we told to share with others when I don't even have enough food for me? {nl}Is it hypocrisy?
Pilgrim Julius
I think there was some food here... {nl}Did that guy take it? {nl}Ugh..
I'm starving and now I'm having headaches! {nl}I feel my head exploding with just the thought of food but other things keep coming to mind. {nl}What was it... Something like an orgel...
{nl}Why does it's food keep popping up in my mind when I can't even eat it.
Those dirty fools... I will revenge... {nl}Aah Liliya...
The necklace.. yes. {nl}Well done.. Please take good care of it. {nl}This is a token of my gratitude.. The orgel was a memento for both of us but the necklace is special...
{nl}The Cathedral was blessed so I'm sure it'll be a good thing for you too.
Aaaaagghh! Aaagh! {nl}I will swallow it all!!!
Who are you? Ugh... I want to keep arguing but I'm starving.. {nl}
...Hehe. What do you say helping me eat if you have time?
Maybe even some monster flesh... Arrg I'm too hungry and seeing things again!
Monster meat has some odor but it's not too bad to eat. {nl}
Hehe. Thank you. {nl}As you can see, I just can't move.
That is it! give me that! {nl}I'm going to eat that! No one can take it from me! It's mine!
...? That? What about that? {nl}
Oww! My head! Arrgh! Yuck! What's that? What about that orgel? {nl}
My memories... Her... Give me that! It's mine!
So that's what happened... Thank you. She left this orgel behind. {nl}We promised marriage and we left our way on pilgrimage to the Cathedral to confirm our promise for the future. {nl}But ah.. Liliya.. Liliya..!!{nl}
In our happy journey to pilgrimage... That's where we met then. {nl}Na... Naktis! The Demon Lord!{nl}She took away our necklace and orgel, stared at it for some time, and threw it far away!
{nl}Then she made us fight and hate each other for gluttony and just disappeared. {nl}I need to go... To meet her, she, how is she...
The orgel rolled out somewhere and the necklace... Her servant swallowed it. {nl}
Then Naktis made us... like this... {nl}
Oh, sorry. {nl}I'm too dizzy and it's difficult to talk. {nl}There are Nikotias in the Starving Demon's Way that are used as medicinal herbs. Won't the dizziness fade away if I eat some of those herbs?
I heard Nikotias grow in the upper area. {nl}But it's not easy to get it so be careful.
Ah, it's that... Thank you. {nl}It feels better. {nl}Liliya... Her orgel... She probably isn't in this world anymore... Without her, I don't need this necklace either. {nl}
If you meet that nasty Naktis' monster, please strike a revenge for me. {nl}Please take out the sign of our love from it and let it see the light of the world. {nl}And as a sign of gratitude for the revenge, please keep that necklace. {nl}
It's a necklace that received the blessings of the Cathedral so it will come in handy. {nl}That necklace doesn't mean anything to me anymore..
Pilgrim Zenius
What! Move away! I need to protect these precious food supplies!
I almost lost my foods because of you!{nl}
These food supplies are more important than your smelly body! Don't touch it! The only things I need are food! Go away! {nl}The monsters are also annoying!
If you want to talk to me, get rid of the monsters preying on the food or something!
Impressive, but I don't have time to spare for you! {nl}Did you see the one that ran away a while ago? {nl}He made a food stack in Isblyskes Square too! {nl}But I can't leave! Isn't it obvious that someone will steal these food?
{nl}That's why I need you to bring it! {nl}I'm sure the monsters ate the crops! You need to make them spit it out!
You have some good moves! Nice! {nl}It's alright as long as the food is safe. {nl}Now you go ahead on your way.
Tree Root Crystal
Would you like to hit the Tree Root Crystal?
Pilgrim Gracius
Who... Well I'm busy now... I have things left to do.
Ugh...{nl}
Hmm...
Oh... Thank you. I am Gracius. Excuse me on our first meeting. {nl}But since you helped me out, I want to ask for something. {nl}
Souls of pilgrims who were betrayed and unfairly killed are trapped in these altars. {nl}I release them and pray for their souls.. {nl}
It's really difficult because I'm injured but I can't stand not doing it. {nl}Thinking about those colleagues... I pity the angry souls who were not able to go to heaven.{nl}
So can you help me?
I was just trying to release the soul trapped in this altar. {nl}But it didn't go as I expected. {nl}
We need to pray here, and return the souls that were trapped. {nl}But the souls in Scattered Stairway are full of rage so you have to be careful.
I have seen all of it myself. {nl}
As you can see, I was injured when they first appeared so I was listed off. {nl}That's why I saw all of it but still made it alive... so I am trying to release the souls myself. {nl}
Maybe this is my call of become a cleric... Oh ,God...
All the souls scattered... {nl}And I can't move with my legs like this.. {nl}Please, take care of it.
Before heading on the journey, I remember hearing about the Revelator. You truly are special. {nl}
If only I wasn't hurt like this..
They killed the pilgrims like that. I mean each other... {nl}As if they step back and enjoyed controlling people... It's horrible. {nl}One pilgrim's soul was even thrown around by the monster like a toy. {nl}
I take out and release the monsters thrown inside the monsters. {nl}I'm making a drug to take the souls out of the monster... {nl}But it is not going well. {nl}Can you test this?
First, spread it under the monster. {nl}If the soul comes out, then it means success.
I wish it'd go well..
Ah, I guess something is still missing. {nl}What was that... what...
Ahh! I remember! That's it! {nl}That thing the pilgrims carry around!
The Scripture!!!
Please bring it! {nl}One of the pilgrim souls trapped here somewhere must have it!!
This is it!{nl}Oh, thank you. I can finally make the drug!
If you use this, the soul inside the monster will shine. {nl}Defeat those monsters so that the souls may rest in peace.
They were sneaky and careful. {nl}They made the seminarians betray and kill each other. {nl}People who were supposed to become priests and spread the love of the goddess to others betraying and killing themselves, and their souls trapped in the altar for the rage against each other..{nl}
And I mean in the altar where we offer ceremonies to the goddess. {nl}I may be injured but I'm still alive and I can't forgive those monsters. How much more for the pilgrims who were killed like that.. {nl}That's why the souls in the altar are full of anger.
I hope the shining soul will brighten your way. {nl}
They will also be thankful to you.
I felt the peace of souls released even from afar. {nl}
But there are still things left to do. There's a lot of altars in the Scattered Stairway.
Chliz Uphill and Branginti Hills, the alley past Oshimas Road and right before the Purple Tree Fault Forest, there are altars in the these four areas with souls waiting for the day to be free from rage. {nl}Ther are different ways to release the souls, but I'm sure you can figure it out. {nl}
As all things go, it is more difficult to execute than to know. {nl}I will pray here for the souls to rest in peace. {nl}Thank you.
I don't know why they made this place like this. {nl}
It seemed like they were looking for something. {nl}They seemed to be sure that something is here as they harrassed the souls and destroyed the altar. {nl}What could it be.. Could it be related to the Cathedral that lies at the end of this Pilgrim's Way..{nl}
Speaking of the Cathedral, I have a recipe. {nl}Actually, I don't know how to use this thing so I always thought that I'd give it to someone who deserves it. {nl}I think it is right to give it to someone who will make the souls here rest in peace.
Even if you are the Revelator, facing the angry souls is a dangerous thing. {nl}
Please be careful.
It's 4 altars. {nl}There are many ways for the souls to rest in peace. {nl}It may be offering flowers, or gathering the scripture of the pilgrims... {nl}You may need to control the angry souls first.
{nl}I hope my prayers help the souls to find peace.. {nl}And this is just my presumption but if there are any items received after the souls rest in peace, please bring it.
It might be helpful to you. {nl}Of course, this is just my speculation.
You're back. What a relief. And thank you. {nl}
No wonder.. You deserve this recipe. {nl}
I will give you this. {nl}It was a gift from my grandfather who was a blacksmith when I said I will become a cleric. {nl}Although my colleagues found peace, I plan to stay offering ceremonies for them so I don't need it.

I heard that the Purple Tree Fault Forest was damaged by Naktis. {nl}But I didn't know that even the sanctuariues would not function.. I feel bad and angry.
Take this holy water and spray it on the Sanctum. {nl}
I hope this will be enough to purify it.
I hope the Sanctum will be back to normal. {nl}I trust that with you, it will work out well but... Naktis and the Great Cathedral...
Goddess Vakarine Statue of Purple Tree Fault Forest? There are many, but one of them is broken..? {nl}
That's strange. It could be dangerous. {nl}We only have one Goddess Statue in Purple Tree Fault Forest. {nl}Well anyways, since you say it's not functioning..
It might have taken a part of the statue so hunt the monsters nearby. {nl}If my prediction is right, then it must be Naktis' act. {nl}I was away but I've been getting the news. {nl}
If you find water nearby, then try to stick the plaster piece. {nl}There seems to be a problem in the Great Cathedral...
You might have heard about it but since Gesti's defeat, Naktis has been trying to prove her position under Gesti by entering the Great Cathedral. {nl}
That's why she's been ransacking the Pilgrim's Way which is rumored to have the clues. {nl}It will be a difficult journey for you..
I feel bad that I can't go with you as I have things to do here. {nl}
I wish you luck.
You mean the Sanctum in Purple Tree Fault Forest? {nl}
Oh, I heard the rumors but is it that bad?
I guess Naktis is not an easy Demon Lord. {nl}Sounds like the the Sanctum is polluted by monsters near it. {nl}Find the badge of the Sanctum from the monsters nearby and burn it in front of the Sanctum. {nl}
Even if the Sanctum is purified, it might not turn back to it's original form but it will function again.
Naktis must be looking for clues for entering the Great Cathedral. {nl}If my prediction is right, it's not only the Purple Tree Fault Forest but all of Pilgrim's Way that must be that way. {nl}If you do reach the Cathedral, please defeat Naktis. {nl}We have to stop the demons from getting their hand on the goddess' revelations.
You must burn it at the sanctum. Please.
Will you fetch clear water?
Will you prove your faith by offering flowers?
Will you prove your faith by offering money?
That purifier should be enough.
What? Me? {nl}
{nl}What was it? What was I doing...? {nl}I think Naktis told me to stay here...{nl}And I was just hungry...
This place is done. {nl}All crystals have mutated. {nl}We must do everything we can to turn back the crystals.
Please save me. {nl}I didn't know the crystals will be like this. {nl}I feel like slowly dying.{nl}Anyone passing through this place must be careful of the crystals.
If you don't destroy it
I guess I'm dying. {nl}If you're passing through, be careful. {nl}All the Tree Root Crystals are threatening you. {nl}
If you don't disband or destroy it, you might be cursed. {nl}The curse of Demon Lord that killed me.
Pilgrim Theophilis
Uhh... a pilgrim? Oh... Are you the Revelator? You must have some questions for me, but I can't move. {nl}
Water... I need water. Please bring me water.
I don't have the strength to explain in details but... I was fleeing with all the strength I had and became like this.{nl}
I..can't even stand. I'll explain the rest after I get some water...
Maybe gathering some dew from the gravestones down south will help.
Even if it's from the gravestones, dew is still water... I can drink it.
Oh, please give me that. Thank you!
Woah, I think I can live now.
{nl}Hmm?
{nl}Uhm, are you planning to pass through here like that? {nl}No you can't. You might be cursed. {nl}I will make some medicine so take that at least before you go.
{nl}Arrgh, I don't have my bag. {nl}I didn't know I've lost it to the monsters while escaping.. {nl}Hey, if you find me my bag, then I'll make you a medicine that has immune effects against the curse.
It's a bag with all the tools to make the medicine.. {nl}Please find it.
I am interested in different fields so I've learned some techniques.
Yes, that's the one. {nl}Give it to me!
{nl}Looks everything is still left in the bag since it's not food! {nl}What a relief.
I will make you the medicine as promised. {nl}As long as you get me the ingredients...
The Pretense Intersection is no longer a silent road of the pilgrims because of some wild monsters. {nl}All my colleagues who came for pilgrimage with me were attacked. {nl}I started my pilgrimage to decide on my job and mission. {nl}I had craftmanship since I was young and I was interested in medicinal herbs but you can't live doing everything you like. {nl}
I wanted to decide if I want to become a pharmacist, or blacksmith or tanner. {nl}I didn't know I would meet them just before reaching the Great Cathedral... {nl}I was not enticed by them because I took my secret medicine. {nl}Drawing out the greed in people and turning people into their servants.. You need to take the medicine so that you won't suffer from one of their servants.
The monsters pesting on the roots of wide leafed reeds in Sestines Wilderness have the ingredient to the medicine.
They are grumpy so be careful.
Sorry that I can't go with you as my body did not fully recover.
This is the one! Wait for a while. {nl}Although my body is not well yet, I can do this much for someone who got me water...
How is it? {nl}Can you feel it? The effects come slowly..
Aside
I did drink it but is it really effective? {nl}Should I go and test it?
Now that you've taken the medicine, you won't fall under the curse of her servants. {nl}
If I may ask you a favor, there is this one guy full of greed who left for pilgrimage with me... {nl}If possible, please get him back to his senses like you did to me.
I do regret that I did not share the medicine with him.. {nl}The slight guilt...{nl}
Actually, he had some things that he treasured so maybe he might get back to his senses if you show him the things. {nl}
I think the reason he lost his senses is because the trees and spring in Mirsta Lake was polluted. {nl}Just my assumption.
While running away, I saw him drop something near the Meeting Plaza and gravestone of Wedroka Entrance. {nl}Maybe it's there somewhere...
I think it was his mother's belongings. {nl}Although I don't know for sure.
Pilgrim Witas
Arrg! Oh you? Why isn't my curse working? {nl}
Who are you? Even the beauty of the Succubus is not working?
Th-that? What is that? What is that in your hand? Give me that! {nl}
Aaaak, aaakk, aaakk!!!
This place is... Ah... {nl}That is my mother's portrait and handkerchief..{nl}
My mother gave it to me the day before I left my long journey for pilgrimage. {nl}Ah, mother...{nl}
Thank you for getting me back to my senses... {nl}I think I was delusioned to do wrong things to everyone who passed this place.{nl}What should I do for all my sins..
Pretense Stream
Needs to be purified.
Pilgrim soul that was trapped
I was doing the things that I used to despise.. {nl}I am sorry... Being released... I should have thrown away my anger... {nl}I did harsh things to you...
{nl}Yes.. Thank you for saving me. It's so nice like this...
Trapped Soul
Thank you for finding my scriptures... {nl}I couldn't leave this world thinking about the one who tore the scriptures. {nl}Now I can... {nl}Thank you...
Pilgrim's Spirit
I can't forgive the betrayers... {nl}I should stop here. {nl}This is something that I don't need anymore...
Who are you? Are you dazzled by the beauty of the Succubus?
They made me fall into their temptation. {nl}I think it was to curse everyone passing through here and to look for a clue. {nl}Funny that I can't remember it anymore...
I wanted to do a lot of things. {nl}Still same though.. {nl}That's why there was many talks about it. {nl}I'm really talkative for someone who does not have a normal body, right?
Ah, are you done? {nl}The trees and springs here.. Are the source that can keep the Pretense Intersection clean. {nl}What happened...
According to eyewitnesses, something huge and very scary appeared. {nl}It's face seemed like it's all cracked and had thing fingers. {nl}Considering the surroundings here, I think it's more likely that it's plant type than animal type.
You should study the mosses first if you want to study huge plants like that. {nl}Well then, thanks!
Where will I head to next after this?
There must be many rocks with mosses if you go to the deserted ferry. {nl}I want you to get it from different places.
Mosses are indicator plants. {nl}Which means you can study the mosses to guess certain pollutants.
Oh, nice. {nl}Fresh and looks good enough so this should do!
I heard from the soldier in felled area that there is many discolored grass there. {nl}It's not like the weather is cold for it to freeze nor was it colored... What do you think?
I heard the strange grass is in Naudingas Felled Area. {nl}What a relief that you're here. Haha.
Naudangis Felled Area is not that far from here. {nl}But the Vubbes will keep chasing you so better be careful.
You plan to cross this forest? {nl}You can't. This place is seriously dangerous!{nl}
Ahh, I'm Scott. {nl}I'm a member of the Highlander and Peltasta Masters' joint investigation team. {nl}We were ordered to investigate what's happening in here.
I heard that you have great abilities. {nl}So if you insist that you must cross this area... Why don't you just help our investigation?
Oh, now we're talking. I like you. Haha. {nl}First, get me some tree barks those Vubbes are carrying around. {nl}The Vubbes won't carry around tree barks for no reason, don't you think? {nl}
Vubbes are spread all over the area. {nl}They go around in groups so you better be careful.
First, I will investigate because it's fishy but... {nl}
You don't think the Vubbes are up to something, do you? {nl}They are too dumb for that...
You're even better than I thought! {nl}We'll get something if we investigate this. We better do because you brought it!
{nl}Hmm, first, can you deliver the investigations here to Frey?{nl}He's not far from here so you'll find him easily.
It's very unusual like I suspected. {nl}I can feel something evil... It'll need some time to figure it out.
I will look for evidence to who instigated it while you destroy the flag. {nl}Although we didn't catch who it was, I'm sure the demons intervened.
Good. I have one last favor to ask. {nl}Please defeat the Woodspirits. {nl}Then the rumors about something creepy showing up will be gone.
Thanks. {nl}The Woodspirits were sighted in Atsylka Rest Area. {nl}
When this is over, we will trace and find out who did this. {nl}It may be a long fight..
The demons intervening.. Feels like things are getting bigger. {nl}I think I should report this to the head when it is over. {nl}Frey will want to do it himself but it doesn't feel right. Something like it's a different level?
Haha... You're incredibly strong like Scott says, huh? {nl}I didn't imagine you'd defeat the Woodspirit this fast. {nl}I owe you one. Thank you very much. Let's meet again!
I have a favor. {nl}Can you take this Wing Fragment to our Owl Chief at Neuoder Field?
This Wing Fragment is the Brave Owl's. {nl}It's a very sad and painful thing.
This is a fragment of my friend's wing. {nl}It was broken off by the monsters.
Please. Deliver this Wing Fragment to the other owls. {nl}It still has the power of the goddess left in it so it will encourage them. {nl}
This is a fragment of Owl Chief's wing... {nl}Thank you. We will continue to work hard!
The other owls are in Kongfiska Hill and Clover Highland. {nl}I believe that this strength will help at least a bit.
Isn't that a fragment of the chief's wing? {nl}
Be careful. The monsters are flocking in!
Patrol Scout
If you see an unlit bonfire, please light it again. {nl}This place is quite dark even during the day.
May the grace of the goddess of fire, Gabija, be with the bonfire... {nl}This will make it last longer, right?
Writings on Pilgrim Memorial Stone
I'm a gravestone, the stroking hand. {nl}The sculptor placed me here as a sign of undying memory.{nl}
May you have light in your life.{nl}No sadness in your life. {nl}Life is an instant and time will take everything...
I'm requesting because there is a soul that I personally want. {nl}It's a soul with deep grudge. {nl}
The two Soul Stones required to summon his soul can be found in the younger hill of the Siamese Twin Hills. {nl}Please hear my request.
It was an altar long ago but now, it's just ruins. {nl}Life of man maybe is as futile as this.
Oh, this brilliant color. {nl}Yes, this is it. You brought the right one.
Look at this. What a pity. {nl}It's stuck in the Soul Stone yet craving from strength. {nl}But it isn't showing it's true colors yet. {nl}
But what I want is a pure soul. {nl}I want you to place the two soul stones in the holy box and purify it.
What could have possibly happened to make the soul become like that. {nl}Now it's just something that pollutes the holiness... {nl}Interesting.
The wandering of this pitiful soul will end here. {nl}I will keep this with me. {nl}Thank you for listening to the wish of this insignificant tree.
The holy box is located in the older hill of the Siamese Twin Hills...
Look at the Meduja Larvaes roaming around. Aren't they beautiful? {nl}Well, this is what I think. {nl}There must be a reason for these beautiful creatures to become wild and violent..{nl}
The light of Meduja Larvae shine as they absorb memory of the souls roaming around. {nl}So can you gather the Meduja Larvaes?{nl}There are souls who I want to save and I need to read their memory in order to do so.
Meduja Larvae flee away if you approach them. Aren't they cute?
These would be enough to read their memory. Hold on. {nl}
I can feel the heart of the souls around here. {nl}It's near Bonewide Cliff, Sudetas Valley, Stone Hill and Duokliu Hall. {nl}Please check each one of them.
Lingering Escort Soldier
I need to guard my madam but I can't find her. {nl}I need to protect her from the monsters. {nl}But I can't strengthen up my body.
Madam is someone who'd even crawl her way if the carriage breaks down... {nl}At least I have to protect her!
I need to protect Madam no matter what...
Lingering Soul of Merchant
Look what happened to me because of the stupid scholar and sloppy soldier. {nl}Do you think that Madam or whatever is important when I lost my luggage?
It gets me angry that I've gone through all the suffering for nothing.
My fortune is the most important thing for me.
Lingering Soul of Scholar
Did the rescue finally arrive? Did they come to save me? {nl}What? no? {nl}Did Madam fail by any chance? Madam is in danger!{nl}
We need the scroll that the Lapasape stole in order to save Madam. {nl}If we don't deliver the scroll to Madam..!!
We were cowards. We escaped while the escort and merchant were under attack. {nl}There was no way for us to save them..
I regret it a lot. {nl}I should have been brave enough..
Soul of Lost Lady Explorer
Excuse me! Please help me! {nl}Whew, my god! I didn't expect to meet anyone here. {nl}
If we announce that we've found the epitaph of the sculptor, people will recognize our family again. {nl}But strangely, I can't get off my feet. {nl}I need to take down the writings on the epitaph as evidence that it's found..
Thinking of which.. I don't know. I don't know who I am, where I am from.. {nl}My head is full of thoughts about that epitaph and I can't think of anything else.
It was a memorial stone meant to show to humans but the writings must have had powers of calming the souls. {nl}
Desperate Owl Sculpture
Sequoia Flame alone is a critical threat to us. {nl}Those might burn us first. {nl}It's painful and horrible to just think about it.
I don't want to burn. {nl}Please help.
Thank you. Now I don't have to worry about burning. {nl}I'm sick and tired of the Sequoias now.
Please help. There are souls whose bodies I can't save by myself. {nl}Can you take care of their remains at Nuapti Lowland?
They were soldiers heading back home. {nl}But a swarm of monsters suddenly attacked them and...
You've gathered them well. {nl}I hope this will comfort them.
I'm sorry. {nl}I am too weak and wasn't able to comfort them with their remains only. {nl}Maybe the keepsakes that the monsters took would help..
This forest was peaceful just four years ago. {nl}Now it's suffering because of the monsters and crying souls.
Thank you. {nl}I'm sure the soldiers are thanking you too.
This might sound selfish, but.. {nl}I want to give a gift to the souls who followed me. {nl}There's a mysterious bush called Butterfly Fragrance that allows souls to smell the scent of their hometown.
No one would want to forget their hometown. {nl}When I smell Butterfly Fragrance, I also reminisce the days before I became a statue.
Thank you very much. {nl}Now they can rest in peace. {nl}
Please pray for them at the Garden of Consolation later when you have time.
You are a very kind person. {nl}Butterfly Fragrance only grow in bushes at Butterfly Tomb.
We guide souls to Goddess Ausrine. {nl}But it's a big problem now because the number of souls is multiplying while the goddess is not around.
Sad Owl Sculpture
Help! {nl}A Throneweaver is destroying us.
Monsters were around even before. {nl}But ever since that tree emerged in the capital, they began to destroy us. {nl}
Do you think the end of the world is really coming?
One... Two... Three... {nl}Yes, this should be enough.
The Throneweaver likes Sakmoli Roots very much. {nl}If it smells a mix of both, it will jump out right away.
This will be enough to lure it.
Now go back to Tomb Spider Nest again. {nl}Defeat it when it smells the bait and rushes in.
Teach it a lesson so that it won't destroy the owls again.
Thank you. {nl}They will not dare to attack us now.
To the monsters, our magic powers provide them good nourishment. {nl}
But we shouldn't end up like that. {nl}Who else will guide the souls then? {nl}
Shy Owl Sculpture
Something strange is happening. {nl}The souls I've been guiding have suddenly stopped moving. {nl}
I think they were caught at Nelaisve Shore but I have no way of knowing. {nl}Please help me. If we don't save the souls, they will fall to evil.
More and more wandering souls are beginning to suffer. {nl}Maybe someone is doing this on purpose...
Thank you. {nl}Who would do such a thing?
Sad Owl Sculpture
Help me. {nl}Souls are disappearing towards Amolallul Hill. {nl}
I want to find out what is happening. {nl}Please persuade the souls going to the hill and guide them to me. {nl}
The souls are disappearing. What do you think is happening? {nl}{nl}
The souls are saying the Goddess Statue at Amolallul Hill called for them. {nl}But there is no Goddess Statue there...
I'm sure someone did this on purpose. {nl}Please go to Amolallul Hill to find out.
There is no Goddess Statue there. What would they be referring to? {nl}
A monster in disguise as a Goddess Statue. I pity the souls. {nl}Now the souls can rest in peace. It's all thanks to you.
If someone is intentionally intercepting the souls, then it can only be the demons. {nl}Why do you think they would want to break the balance?
You can find Sakmolis near the Tomb Spider Nest.
Officer's Spirit
Can you see me?{nl}Then let me ask you a favor.{nl}I need someone to help us finish our last mission.{nl}{nl}
That Owl Sculpture is not moving an inch. {nl}I heard they guide souls, but I don't think it's true.
Good job. This will be enough.
I will weave this wood to make it human-like. {nl}After this, the crisp skin of Old Kepa at Purple Fountain would be just right. Please do me another favor.
I've spent a long time without salvation. {nl}My men will also be saved if you defeat those monsters.
You've gathered the skin of the Old Kepas? This will be enough. Good.
The decoy is ready. {nl}I'm sorry, but I want you to test this on the monsters at Uzesy Hill for me.
Run away if the decoy fails. {nl}I don't want you to become like me.
The decoy seems alright then. {nl}Follow me to Grobis Crossroads.
Thank you for following me. {nl}Weave in some Ellom Leaves to finish the decoy with hair.
Good work. Now it's time for revenge.
This is my last favor. {nl}It's at Grobis Crossroads. Please finish our last mission with this decoy.
If your life is in danger, don't hesitate to run. {nl}I don't want you to get caught up avenging us.
Whew. Now my men and I can rest in peace. {nl}We will meet the goddess soon. I will pray for her grace towards you.
Thank you. Thank you very much.{nl}First, please get some Legs of Solid Wood from the Bushspiders at Purple Fountain.
Well. I don't know what I'm still doing here. {nl}That Owl that's supposed to guide us is not saying a word either.
Maybe we can go back to the goddess if we achieve what we were not able to. {nl}
That fellow worries a lot. {nl}I said it's not Deadborn but he's still worrying like that.
It's worth a shot if it's Saltistter. {nl}But if it's Deadborn, then I'm out of here.
I never heard of any Deadborn sightings in Kateen Forest.
We had to go through so much to recapture this entrance to Kateen Forest. I don't think Deadborn will appear, would it?
The monsters' endless raids are tiring us. {nl}If you help us and break their assault, then my soldiers can cheer up.
Not knowing what happened to the other troops is frustrating.
Thank you. I can feel relieved for the time being. {nl}Ah, if you see a soldier named Roy, please tell him to return.
We didn't just stay put when we were sieged by the monsters. {nl}We sent out scouts to get away from here but no one came back. {nl}{NP}If it's okay with you, I'd like to ask you to search for them. {nl}
We need every man we have. {nl}I hope nothing happened to them...
You're really trustworthy. {nl}They went up north.
Were you sent by Danus? {nl}You're too late. The others were taken out already.
The monsters will come to attack again soon. {nl}But I can't move right now.
You saved me. I won't ask you to bring me back to camp, though. {nl}Thank you for saving my life!
This is a method I used when I was alive. {nl}It was mostly successful back then.
The Supply Squad should have arrived already, but they are late. {nl}I'm sure something happened to them. Can you search for them in the lower area?
I'm sure we can find our way out of here if we can find the Supply Squad.
Are you from the Rearguard Unit? {nl}I'm sorry we've been so late. {nl}
But we are all very tired. {nl}If you want to help us get back to the Rearguard Unit Camp, please help us gather the scattered supplies.
All kinds of monsters attack us when we have supplies. {nl}We need more soldiers, but we haven't received any, no matter how much backup we requested.
Thank you. {nl}This will be enough to cover for us.
Right now, it would be best for our troops to join with Danus' troops. {nl} We will join them soon after a little rest so please deliver them the food supplies first.
We are sorry for delivering the supplies late. {nl}But this is the situation of most supply troops.
What happened? {nl}Is the Supply Squad well on their way? {nl}
At least the food supplies were delivered first. {nl}Good work. {nl}
Danus ordered me to return? {nl}I can't return until I collect a Puragi's Hook.
My mission is more important than his order to return. {nl}If we were to consider priorities, I mean.
Thank you for your help. {nl}But do I just return to Danus' troops?
Have you seen a soldier named Roy? {nl}
You mean you returned him to the Rearguard? {nl}That's bad. We're short on men. You are partly responsible for that now, so you better cooperate.
Blood will be shed soon. {nl}I pity you for going in Roy's stead.
So, just as I've heard. {nl}
The next mission is to find my missing scouts. {nl}They were sent to Razygis Hill but have not returned for hours.
The scout unit was attacked, myself included. {nl}I hope I can at least find the report to send to sir Philipas...
Our squad is all dead because of my incompetence. {nl}I'm the only one alive but I don't think I have much time left either.
This report is completely soaked in blood and unreadable. {nl}I can't stand that my men's efforts were all for nothing.
There is one last favor I would like to ask you. {nl}The remains of my men are up in the hills. Please take care of them.
I feel sorry for them being abandoned amongst the monsters.
Thank you.{nl}My men can now rest in peace. {nl}
Oh, I've found some readable parts from my men's reports. {nl}Please tell sir Philipas that the monsters will attack the regular troops soon.
...Is that so? I guess it's too late for the scouts. {nl}I swear to treat them with respect. {nl}
According to Johan's report, we better strike them from behind. {nl}I will meet you in Isdaigininko Highway.
Revenge is best served cold. {nl}Even for Johan and his men.
You're here. {nl}Are you ready? {nl}
The battle has begun. Troops have entered Isdaigininko Highway already. {nl}It will be a big help if you fight with them.
The plan will not fail. {nl}I promise this to Johan's troops.
It looks like you've done more than Roy's part. {nl}If it wasn't for you, we would not have been successful. {nl}
I hope the blessings of the goddess are with you on your journey.
I can't close my eyes before we defeat that monster.
When will this pitiful feeling end. {nl}When I look at the souls, I don't think it will end.
I can suffice with delayed supplies or reinforcements. {nl}But telling us to just wait around is too much.
I'm afraid where the monsters will jump out from. {nl}I plan to run away if an unknown monster shows up.
We're making up for the lacking supplies. {nl}If the supplies don't arrive, we have to cover for it on site.
Somehow, at least sir Philipas' troops...
There was another route that we used before. {nl}But it got like this when that gigantic tree suddenly emerged. {nl}
We're clearing up this route to make it easy for supplies but.. {nl}As if the monsters isolating us was not enough, now there are no news of supplies, and the soldiers are becoming weary.
I'll be grateful if you can do that. {nl}If you relieve us from their attacks, it might even boost the troop's morale.
I want to let go of everything and just rest. {nl}But thinking of my men..
The monsters are swallowing my companions. {nl}This never happened before that big tree emerged in the capital...
There are more and more wandering souls, {nl}and souls that are suddenly disappearing. It's really scary.
First, you have to find the hiding Throneweaver. {nl}Please gather Ridimed Leaves. The Throneweaver loves it. {nl}{nl}
Good. {nl}First, defeat the Big Blue Grivas up the hills and put a damper on them.
I feel regretful. I can't close my eyes like this.
I have a request. Please save my companions. {nl}They will be eaten if we don't save them quickly.
There is a monster's nest at the end of this road. {nl}My colleagues may still be alive there.
Thank you. {nl}My colleagues were taken to the nest at the end of the road.
I can't feel the owl that guides the souls at Ishrai Crossroads. {nl}I'm worried that it may have been attacked by the monsters.
I hope nothing happened to it...
Monsters' attacks are becoming stronger and there is no news from the troops that went out. {nl}This is not good.
Thank you. {nl}I thought I would lay dormant forever like this. {nl}
It's confusing. {nl}There seems to be something with Lydia Schaffen and Ruklys... but they're still traitors, right?
(You cannot read it because it's broken.)
We are after an unknown monster. {nl}I hope it's not Deadborn, but I feel like it is. Can you help us?
That's weird. I think I saw a Deadborn.. {nl}What do you think?
Dear Revelator, please lend us your strength! {nl}We're fighting against Saltistter and us alone is not enough.
You're great, as expected! Commander Vacenin wants to meet you. Go to the camp quickly.
Soldier Rudolfas
Even if you're the Revelator, this place is too dangerous. {nl}Please go to a safe area.
What did I tell you? {nl}Thanks for your help but you should turn back quickly.
Soldier Aspas
I was careless. {nl}It would be big trouble if the monsters attacked now.
You saved me. {nl}Do you know what happened to my colleagues?
Meleech swallowed Dominic's engagement ring. {nl}I did lose it, it's really terrible.
This place is too dangerous for citizens to go around. {nl}Go to a safe area.
I understand that you are strong but it's dangerous to go around alone here.
I could have supported O'Rourke and the troops, if only I was not injured...
This place is dangerous. {nl}Especially with Ironbaum around, I have not seen such a violent monster before.
There are still many who have not yet returned. {nl}Do we really have to go through all this danger to clear a path to the Gorge Area...
I'm safe thanks to my colleagues. {nl}I did not think we could defeat Ironbaum.
Bishop Aurelius' Spirit
Revelator.. It was a long time. {nl}I have awaited centuries to guide you. {nl}
This Great Cathedral is a legacy of Maven, the first bishop, and a sanctuary with a revelation. {nl}But I am unable to leave this precise area. {nl}As it stands, I have no power to aid the holy mission.
It has been worth the long wait. {nl}Although my body is like this, I am overflowing with emotion right now.
This will be enough.
I believe a scripture will hold the Spirit Essences well enough. {nl}Unfortunately, they are all at Pamaldu Groom. {nl}
Although I'm just a spirit, I have offered myself to the goddess. {nl}I want to be placed in a scripture.
Are you done with the ritual? {nl}Check if this scripture can call me correctly.
Splendid. {nl}Now you must solve the secret of the Great Cathedral and get the revelation. {nl}
Of course, there will be hardship. {nl}The burden of the holy mission will surely weigh down on your shoulders. {nl}
But only you and the goddess can save this world..{nl}Even knowing my body would turn out like this, I desired to guide you.
Don't worry. You just have to finish the bowl to hold me. {nl}First, gather the Essence of Soul. {nl}
Oh, the vessel should be completed at the Altar of Stability. {nl}I have spent centuries without a body, so I hope you get a decent scripture.
It's simple. {nl}Use the scripture of soul in your inventory.
Cleric
This Great Cathedral is like a repository of knowledge. {nl}Of course, that should mean that we can find how to release Naktis' curses.
I'm roughly done studying this area, but we need the reports of clerics from other areas. {nl}If you meet other clerics in the Great Cathedral, can you get their reports for me?
If we've got the reports, even Naktis' curse will just be as if it were a mere spell. {nl}Yup, that's right. Great work. {nl}
Isn't it scary in here? {nl}Even the Owl Sculpture feels gloomy..
I've heard about sightings of souls with resentment. {nl}If it's true.. Uhh, you're not one of them, are you?
Grave Keeper Romas
Being a Revelator doesn't mean that you can roam around freely tomorrow as you do today.
Every Revelator who said that they were different never really made it far.
This is no place for civilians to pass by and it won't happen anytime soon. {nl}It's too dangerous.
My colleagues are still inside. {nl}It's frustrating because there's no way to know what happened to them.
I can't forgive them for making the tower such a mess.
You better watch out. {nl}Why do you think even the wizards ran away?
We can help Goddess Gabija if we have the Jewel of Prominence.
Now that the trasport magic circle is destroyed, we have to go head to head.
I think I can remember something... But first, it's important to go to the goddess.
Uhg, my head aches.. {nl}Maybe it's because of the crazy old man a while ago...
This is endless. I want to just burn it all.
I will make them pay for doing this to our tower!
I can't stay down like this when you've helped so much.
Even if the odds are against you, you can turn the tables if you make the perfect formation. {nl}But this is all useless for you if you enjoy solitude.
They're all dead or ran away. {nl}I guess I'm the only one left in this floor. Those cowards.
It's a big mistake to look down on Corsairs in ground battles. {nl}As long as there is a place to set foot, we are unbeatable.
Eternity... Look at Tesla. {nl}You don't think that there is no agedness in eternal life, do you?
Don't compare me to the old folk who carve owls out of mere tree logs. {nl}I always use the best materials.
Supply Soldier
I don't know about the frontlines but it makes no sense to complain to the Rearguard Unit. {nl}The Rearguards must work well for supplies to make it through.
I can't even count how many monsters I had to fight on my way here. {nl}
Being in this battle for so long, I even wonder if there really was a goddess. {nl}I wonder if this is a dream, or whether we can wake up from it.
Even with the escort troops protecting us, I almost got myself killed twice.
The supply troop is safer compared to other troops. {nl}But they do a lot more manual labor, so people avoid it.
The longer the battle goes on, the more soldiers are deserting. {nl}It's really frustrating.
I understand that leaving the supplies and running away means failing the mission. {nl}But you need to be alive to deliver the supplies, don't you?
Revelation of Great Cathedral
If this revelation reaches you, then it would mean that Maven accomplished his mission splendidly.{nl}Here, I would like to tell you about the principles of a world different from this one.
There is another world beyond the world that you live in. {nl}You cannot cross both worlds unless you have supreme powers. {nl}At least, that was before the Divine Tree emerged. {nl}
The aftermath of the disaster left a wound, opening cracks that divided these two worlds. {nl}And then, the demons freely crossed between worlds through the dimensional crack. {nl}
The dimensional crack is scattered across many places. {nl}But the biggest problem would be the one in Demon Prison where the most dangerous demons are imprisoned.
If the demons join the ones from Demon Prison through the dimensional crack.. {nl}It will be another threat to this world. {nl}
I have told Vakarine to prepare for it. {nl}But the uncertainty brought by the torn demons might catch up with her. {nl}
The gap, once opened, will continue to widen. {nl}Dear Savior, please help Vakarine as quickly as you can. {nl}{nl}
Bishop
You've arrived. Maven's device is in here. You need to step on both footsteps to release the device.
Whew, this is really endless. {nl}I don't know how much longer I can take it.
We need to stand up again. {nl}Your help gave me the strength to defeat the monster.
Dying Pilgrim's Message
Most of the Tree Root Crystals in Ray-lit Land are rotten. {nl}It curses, decomposes, and turns into monsters. {nl}It must be destroyed before more disasters strike.
{nl}I don't know who will read this note. {nl}Some Tree Root Crystals have inserted it's core in monsters. {nl}You can destroy at least a pillar if you bring the monster and see it's reaction to the pillar.
Well done. {nl} Now to continue hereafter at this pace.. {nl}
About the second secret.{nl}Unfortunately, the demons of Naktis made their move first. {nl}
I'm relieved we got it back. {nl}I finally get to see the holy relic after death. {nl}
Bring that holy relic to the Small Hall and place it on top of the altar. {nl}Only then will you be able to get the first key of Maven.
I am studying how to release the curse of Naktis. {nl}Can you get me some monster samples for the poor people who are under the curse of monsters?
It would have been nice if the Church sent us enough people. {nl}Oh, I better test the samples you brought.
Oh no, that's a bland reaction. {nl}I'm sure each curse has it's own characteristic, but it seems like there's a key to it..{nl}
I think I need to test again rather than just imagining it. {nl}I'm sorry but can you get me a different monster sample this time?
I thought I just had to match the properties of the monster but it seems like the opposite. {nl}Naktis.. What could be moving that demon?
Oh, I heard from Titas but I didn't think that's you. I feel reassured. {nl}Well then, please support the monster extermination mission.
The other clerics are at the Grand Corridor, Penitence Route, and the Sanctuary. {nl}Research is important but I hope they are safe. {nl}{nl}If you see the other clerics, please send them my regards. {nl}They are in dangerous places.
Priest Inea
Why is the goddess leaving those blasphemous monsters alone... {nl}Is this also the will of the goddess?
It's not easy to get samples. {nl}There is not enough for research too.
Ah, there was definitely a reaction this time. {nl}I would have had a hard time if it wasn't for your help. Thank you!
We need to take care of it before it reaches Naktis. {nl}Please defeat the demons and find the holy relic of salvation.
Priest of Evidence
Did you find the herbs?
Give me the herbs.
I need herbs to make the medicine.
Completed preparing medicine.
You need to get all of Maven's keys first. {nl}And you need to solve a lot of secrets to get the key.
Unfortunately, it is Maven's will that you solve every secret by yourself. {nl}First, get on the platform at the Meile Oratorium to solve the first secret and get the Holy Relic of Mercy.
Writing on the Platform
Remember the holy number with your two eyes. {nl}The light of candles drives away the evil dark.
You must thoroughly check the writings on the altar. {nl}Well then, I will.. wait in the Grand Hall.
You must have seen the recruitment notice. {nl}It's true that we lack military manpower.
The person in charge of the mission in Soul Peak is Julian. {nl}He will probably welcome you with open arms.
That was great. You were of great help to this mission. {nl}What do you think about enlisting to the army?
Can that thing even be broken? {nl}What the.. I'm at a loss for words to say. {nl}
But you have to pay for damaging public facilities. {nl}Sorry but you have to fix the wooden seal.
Thank you for saying that. {nl}I guess it is better to support Julian's troops in Soul Peak than here.
I'm planning to exterminate the monsters interfering the route to Gorge Area.
I heard the Pirent Wood in Jade Filled Cliff is solid and elastic. {nl}You can get ropes to tie those from the Red Panto Spearmans. Get me those first.
Villager Darren
Are you the one sent by Joseph of Klaipeda? {nl}Well even if you aren't, please help our village. {nl}
We were fine even during Medzio Diena, but sometime ago, the bees suddenly turned into monsters. {nl}The other bee farms have already become a mess, and now I'm worried how our bee farm will fare.
Our town lived on bee farming and mead. {nl}Goddess Austeja looks after us so we were better off than other villages.
And then, on Medzio Diena, our once-normal bees suddenly turned into monsters. {nl}That and Goddess Austeja disappeared, with the priests telling us to wait for her return.. {nl}These days have been frustrating.
Really?{nl} The other Revelators just ignored us... {nl}Ours is the Rododun Apiary just down the road. Thank you.
I hope nothing happened. {nl}We put a lot of effort in the farm. We can't just lose it.
The bee farm is alright? What a relief. {nl}I got to think of a way to protect the bee farm now, quickly.
The monsters from other forests are also a problem in addition to the bees. {nl}I'm sure they are preying on honey.
Oh, how about this? {nl}We'll fool the monsters with empty beehives. {nl}If there is no honey, why would the monsters bother attacking the apiary?
When was it. I think it was around the same time the bees turned to monsters. {nl}A huge flock of monsters marched into our village. I've never seen that many monsters before. {nl}
At first, they only gathered around Swaying Arable Land and Spring Light Woods. {nl}But it wasn't long before they moved onto here. {nl}I'm sure they are aiming for the honey.
The monsters that smell sweet must have empty beehives. {nl}Goddess Austeja, we will need to borrow some of her help here.
You got one! {nl}I hope this will be enough to fool them.
By the way, I'm worried about the brewery of Mr. Dorjen. {nl}He must be fuming after seeing his life's work ruined by monsters.{nl}
I think he's been planning to burn the entire forest.. {nl}And he is not listening to us. Can you stop him?
He spread out oil barrels near Micolas Brewery. You must get rid of those first. {nl}And about Mr. Dorjen.. Please help him.
Brewer Dorjen
What could the Revelator possibly want from me.. {nl}
Hmm? Aren't these my cork stoppers? {nl}Did you just ruin my plan? {nl}
Don't you dare think of stopping me. {nl}I am going to blow them up, even if it's going to cost me my brewery! {nl}..Can't even trust Revelators anymore now.
The monsters ruined the beefarm and brewery. {nl}So Joseph went to Klaipeda to look for Revelator who could help us. {nl}{NP}I thought the problem would be solved but guess what happened. {nl}They started disappearing one by one. They backed out. Those cowards.
Calm down? Do I look like I can calm down?! {nl}Okay. Maybe I can calm down if you get my signature mead from the Honey Wine Warehouse. {nl}That's if you can get it.
I bet you won't be able to get it. {nl}Just know that if you fail, I will burn down my workshop.
What in the world.. did you actually get that? {nl}I thought you would give up because of the monsters... You are really remarkable.
Alright. You win. I won't burn down my workshop as I said. {nl}But I'm still pissed. All those years of work... because of those monsters..{nl}
Thank you very much. {nl}I will feel much better if you do that.
I won't think about burning down the forest again. {nl}I'm sure a person with abilities like yours can save our village.
That is enough. Whoa, Joseph did find great talent,{nl} even though we lost the apiary and brewery. {nl}
I guess I can trust you unlike other Revelators. {nl}If it's alright, can you go to Maras in Three Brooks Wood?
Kirina
I followed Darren here because I was worried for him, but what can I do now? {nl}There are so many monsters, I'm worried if I could even make it back.
The monsters here all seem like they're possessed by something, it's scary. {nl}Now that I think about it, they all seemed to have our honey stuck on them...
Thank you. Now how do I get back from here...{nl}Isn't it ironic, that the very bees that are beholden to us have now become monsters?
Cleopas
I can't take it anymore. Do you know Mikolas? {nl}Oh you wouldn't know. He's a guy I really adore. {nl}
He started getting mad at me since some time ago and now he wouldn't even look at me. {nl}I have no clue why. I should know the reason at least to apologize or something.
Oh, that is some sweet advice. {nl}He wouldn't get mad at someone he sees for the first time, would he?
Why do you think he is mad? {nl}Can you guess why?
Mikolas
Oh Cleopas... What a shame on him to ask someone else's help. {nl}He borrowed my brewing machine, sold it somewhere, and now acts like he doesn't know about it?
How could he do that to me when I was so good to him? {nl}He even lied about it. He said he placed it in front of my workshop but I never received it.
Is Mikolas not ready yet?
How could he do this to me?{nl}Mikolas...
What? That doesn't make sense.{nl}I really left it at my brother's workplace.{nl}
Ah, probably.. it may have been done by Elite Chukaruka.{nl}I saw it licking the brewing device. {nl}Can I ask one more time? What do you think?
Thank you so much!{nl}I saw an Elite Chukaruka Dvikcoji Rest Area.{nl}If you find the brewing device by any chance, please let Mikolas know.
I hope the Elite Chukaruka took it.{nl}If not.. I don't wanna see his disappointed face.
Oh, Isn't that my brewing device?{nl}Where did you get it?
Oh my god. I owe you a lot.{nl}And my Cleopas.. I can't lift up my face.{nl}
I have a favor to ask you.{nl}Please obtain some royal jelly and hand it over to Cleopas.{nl}Cleopas really likes it.
Us?{nl}We are best friends who grew up in the same village.{nl}
By the way, why are you asking?
Ahah, thank you so much.{nl}You will be able to obtain royal jellies form the monsters nearby.
If it weren't you, we would have never gotten closer again.
Um? Isn't this royal jellly?{nl}Mikolas... It is so fortunate. I was able to get rid of the misunderstanding because of you.{nl}May the Austeja bless you.
Maras
Was it you who Joseph was looking for? {nl}I don't care if you're not. {nl}If you don't help me, you will be the same as those Revelators who ran away.{nl}
After all, I've placed all of my faith in the priests, but I just can't it any longer.{nl}That's why I want to hire someone who is skillful like you. {nl}I will compensate you well.
I don't know what the priests are doing, because anyone would know that the monsters are after the honey.
I made a request to Klaipeda, but they have not been responding since they lack the manpower.{nl}And it is not easy to hire mercenaries in this area.{nl}
Thus, the only ones I can count on are the Revelators.{nl}You're looking for a goddess? We once had a goddess in our village.
Look carefully for undamaged beehives.{nl}With luck, you might obtain some beehives that are in good condition.
Oh, this one is quite big.{nl}Good job.
Now, go to Vulvini Farm.{nl}If we could provide proof that the monsters are after the honey, the priests should stop only thinking about their altars.{nl}
There are many altars around here.{nl}You know about them already, no? They were all created to praise Goddess Austeja.
The disciples are only concentrating on the altars so they don't care whether we die in hunger or not.{nl}They think everything will be solved if they pray hard.{nl}That's why we decided to take an action.
With a beehive that huge, you will definitely lure monsters.
How was it? How did they react?
No response?{nl}Darn.. So they weren't just going after the honey.{nl}
The monsters have been gathering near Bichiu Altar, so I figured they might be amassing honey there.{nl}But if they're not after the honey, maybe they're there for something else.
You will find Bichiu Altar if you go down the road from here. {nl}If you see something suspicious, please bring it to me.
You came back sooner than I expected.{nl}How was it? What did you see?
So the monsters were going after this fragment?{nl}This is my first time seeing it... I should first check Gaudeji Altar up there.
If something suspicous comes out like a while ago, please hand it over to Lamar who is near the tree observatory tower.{nl}I really... don't know.
Lamar
Maras told you to show me this?{nl}This is the very object that the priest stressed to us not to touch, was it broken like this originally?
I should talk to Maras about this.{nl}Something doesn't feel right... What could this be used for?
Riesz
The monsters ruined all the fields so I was trying to start from scratch again.{nl}And then of all a sudden, a Honeypin showed up, so I left everything and ran away.{nl}My farming tools.. I don't know what to do now.
Thank you so much.{nl}The place where I lost it is Shirsie Sunny Place.{nl}The Honeypin is huge and scary, so don't overdo it if you can't handle it.
Ah, yes, these are the ones.{nl}Everything would've been okay if we villagers could take care of the monsters.
Valda
Maras told us to gather as many empty beehive fragments as we can, but that doesn't make sense at all.{nl}That implies we defeat the monsters, which we can't!{nl}
I beg you.{nl}Please think of it like saving a person and collect those beehives for me.
Really? I am so touched.{nl}Ah, the beehives are at Saldus Bee Farm.{nl}
I can't do it this time, even if we lose all of this year's supply of honey.{nl}We may be better off just worrying about lost farming tools like Riesz.
Wow, they are so fragrant! {nl}Thank you so much. {nl}Ah, please keep this a secret from Maras, okay?
We shouldn't stop farming even if the monsters are making a mess.{nl}But the monsters are still scary. Can you help me? It's not that hard.
Really? Thank you!{nl}Please sow these seeds at Radanza Farm. Okay, I am counting on you!
After you sow the seeds, they will grow by themselves.{nl}Of course, you should take care of them sometimes while avoiding monsters.
I am relieved for now.{nl}The rest will be okay when Maras and Lamar get rid of the monsters.
Priest Raeli
Goddess Austeja is sealing two spots that are the source of the vicious energy.{nl}However, due to demons' continuous attacks, the seal is getting weaker.{nl}
That's why we lured the demons into demonic stones...{nl}Hasty behavior from the villagers created the trouble.
There is no way you can say you have nothing to do with this.
I don't know if Medzio Diena was the cause, but since some time ago,{nl}the evil energy began to dwell deep underground.{nl}The energy has accumulated so much, it could explode anytime now.{nl}
Goddess Austeja has been trying her best to seal that energy with her power.{nl}If she had not done that, this forest might have very well turned into a thorn forest.{nl}
A land where the only living creatures are monsters.. a devastated land.{nl}
I would briefly explain the situation to you now, but I sense monsters coming this way.{nl}We've prepared a guardian stone at the edge of the village for times like this.
I am relieved by your words.{nl}If we can't hold them back all of Siauliai Woods may be destroyed, so I am counting on you.{nl}
I will explain everything to you in detail after you come back.{nl}Please get rid of the monsters.
I am now a little relieved.{nl}My greeting was a bit late. I am Priest Raeli serving Goddess Austeja.
The purification back then?{nl}Unlike the other Revelators who succumbed to the evil energy, I purified you in the name of the goddess.{nl}
The goddesses have already blessed the villagers, they just don't know about it.{nl}The goddesses don't want chaos.
It is good to hear that you feel involved.{nl}
We need to purify those demons to obtain something.{nl}Please obtain the branches of the bee trees near the village. They are endowed with the power of Goddess Austeja.
We should get this done quickly, before the monsters rush in again.
You brought them. Good.{nl}
Remember how I said that there are two sources of evil energy?{nl}For them both, I will make an orb that will restore the seal for this area.
First, bring me some demons' ashes that I will make the orb with.{nl}When the demons are pierced with these bee tree branches,{nl}they will be overwhelmed by the branch's divine power and turn into ash.{nl}
Obviously, the goddess' powers can only indirectly affect demons. {nl}You will have to exhaust some of the demon's HP before using a branch on it.
Well done. {nl}It is uncomfortable to use the demons as sacrifice but... we're now reaching the final stage.
Take this orb. I made it in a hurry, so it's not complete yet. {nl}You must fill it with magic at a place that is full of the goddess' holy energy.
Palama Cliff is the nearest place you can do this at, so please head there. {nl}The demons will be marching in soon, so please hurry.
This will be enough. {nl}Please prepare before you restore the seal. It might become a tough battle.
The weakened seal tower is near Stulr Road. {nl}I'm getting a little bothered about how quiet the demons have been recently.
Please hurry. I can feel that the seal is weak. {nl}May you have the goddess' blessings..
I believe you are the Revelator who purified the sealed tower?
I have been suppressing the evil energy here.
Please restore the seal tower at Spring Light Woods.
After the evil energy gushed out, plants mutated and enlarged abnormally. {nl}It seems dangerous, so I just watched from afar but it fumed out an ominous energy. {nl}I'm worried those mutated plants might harm the villagers.
That would be so thankful. {nl}But you don't know how dangerous it could be so be careful.
So could it be the evil forces that turned it to become so grotesque?
Ah... the monsters were hiding in it. {nl}But it's a relief that you defeated it.
Greedy Druva
Let me tell you a secret not even the villagers know about. {nl}I went all the way to Fedimian and bought this expensive charm. {nl}They said it will drive away the monsters. {nl}
And so... {nl}I want to ask for your help putting a scarecrow up with this charm. Hehe.
I knew you'd get it. {nl}Now, if you want to put up a scarecrow, you'll have to gather the ingredients first. {nl}Please get me some planks of Oak Wood from around the village.
I'd be really rich if things go well this time. Hehe..
That's a lot. {nl}It sure is good enough.
Now, please put this scarecrow up with this charm attached to it on my farm. {nl}I want to watch the fun up here by myself.
The farm is located on the left of Arkllui Crossroads. {nl}It's a bit far but that's how I stay low from the villagers.
Ruined Bee Farmer Logen
It's all gone... I have lost everything... {nl}I took care of the beehives for years... and the monsters destroyed everything. {nl}The priest told me to persevere, but...
Are you trying to cheer me up? {nl}Then nothing would be better than teaching those monsters a lesson in pain.
I know the priest is right, but I can still rant about it, right?
That makes me feel better. {nl}How I wish they'd all be gone forever.
Priest Dazine
Revelator. I assume you've heard the story from Goddess Austeja. {nl}That there are a number of Revelators who were addled by the evil energy attacking the village while trying to restore the seal here. {nl}
There is a way to save them. {nl}We can purify them if we find the symbol of Goddess Austeja.
First regain the goddess' symbol and then use it to restore the Austeja Altar. {nl} Purifying the Revelators will come next.
Whether it's to restore the weakened seal or to cure the addled Revelators, {nl}We will need that symbol.
The damage is worse than at the seal in the shaking field. {nl}The evil forces are fuming out stronger.
Fortunately, the goddess blessed the villagers with her divine protection before focusing her effort on the seal... {nl}The Revelators from before had no way of knowing about this, their fates were sealed.
This is it, Revelator. {nl}This will save the addled Revelators.
The addled Revelators will march towards here soon.{nl}Please purify them before anyone gets hurt.
Luckily, they did minimal damage. {nl}Now, if we can restore the seal, this will never have to repeat.
Restore the weakened seal towers using the symbol of Goddess Austeja.{nl}There is the Rankis Seal and the Ranka Seal.
The demons found out about the source of evil energy and so relentlessly attacked to destroy the seal. {nl}I'm sure if the seal is strengthened well this time, they will retreat after a while.
We don't know what will happen next, though.{nl} We just have to believe that Goddess Austeja will take care of everything if anything happens.
One thing that worries me is that... {nl}The symbol was destroyed once so it might not be fully restored again. {nl}Of course, everything will depend... on the goddess...{nl}
Merchant Dulke
Oh no, what do I do? {nl}I lost all my wares while running away from the monsters. {nl}But I'm afraid I might lose my mind like the other Revelators if I go back for it now.
At a glance, you wouldn't be able to tell if they are a human or a monster. {nl}They would have a blank, soulless stare and when called, it would disappear while making a strange noise.
And there are more than just one or two of them. {nl}Yet, I think the people in our village are still normal...{nl}Could the goddess have protected us with her blessings?
Please help me. {nl}I just started my business with everything I got, and now I'm afraid I'm about to end up with nothing.
Oh, I could never thank you enough... yes, this is my stuff. {nl}And I thought it was weird that you were fine, unlike the other Revelators. You truly are a special one.
Villager Emil
I used to travel in and out of town, but the priests told me to stay put, saying the seal is dangerous.{nl}That seal really is nothing for me, it's the demons that are scary.
I have to have a livelihood. {nl}The other villagers here just spend all day looking up to the priests and the goddess.
I've seen other Revelators here that got all weird, but you seem fine.{nl}Did you meet the goddess or something? {nl}Well, you did some great work. I wish I was as strong as you are.
Pharmacist Tiana
Priest Dazine asked me for medicine to cure the future addled Revelators with,{nl}but I ran out of Spring Light Grass... and I'm also scared of the demons.
You're such a sweet person. {nl}Oh, Spring Light Grass is not easy to find. {nl}It only appears when it's reacting to this honey jelly.
Thank you for so much help. {nl}I'm sure this will be more than enough for the priest.
Church Candlestick
The Church Candlestick is not lit.
When that tree started to destroy the capital, the wheel of fate turned towards destruction. {nl}Laima said only a human could be chosen as the one to end that cycle.
I can feel a very strong force of the demon flowing in front.
You can't enter it now becuase the doors are sealed. {nl}Pass by the Tikinciuju Gallery and into the room. You'll find the barrier candlestick. {nl}The sealed door will open when you blow the candle.
The portal to the bishop's hidden room opened. {nl}You can go in the portal.
There was a sect to move all the relics to somewhere safe. {nl}But look at how horrible things have turned out.
How can they do this to the sacred things that contain the words of the great bishops...{nl}It's so resentful to see it just scattered among those blasphemous monsters.
Fortunately it does not seem damaged. {nl}If only I was stronger, I would have purified those monsters in the name of the goddess.
Some relics hide themselves when they feel an evil force. {nl}When that happens, you just can't find it no matter how hard you try.
That's why I brought the beads that can detect holiness{nl}but look at those monsters' eyes. {nl}They might kill us as soon as we find the sacred things.
Yes, good work. {nl}We've found the important things so we can ask the sisters for the other things.
The priests in the Great Cathedral were sent to release the curse of Naktis in the Pilgrim's Way. {nl}In my case, I'm looking for important documents but preferably those related to Naktis.
If you don't mind, can you help me find documents related to Naktis?
A lot of the Great Cathedral's facilities and documents were lost on Medzio Diena. Moreover, even the demons are damaging the facilities and documents further.
What about the documents?
Thank you for finding this much.
If you find any documents around the Great Cathedral, I want you to bring them to me.
What a trick those demons used... I don't think retrieving the documents will be easy as long the demons are here.
The demons stole all the documents I gathered.
The demons are obsessing over the things to the point it seems really weird. {nl}Last time, the demons stared at the wall for a while then started smashing it.
And even funnier, they took the fragments from it and left off somewhere.
You found it all back. Thank you.
Something urgent happened. Naktis' servants began attacking Maven's device. The demons will find the things Maven hid and take it to Naktis.
We have to get it back before it reaches the hands of Naktis.
The demons took away the things I got from my friend.
I don't know why but the demons are showing obsession over the things.
There are two Maven's devices left. {nl}But a problem occurred.
I don't know how to release one device.
There are Naktis' servants around the device so be careful.
Were you able to gather the data? Great, hand it to me.
The data says you need monster's fur, leather, or clothes that it wore. {nl}Defeat Naktis' servants nearby and get their leather and clothes.
You must be extremely careful of Naktis' servants.
You got all the materials.
Use the pot at the end of Laukti Narthex and make the medicine.
There is a pot at the end of Laukti Narthe which you can use to make it.
Go to the first device of Maven and get the key. {nl}Then go to the second device.
I am a priest sent to release the curse that is spread in Pilgrim's Way. {nl}There is a cursed pilgrim in this Penitence Route who I want to experiment with.{nl}Can you help me?
He won't take the medicine easily. {nl}Apply it on the meat so that he'll eat it.
It doesn't matter what it is as long as it's edible.
This should be enough.
Defeat the monsters nearby and get meat.
I'll give you the medicine. {nl}Apply it on the meat.
Apply the medicine on the meat.
Give the meat to the pilgrim.
Give meat to the pilgrim and observe his reaction.
Did the pilgrim eat the meat with medicine?
Thank you for your help.
I feel hungry no matter how much I eat...{nl}Hey... Please give me more food.
Give me some food, quickly.
I am part of the priests who were sent to release the curse of Naktis. {nl}We must study and collect data in order to release the curse of Naktis. {nl}But I have to find the bishop who said he'd protect the Cathedral after Medzio Diena. {nl}
Will you help me find him?
Oh no... The bishop returned as a corpse... {nl}Thank you for your help.
I need to bury the bishop but there are too many monsters around.
I shouldn't have left him in the Great Cathedral...
I received your help again. Thank you very much.
I'm worried about the whereabouts of the bishop.
Use Naktis' monsters... {nl}But how can we use them... {nl}Aha! We can turn into Naktis' monsters from the Sanctum and make the other monsters destroy it.
There are materials in the Sanctum with instructions on how to make a medicine that turns you into a monster. {nl}Find those materials.
Now it's time to tell Naktis' monsters where Maven's device is located.
I fell while holding the materials, and they slid under that device. {nl}It keeps moving up and down making it difficult to get them out.
That was close.
I'm sure Naktis' monsters took it. {nl}We better find the key quickly.

Julius... I am sorry...
Hey... I am so hungry, I can't move at all.{nl}Anything will do, please get me something to eat.
The meat of those monsters over there will do.{nl}Please hurry..
Not yet?{nl}I am so hungry that I feel like I could even eat a handful of dust...
Meat? Are you going to eat it?{nl}Yes.. Give me that!
Don't go yet! I am starving to death.{nl}The meat you brought me came too late. What must I do?
Okay.. I think I can eat those Young Leaves.{nl}They're thin and wet... yes, they will be good!
My hunger doesn't go away even after eating a lot.{nl}It's actually getting worse, I might as well just die.
There must be something to eat around here..{nl}Please... get me something to eat.{nl}
I am so hungry yet something is echoing inside my head...{nl}The sound of a music box..  I can't eat an echo..
Ahh, my Liliya...{nl}I will never be able to see you again...
Please think of that necklace as the gift from Liliya and keep it safe.{nl}It carries a blessing from the Great Cathedral, so it will help you.

Wait, that music box.. What is it?{nl}

Damn. What was I doing?{nl}Ahah. Liliya... My Liliya!{nl}
We left for a pilgrimage to the Great Cathedral to receive the blessings of the goddesses to celebrate our wedding.{nl}But then, that evil Naktis... that unforgivable Demon Lord.{nl}
Stole her music box and necklace and gave them to the monsters and cursed her with gluttony.{nl}As if to laugh at Maven's lessons.
Wait. My head is shaking because of the curse. {nl}I still have a lot more to say... I don't know if I would be able to endure until then.
I heard the Asellus at the Hollow Tree Forest have purifying powers.{nl}I should be able to endure with its purification.
To completely remove the curse, you should go see the priests...{nl}I want to stay here and recollect Liliya a little more.
Thanks. Way better.{nl}My Liliya... my music box... She must not be in this world.{nl}
If you meet the servant of Naktis in any case, please get a revenge for her.{nl}The mark of our love which the demon possesses... Please receive it as a compensation for my gratitude.{nl}
This necklce will be very useful since it is blessed by the Great Cathedral. {nl}That necklace is meaningless to me.
You should not touch it.{nl}It will come soon... just wait little more.
Did you see that? That boy is my son, who left for the pilgrimage four years ago.{nl}I followed him to save him from the curse.
Thank you so much for your words.{nl}It will be good if you could defeat the monsters that are disturbing me.
There is a way to save my son.{nl}I believe that my devotion to this will reach him eventually.
Well done. {nl}I won't be scared of anything from now on, because of you.
If the amount of Food Scraps that I gave to you is not enough, go to Isblyskes Square.{nl}I have mixed divine water into the food there.
The food that was stolen by my son is mixed with the divine water. {nl}As time passes by, he will throw up all the energy of the curse.{nl}
To be honest with you, I don't know if I will be able to save my son with this.{nl} I need hope, I mean... I need some reliable results.
When you throw these Food Scraps to the monsters, some of them might eat the food.{nl}If you attack them a lot afterwards, they will throw up. Bring me what they throw up.{nl}
If there are not enough Food Scraps, you can get some more at Isblyskes Square.
The Condensed Cursed Energy. It indeed worked. {nl}Now I should just wait for my son to throw up.{nl}Thank you so much. May the blessings of the goddesses be with you always...{nl}{nl}

While my brothers were on the their way to the pilgrimage, they all died due to the tricks from the demons.{nl}I feel sorry for my brothers who can't return to the godddesses.{nl}
I might be down a bit, but I want to help them somehow.{nl}Please. Please help me.
I was going to release the souls that were locked in this altar.{nl}But, it didn't work. Was there something wrong with my prayer?
I was broken off from the group due to my injury, but became sensitive to what lay ahead.{nl}After all, I saw a group of demons move on out.{nl}
That night... I hid behind the grass forest and had to look at everything. {nl}Everyone was pointing guns at each other. They were so close to each other...{nl}
And they were so absorbed with madness even after their death so they could not even return to the goddesses.{nl}That's why I wanted to give them the eternal sleep.{nl}
Maybe, everything so far was fated so that I would become a priest. Oh, goddesses...
I can't move with my legs like this.{nl}Why'd it have to be like this... The only one I can trust is you.
Before I left for my pilgrimage, I overheard the stories about the Revelators.{nl}And you are really special among them. Can you listen to me little more?
It was really horrible. Those brothers who used to be keen to each other hurt each other...{nl}And the demons cheated on those brothers who died.{nl}
Some of their souls were thrown to the monsters like toys.{nl}Those souls need to be laid to rest as well.
Can you first test this?{nl}I am making a reagent that will extract souls from monsters, but it's not working so well.{nl}
Test this on the monsters that shines with the light of the souls
Use anything you have, this method, that method, this ingredient and that ingredient.{nl}It should work well...
Ah, something must be lacking.{nl}Maybe the method is wrong too...
I remembered what's missing. A scripture!{nl}One of the souls that is locked in the nearby altar should have one.
Unfortunately, I lost my Scripture in the mess.{nl}If I had it, I would have remembered that right away.
This is it. Many mysteries are being solved because of you.{nl}Let's see, why don't we try a different method this time?
The spirits inside the monsters' stomach will shine when you use this medicine this time.{nl}When you defeat that monster, the spirits that were tied there will be freed.{nl}
My brothers are blaming each other and crying out in madness even after their death.{nl}At the altar of the goddesses.{nl}
Even a living being like myself could never forgive it, how would the souls feel?{nl}How could I let priests, those who should spread the love of the goddesses, do such a thing?
They will definitely thank you.{nl}I hope the blessing of the goddess lights your way.{nl}
This method will be effective for sure.{nl}It must be. If not...
Thank you so much for everything so far.{nl}Because of you, my brothers can rest in peace now.
Ah, not only my brothers are trapped here.{nl}When you see a soul that needs saving, please do not just leave it, but save it in the name of the goddess.
The demons were looking for this thing while teasing spirits.{nl}Maybe it has something to do with the Great Cathedral at the end of the Pilgrims' Way.{nl}
Ah, something came to mind now that you mention the Great Cathedral.{nl}I have this crafting recipe, but I have no idea how to use it.{nl}
But if there's anyone who could help all the spirits lay into eternal rest..{nl}It would be the owner of this land.{nl}
If it's you, then it won't be hard to find a way to save them.{nl}I will stay here and pray that the souls attain eternal rest.
There are many ways to send souls to eternal rest.{nl}
You may have to dedicate some flowers, or you may have to collect the scriptures of the pilgrims..{nl}You may have to suppress wrathful spirits with your power.
You helped the restrained spirits to sleep eternally?{nl}Oh my god.. This craft manual definitely belongs to you. {nl}
This artifact was left to me by my grandfather. He gave it to me because I had always dreamed to become a priest.{nl}This is meaningless to me now. I will create a commemoration for my colleagues here and live on.

I already knew that Pilgrim's Way was ruined with Naktis' curse.{nl}But I didn't know that even the sanctums were corrupted.. It's such a shame.
It would be the best if I do it myself, but I can't leave this place behind.{nl}I want you to purify the Sanctums with this divine water.{nl}
I heard the congregation sent the disciples, but I guess it didn't turn out right.{nl}I think the everything will be alright since you will do it. But I am still uneasy.
The statue of Goddess Vakarine at the Forest of Prayer...{nl}Naktis... How would have one ever known that she would ruin the teachings of Archbishop Maven.
In any case, we could at least do some emergency procedures.{nl}Collect Grey Gypsum Fragments and repair it with dewdrops that are endowed with the blessings of the morning star.
I hope the goddesses protect you.{nl}Not only the statues of the goddesses, but the sanctums also would have many problems.
By 'corrupted sanctums', you mean the Forest of Prayer, right?{nl}I thought I had prepared a lot for that, but I guess Naktis' curse was even stronger.
I hid my Symbol of Faith in the sanctums to prepare for times like this.{nl}That symbol enables you to find the monsters who have swallowed the badges of the sanctum.{nl}
Find the badges of the sanctum and burn them in front of the sanctum.{nl}It may not return to how it used to be, but you will be able to purify it a bit.
The blessing that cleanses evil energy.{nl}Oh, goddesses, bless us with purified water.
A floral tribute to the goddesses.{nl}The pleasure and joy of collecting flowers.
I was able to get one step closer to the goddesses due to my contribution.{nl}May the blessing be with you always.
You know that Pilgrim's Way holds the lessons of Maven right?{nl}To be able to cast a curse on humans as if they originally sinned... Naktis sure is formidable.
I feel hurt whenever I think about my son.{nl}I can't believe that my son who left for the pilgrimage to the Great Cathedral received the curse...
Hey.. Please wait. You will face great danger if you just go on like that.{nl}This place has a very dangerous curse cast upon it. {nl}
Ah, I just want to try some alchemy. I don't mean any harm. {nl}I will make some medicine for you, so you can consume it.{nl}
Okay then, I want you to find my bag... {nl}I am sorry. As you can see, I fell down while I was running away.
This place is crazy. {nl}This road is less like the road of the pilgrimage, and more like the road of the curses.
The stuff in my bag should be untouched, since none of it was edible. {nl}I will make the medicine soon.
Darn. I thought they were all okay, but one of the bottles is broken. We needed that.. {nl}Fortunately, the ingredients are near here, but its too dangerous. What should I do?
Apsimesti Crossroads is not a road for pilgrims anymore, due to those vicious demons.{nl}How would one have ever known that they would encounter such demons right before they arrived at the Great Cathedral?{nl}
After seeing my companion Witas fall under the curse of the demons, I ran away.{nl}As a result, I don't know about other curses, but I will be able to stop Witas' curse.
Go to the Sestines Wilderness and look for reeds with big leaves.{nl}Get the liquid essence from the monsters that reside in the reeds' roots.{nl}Remember to be careful...
I am not fully recovered yet... I am sorry that I can't go with you.
Ah, you did a good job. Please wait a moment.{nl}I am still hurt, but I think I can manage.{nl}
Here you go. It is now completed. {nl}
How about it? Can you feel it?{nl}The effect comes slowly so please be patient.
A refreshing feeling slowly came over me.
When the medicine starts to take effect, you will be able to endure against the demons' curses.{nl}But wait, I... I have a favor to ask. {nl}
Witas. My colleague who is cursed.{nl}I would do anything to restore him to his normal status.
Objects that are precious to Witas are here. {nl}If you find these and show them to him, I think he will regain his senses.{nl}
The things that he dropped while desperately following me are probably those objects...{nl}It was between the tombstone near Meeting Plaza and Klajone Access Road.
I remember he said that item was what his mother left to him before she died.{nl}I don't know a lot about it.
Who are you anyways? How come my curse didn't work?{nl}How come the power of seduction that the Succubus taught me didn't work on you?
That.. Give it to me, now!{nl}That's not an object that belongs to you!
What have I done?{nl}Ah, mother... what should I do with this sin...
Pond of Silence
(This stream needs to be purified.)
I've done the same thing as the people I used to hate would do.{nl}I am sorry. Had I thrown away my anger, I wouldn't have been trapped like this..{nl}
How could I do and say such things to your innocent being...{nl}Yes... Thanks for saving me. I am at peace now.
When I thought about the moment when this scripture had been ripped into pieces,{nl}I became so enraged that I ended up trapping myself here.{nl}But now I am able to rest because of you.{nl}
I really appreciate the effort you took, getting back this precious scripture. {nl}But, I'm no longer attached to it now. Goodbye...
I realized that all deaths of my colleagues were due to the revenge.{nl}I don't need it anymore... Thanks.
Who are you? Become the slave of the Succubus!
I can't say milk and honey flows in this land anymore.{nl}Should I give up on bee farming?
The bees have turned into violent monsters.{nl}I don't know how I can make a living from now on.
I don't remember what happened after I was casted with the curse.{nl}But, those demons, they definitely must be looking for something.{nl}
If you are going to the Great Cathedral, I want to stop you.{nl}The demon who casted the curse on this land went to the Great Cathedral.
I saw the true nature of the curse with my own eyes.{nl}That Succubus beside Naktis... Even I, who was silently watching, almost got seduced.
Even during Medzio Diena, this place was safe.{nl}I used to think disasters were somebody else's problem.
The bees are not the only ones that changed.{nl}The monsters that I saw for the first time in my life had overrun Siauliai Woods back then.
I've spent many years making mead, but I have to end now without any significant product.{nl}Who should I blame for this..
All other Revelators were wrong.{nl}But if it were you... I don't know.
The priests told us to wait, but the damage caused by the monsters was getting bad.{nl}I could not stand it anymore so I took action.
I will find out why the monsters are making a mess here.{nl}Then the priests will be speechless.
Maybe we touched something we shouldn't have touched.{nl}I think we did...
The priest is very angry.{nl}Damn, if only she told me more about the altar.
The villagers told us that they couldn't trust the priest anymore so they were taking action themselves.{nl}Me? I don't care, as long as the monsters get taken care of.
Where could Goddess Austeja have gone at a time like this?
I know that the priests are trying their best, but we should protect our village.{nl}We're having trouble living on due to those monsters, so we can't just do nothing.
The priests never told us what's wrong.{nl}We know that they are afraid that we might feel uneasy... But still we want to know.
I know this might come out wrong but, I only trust you alone, Revelator.{nl}I am sorry to the priests... and I am sorry to you, Revelator, for saying that.
So we created the incident.{nl}Our actions.. I am so sorry.{nl}
I'm scared Goddess Austeja won't come back to protect our village...{nl}But, I am even more scared of the monsters in front of my eyes.
I refuse to just wait around as the priests have said.{nl}I refuse to be driven around by those monsters anymore.
I don't want to doubt the goddesses.{nl}But the priests don't tell us anything.. Isn't that strange?
There's so much distrust between our priests and the villagers right now.{nl}I don't want to create a mess..{nl}
The only thing I could tell to the villagers who were wounded was to wait..{nl}Even if it was the monsters' doing. Reality is cruel.
A thorn forest... If it weren't for you, this place would have became just like that.{nl}I feel grateful to the villagers since I believe they guided you to me.
The seal here was able to be protected by you.{nl}But, I can't relax yet because the seal of Spring Light Wood is still left.
My sister Laima has told me about this in the past.{nl}The goddesses have a duty to save humans, but the humans also have a duty to save us.
Farmer Druva
I don't care about the monsters or the seals.{nl}Someone else getting hurt is their problem. We clear?
Times like this are an opportunity.{nl}Prices for agricultural products are increasing due to the monsters.
I was a refugee from the capital.{nl}I moved here hearing that this place was safe.. but that apparently is untrue. I'm ruined.
Ah, I am so hungry... I can't endure any longer.{nl}Hey. Is there something to eat?
I can't do anything since I am starving to death...
I came here to save my son who is cursed.{nl}If you see a young man who is about to starve to death, let me know.
I will return to my hometown with my son.{nl}Yes. The Revelator of the goddesses helped us.
I want to see my son being healthy again.{nl}It's too painful to wait until my son to throw up the vicious energy.
What should I do about it to save the spirits?
These are not Maven's teachings.{nl}They are just Naktis' curse.
There are four more necklaces besides this necklace, each with a teaching of Maven.{nl}They are all meaningless to me.
We all promised each other to become good priests.{nl}It feels like that moment was just the day before yesterday... Just a meaningless dream.
Witas really.. went back to the goddess.{nl}This is all the curse's doing, please don't feel guilty about it.{nl}
Ah, if you see the Tree of Faith, please restore it.{nl}I heard that tree blocks the curse's energy.
If it weren't for you, Maven's teachings would have been left cursed until the end.{nl}You saved this land. Witas' spirit as well.
I heard that all the necklaces of Maven can be combined together through a special method.{nl}I heard the crafting recipe is present somewhere, but I don't know where it is.
No... Not yet.
I've been waiting for you for hundreds of years.{nl}However, you are still weak. You must improve...
Priest Daram
I heard that a priest succeeded in removing the energy of the curse.{nl}But, her method only works on the curse of gluttony.
The special bishop is at the Great Cathedral.{nl}He died when he was young, but he still stays at the Great Cathedral because of his special mission.
I tried my best to hide Maven's secret, but..{nl}Naktis is also staying at the Great Cathedral too long.
Priest Goda
The Great Cathedral has collapsed, but it still keeps its beauty.{nl}Especially, the secrets of Archbishop Maven, they look amazing every time we see them.
Archbishop Maven contributed everything building this Great Cathedral.{nl}All that was collapsed on Medzio Diena... destiny is too harsh.
Farewell is short, but the relationship lasts long.{nl}Someday we will meet again by the goddess.
Priest Prosit
Do you think the Great Cathedral will return to its normal state one day?{nl}I mean at least before I close my eyes.
I want to tell them that we should retake the Great Cathedral.{nl}But, I know we are not ready yet...
Revelator. It has been long...{nl}I have waited hundreds of years to guide you.{nl}
Don't worry. We just have to complete a vessel for my Spirit.{nl}To start, please collect some Spirit Essence here.
It's simple.{nl}Just open the Spirit's Scripture in your inventory.
My body is rotten and has gone back to Zemyna.{nl}But, my spirit remained at the Great Cathedral and saw many things.{nl}
I still clearly remember.{nl}The Great Cathedral during its time of prosperity... many bishops... waves of pilgrimage...{nl}
It continued until the day that the Great Cathedral turned out like this, due to Medzio Diena, four years ago.{nl}I felt so miserable back then.
Bishop Aurelius
Maven was one of the greatest priests, yet he was also interested in machinery.{nl}I am sure that the demons, who only think about magical power, don't understand his machines.{nl}
The Platform of Benevolence is one of the machines Maven invented.{nl}Proceed through Arka Chapel and to the Reception Room to obtain the second key.
Sergeant Tadas
Arleruno controls this place directly.{nl}He is so busy so I don't know where he is right now.
Do you think we can get some if we catch those monsters?
In fact, that string is used for tieing the sacks of grains.{nl}It's so obvious why we tie the sacks.{nl}To prevent the things inside from falling out.
Good.{nl}Well done.{nl}We can tie up the sacks now.
Are you a beginner?{nl}Don't just look at like that. Please help us.{nl}I am putting the trashes into the sack, but we don't have enough strings.{nl}I need a firm string to tie it.
It doesn't look like a normal sack.
We've tied all sacks... We just have to throw them away.{nl}Ah... I am so lazy to do this now.{nl}I will do this later... Hey you.
Me? I am the sergent controlling many soldiers under Baron Allerno who is clever and wise.{nl}But since not many people come here, we are doing this kind of work.
Yes. I left the sack at that cliff.{nl}I want you to take care of that.{nl}You can either bury it under the ground or kick it out from the cliff.{nl}I have been doing that.
Why did you come again?{nl}Did something come out from the sack?
Jaunius
Where is this place anyways?{nl}Why me...{nl}Hey please save me.
Jaunius
I can't move my legs..{nl}Hey, I don't know who you are, but please get me the hardtack that I hid.
My nickname is Squirrel since I hide things well in various places.{nl}Anyways, I can request to you like this as a result.
I remember that I hid many things one by one in the grass.{nl}Ah... I have a headache...
What happened to the villagers...{nl}How come I was in this sack...
Ah, thank you!{nl}That's it! You already found three of them!
I was about to ask him something, but he just disappeared.
Stepas
I don't know who you are, but you came at the right time. The farmers here complain that their work is too hard.{nl}I am sharing this solution that I received from the baron to the farmers after diluting it.{nl}It's called Nutritious Tonic!
{nl}I should get some poison of Scorpio to dilute this solution.{nl}It's simple. Just extract the poison right before it dies.{nl}After extracting the poison from it, it will be neutralized and die.
As the baron ordered me, I am observing the farmers here,{nl}Actually, managing them.
Okay then, please get me the poison from it.{nl}This solution is too strong.{nl}And I also don't feel good about sharing it.
Do not repeatitively hit it even if it is unconcious.{nl}Just get closer to it slowly...{nl}Ah that's not it... just get close to it and talk to it.
Okay this is it.{nl}Just wait a minute.
Now we should share this with the farmers here.{nl}Especially, Dalius over there. He looks as though he is out of his energy these days.{nl}He's not doing his job and looks down..
You should take a leaf of sweet herb on your way.{nl}Even if you diluted it, it's too strong to be eaten alone.{nl}There are many sweet herbs around here so you won't have a trouble finding it.
I didn't miss anything.{nl}Please move fast.
Dalius
Who are you? and what's that?{nl}Stepas sent you?
He told me to take this?{nl}Nutritious tonic?{nl}I never expected this from him.
Ah, that...{nl}Maybe the medicine was too strong? or the poison of Scorpio got rotten.{nl}Well, don't think about it. You just continue on your way.
Ah, my heard. What is this.{nl}I feel bloated...{nl}I shouldn't have eaten the food he gave to me!
I don't know what this is all about.
Marius
I should bring him some food. He must be looking for a small plot of field where he could scatter the seeds across the bridge over there.{nl}Whenever I try to go there, the food gets rotten.{nl}Can you bring me some?
Come back whenever it gets rotten.{nl}But, since there are not many of them, please take care.{nl}I only have six left.
You came at the right time since I was hungry.{nl}Something strange has been keep delivered from the lower side so I was so heptic.{nl}I will be concious again if I eat that rice cake. Give to me fast.
Now it will be good if you bring that to Dalius
What are you doing? Move fast...
Well.{nl}I don't understand why the food gets rotten whenever I cross there.{nl}... Is it because of the smoke there?
{nl}How would I know about it. If you are going back to Marius, then get rid of those strange things.{nl}I can't do it because I am scared.
They can be removed if I rub them with my feet and hands right?
I will eat this rice cake well.
In fact, I suspected the smoke.{nl}But as a farmer, I didn't know about it.{nl}I was also scared of those guys who claim that it was made by those barons.
Okay. Farewell.
Baron Secretary Arunas
Hello. I am the secretary of the baron, Areluno, who is the owner of this place.{nl}The baron ordered me to do something, but it's hard.{nl}I am little tired as well..I feel tired whenever I come out to the land.{nl}Please help me.
Long time ago, this place was full of vitalities due to tennat farming, but since one day..{nl}Sorry, but I can't tell you anymore.
It's simple. Please investigate that place a bit, and make sure the crops are growing well.
Is the task that I requested to you not done yet?
Ah, is that so. They are really like that as the baron and Rimas told so.{nl}Thank you.
Then, we should remove that energy.{nl}I will give you some woods first so please make the magic circle using that woods on that place.{nl}Like me, you don't seem to have skill to create a magic circle.
{nl}I will give you this spell scroll. First make it by tieing it with woods and burn it.
I am counting on you.{nl}I think feel more tired due to the energy in this place..
Ah, I am tired..
Yes? The crops died?{nl}Was the spell too strong?{nl}Well, don't think about that too much. If you were able to remove the strage energy, it would be fine.
Wizard Rimas
Are you the Revelator?{nl}Please do not think about the machine behind me.{nl}Unless you help me with one of my tasks.
This machine is being used for an important task.{nl}It is related to the past that isn't that long ago.{nl}The portal that would bring the eternal life and the power that sustains the eternal life..
You can only minimize the strange energy surrounding this place by enhancing the seal magic circle.{nl}To do so, we need those empty bottles.{nl}Good luck.
Is everything going alright?
Very nice.{nl}The machine is going well for sure.{nl}Its all because of you.{nl}And that strange energy is influencing the growth of the crops here.
I activate the power generator using the fuel that we accumulated in that storage.{nl}That's why we needed more grains.
{nl}It is so fortunate that the farmers are helping us without resistance.{nl}..Anyways, recently that storage is being attacked by the monsters so we worry about it.{nl}I guess its not strange since the grains are piled up there.
I can only say that the power generator helps to keep the gate open which leads to an important place.{nl}
I don't know when those monsters appear again so I can't leave this place. I can't also let the baron do it.
It will be quite for some time. {nl} Thanks.
The storage door is locked.
Joana
What is that? Is that the head of the stone statue? Give it to me. I got something to check.
It is the upper body of something. Give it to me.
Is that the lower body of the stone statue..?{nl}Give it to me.
That looks like a wing.. Can you give it to me?
I have a headache..{nl}Why am I here..?{nl}Anyways, I will return.
Should I take some rest..
Tadas
Really? A person comes out from the sack?{nl}Why did he do that?{nl}Well. I don't know.
The baron, Areluno is the landlord of this land!
Sergeant Stepas
The farmers here are too lazy. {nl}If I was the landlord, I would have swept them all..
{nl}The baron is very kind.
Even if this place belongs to the baron, this place is too infertile and the monsters also took the seeds..{nl}So, can you retrieve the seeds that were taken by the monsters?{nl}I put them well in my pocket..
I need more seeds.. Can you get me some more?
I don't know who took it. We should catch them all.
I don't know anymore.{nl}If he could share me a small plot of field, that would be good.
Yes. That's right. Thanks.
Now we have some seeds. Thank you so much.
Ah, that's right.{nl}There are many ways to enhance the magic circle.{nl}It is always a problem that I can't go since I can't leave the baron and this magic power generator behind.
{nl}Okay. Take these and scatter them.{nl}This is one of the methods for the enhancement. I made it to prepare times like this.
Use the poison to enhance the magic circle?..{nl}I am not sure if its right, but let's try it anyways.
I've collected that poison from the monsters.{nl}The monsters are very vicious and hard.
Benius
There are Manticens which the baron takes care at the Mirukis farm.{nl}I was little bit worried that they only do what they want to do..{nl}Anyways, yesterday, I fed them. Little big one.{nl}Their habit is to eat something after hiding somewhere.
{nl}I will search here so could you please take a look at Vinai brewery?{nl}I will give you a lump of meat so use it as a bait.{nl}They always hide like that so I can't feed them on the right time.{nl}I wouldn't worry if there were only one or two of them..
Protect the things that are important to the baron?{nl}Hahat!
Ha, Where did they go..
Even if we miss one, no one would recognize.
Horacius
Revelator?{nl}We don't have enough workforce at the moment so could you please help us?{nl}We need to prepare many things to do a big task.
I don't know why, but, somehow I am the one who is leading.{nl}Its embarrassing.
Please get some wood sticks from the tree fence near here.{nl}I will make a round woodstick.{nl}Let's say.. it is some kind of tool.
Recycle the trees that were used in the fence.
Very well indeed!{nl}With this much, I think we have enough.
I even have a plan to put the stone in the middle of a leather string.{nl}More we have, we will be better off.{nl}I am sorry to you..{nl}In fact, we should take care of our job, but we are in a hurry.. I am sorry.
You should be busy with the task of revelation...
{nl}Well, I will explain it to you.{nl}To get a revenge on the source of the destruction and to find out the truth behind the everything that is happening here.{nl}Our objectives are those.
The monsters have something that looks like a hard core.{nl}That is harder than a stone so if one gets hit by that, its quite lethal.{nl}And I think it would be better to get those from the monsters instead of getting stones here where the stones are not hard enough.
We will take care of our own tasks
That's enough.{nl}Thank you so much.
We should accumulate the poison that we will put on the weapons.{nl}The battles will be effective as a result.
Our biggest weakness is that it's not certain.{nl}It seems that they are hiding something in the restricted area in the aqueduct bridge.{nl}He is a greedy oldman, so there must be something inside. I am sure of it.
Place the poisonous pots and lure the monsters near them.{nl}When you collect enough, please bring me those.
I am sorry that I had to make you do this kind of work.
Farming tools are used to plowing the fields so they can be also used in battles.{nl}But we would definitely need the help from the farmers..
Show the letter that I gave to you and if you successfully persuade them, you would be able to receive their farming tools.
I hope the farmers don't request something big..
You broought a lot!{nl}Thanks!
Tauras
You fight well when you are not in hunger.{nl}I am called Tauras and I am in charge of supplying the food.{nl}We don't have enough time so we need help from anyone.
{nl}Could.. you help me a bit?
Desire comes when you are not in hunger.{nl}You may think there's plenty of food since this place is farming area..{nl}But that's before the plundering took place.{nl}Farming is hard and I am always in hunger..
{nl}It is reasonable that we should prepare something like this.{nl}We will make it happen with Horacius.
Please get some dandelions there.{nl}Dandelions are thankful flowers.{nl}They can be used with grains to make soups and they can also be used in medicines.
We appreciate for your help.
Thanks. I feel so relieved.
Dried food is better to keep it for a long time.{nl}Especially, you will feel full when you consume only a little amount of beef jerky.{nl}That's why we are accumulating them a lot.
Since one day, lots of plunderings occurred in this place.{nl}The farmers starved to death..But one thing strange is that although some of them didn't die due to hunger, we kept hearing the reports about their disappearances.{nl}I personally think this has something to do with the baron.{nl}I want to find out about that. Even if I would have to use my force.{nl}Horacius was the one who agreed with my plan.
Obtain some meats from the monsters in this region and put them in the dryer.
The key to this plan is whether we would be able to get fresh meats from the monsters.{nl}They hardly give up..
Thanks!
The problem is that the food storage gets attacked by the monsters frequently.{nl}Please help me a bit.
The food storage should be somewhere.
I can relax for now, but I don't know when they would attack again..
Albina
Are you the Revelator?{nl}I listen to the stories even when I am here in this rural region.{nl}I am planning to restore the Tenants' Farm here.
{nl}It is crucial to avoid the eyes of the baron.{nl}It is my mission to eliminate the vicious marks that were put in various places.
I've been doing this job for a long time..{nl}And we have only 3 left.
Over the fence, there is an altar that the villagers used to do ritual ceremonies.{nl}But due to the strong monster that the baron left here, we can't do ritual ceremonies anymore.
I can only guess.{nl}I am sure that something serious is going on here.
Be careful.{nl}It is very vicious.{nl}I am keep trying, but I always failed.
Oh my god!{nl}Thank you so much!
The seal magic circle which was discoverd in the A area... We should eliminate it.{nl}This is the hard stone that we obtained from the monsters.{nl}If we throw this, we may able to break the field.{nl}
I am the one who should have finished this job..{nl}I am sorry that I passed this job to you...
Cheer up, Revelator!
Ohoh, you succeeded!{nl}Now this place is going back to its normal status.
There's a magic circle in this region as well.{nl}We should break that.{nl}But, the monsters are always disturbing us...
Just think that the monsters don't have brains.{nl}They are not on the baron side and they are also not on our side.{nl}They always cause troubles and they disturb our tasks.
I feel so relieved to see that you are so enthusiastic.
We are almost there! The moment of restoration!
There are lots of tasks to do for the restoration.
The pieces that you gave to me are not normal.{nl}These must be.. those barons must have manipulated something on this land and destructed them.{nl}You collected all these...
{nl}Can I trust you?{nl}Hmm, then...
I am collecting the clues here.{nl}I can't tell you in details, but I am preparing something big.{nl}We should have some reasons to persuade the farmers and the villagers to do that task.{nl}I am collecting those.
First, I should glue these pieces together. Can you get me some sticky fluid from the monsters?{nl}I will try to glue them with it.
{nl}I feel... I feel like ruining the divinity, but I have no choice since I am running out of the supplies.
We don't have enough sticky fluid.
Okay that would be enough. Give it to me.{nl}I will try to glue them together.
To prepare the big task that we will do in the near future, I am collecting the clues to persuade the farmers.{nl}I mean... since the baron is wrong, I am telling you to get a revenge on the plunderings and the cruelties.{nl}.. I will tell you that much.
I mean, we should take the monster to the magic circle down there.{nl}In order to succeed the experiment, it would be better to extract the half of the blood from it.{nl}And then make it react to the magic circle.
You are understanding correctly right?
Yes.{nl}It really was like that. Monsters fall into the eternal sleep.. dying..{nl}The monsters are dying due to the energy coming from there...
Jonaris
From the one day, the crops here do not grow anymore.{nl}Even after I scatter the seeds a lot.{nl}So I am thinking maybe the reason of it is related to the magic circle that was created by the fellows of the baron.{nl}Can you help me?
As you can see, this place is full of water.{nl}The place full of water means that this land is very fertile.{nl}But, you can see it right? The crops at some places are not growing.{nl}It's not that all the fields are like that.
When you see the place near the magic circle, you will see the monsters with flames on them.{nl}Long time ago, I was able to put the flames on some of them in order to eliminate the magic circle, but after that I was so busy here.{nl}When you go there and put them into the magic circle, the field will break.
Still not completed?
Wow amazing.{nl}Thanks!
But, the magic circles are still left.{nl}Is there some way we could borrow the mighty power of the goddesses...{nl}Only if there were the statues of the goddesses...
Starting from the one day, those barons' plunderings increased a lot and many magic circles were created a lot. Somehow, some of them were less shiny.{nl}Anyways, when you get near the bright ones, it will be hard to eliminate them since you may get hurt.{nl}Of course, the most difficult task is to avoid the eyes of the barons and continue to do this task.
{nl}I don't know exactly who you are, but you are the perfect candidate to help us since you are not well known here.
Yoana has it?{nl}If we put them in the magic circle, don't you think the field would break?
You came well at the right time. I tied them up with the sticky fluid.{nl}... As I expected. This is the statue of the goddess.{nl}You tied them up with the fluid from the monsters... I am so sorry...
{nl}You need this? Take it.
I am counting on you.
Really?{nl}My predictions are all correct.{nl}Thank you.
Cheer up.
Jugas
Master, have you seen my seed pocket that the monsters took away from me?{nl}I am begging you.. please find the seed pocket for me.
It's lacking.
Ah, thank you.
There is an unstable sealed magic circle down there. {nl}The baron told me that the seal which prevents the strange energy spurting out from the places nearby is not perfect yet so the energy is leaking out. However, the problem is that it doesn't look like that.{nl}It is suspicious.{nl}Now we have to tie up these pieces, so can you find more about the energy on behalf of me?
Hmm.. It is almost completed now.{nl}We have enough reasons.. the food, almost everything.{nl}Now, we just have one more to go...
My wish is not something big. We just want to live.{nl}Harvest for one year and stay full until the next harvest. {nl}We, farmers want only that.
{nl}If that one thing doesn't get accomplished, we have no choice, but to stand up.{nl}Against the source of the plunderings.{nl}Also if the process of the plunderings ruin the mighty power of the goddess, and the objective of the plunderings results from the greed of one person, we do have to get mad about it.
We do have to check whether the farmers would particpate.{nl}I will give you the sheet so please get their signatures on the sheet.{nl}Along with the date for the execution, this sheet confirms that we all act together for the same purpose.
{nl}How could I request this to you...{nl}I am so sorry. If this gets completed, we will do the rest ourselves.
This task will give you some trouble.{nl}The farmers are not that simple.
Completed!{nl}Now you go on your way!{nl}I can't leave the completion of the task to you. That's too much burden for you.{nl}Thank you so much!
To do a big task..{nl}We should accumulate some clues.
Ah, What should I do...
Leader Horacius
More we prepare, better off we are.
Now, leave the things to us here.{nl}Thank you so much for everything so far.
I mean the second secret. {nl}Unfortunately, it seems that Naktis' servants have taken the lead.{nl}
I am investigating on how to undo Naktis' curse here.{nl}For the sake of those who are suffering from the curse, can you get me samples of the demons?
Well darn. We should be experimenting, not imagining things.{nl}I am sorry, but could you get me samples of other demons?
How come the goddesses leave those filthy demons like that...{nl}Is this also what the goddesses want?
We should just finish it before it gets in the hands of Naktis.{nl}Defeat the demons and find the divine artifacts of the salvation.
We don't have much time left to stay in the Great Cathedral.{nl}In the meantime, we should find clues on how to release the curse.
We should find out how Naktis' curse influences the psychology of humans...{nl}It really is a tough nut to crack.
The Great Cathedral is like a repository of knowledge.{nl}If you find those documents, we will easily find a way how to face against Naktis.
If no one maintains it, even great architectural wonders collapse easily.{nl}
I knew that the Great Cathedral would still be standing, even on Medzio Diena.{nl}But, Naktis' attacks were not something that could be endured.
4 years have passed since the congregation ordered the evacuation...{nl}Everything about the Great Cathedral is meaningless now due to Naktis' curse.
Priest Ruodell
Hmm, I know it is an order from the congregation, but we should first retrieve the Great Cathedral...{nl}Then we would be able to get an answer for the curse as well.
I don't know if we will be able to find a way to release the curse if things continue like this.{nl}If I only had the power, I would have driven all demons out from the Great Cathedral.
Priest Yosana
The congregation told us that they will retake the Great Cathedral once Naktis' curse is resolved.{nl}It just isn't right to leave the Great Cathedral, which supported the goddesses, like this for four years.
We lost many documents in the Great Cathedral due to Naktis' servants.{nl}Whenever I think about it, I feel so bad that we lost them..{nl}Those documents were over a hundred years old...
Priest Alisha
Are the Thistles not ready yet?{nl}If they come late, the medicine will dry out.
Did you get them?{nl}Please give them to me. I will put them in the cauldron and boil them now.
Thank you so much!{nl}I need them as fresh and green as possible.
I think the medicine is ready now.{nl}Okay... how should I administer this...
Pilgrim Orville
Please help me.{nl}I ran away and got here by avoiding the monsters, but I can't find a friend of mine who came with me.
Please find my friend.{nl}I lived so hard until now, so I can't just die here.
Priest Roana
Thanks for helping us.{nl}The goddess help the ones who try their best, and I think it was you, the Revelator.
It is getting stronger.
So the true nature of the curse was Chapparition.{nl}I was busy with the curse of Naktis so I think its so fortunate.{nl}
Ah, can you send this report to Priest Aden if you get a chance to go back to the Main Chamber?{nl}
The revelation is being protected by the five keys of Maven.{nl}To get those keys, you must solve all the secrets.{nl}
Then I should go back to your small pocket for a minute.{nl}Do not trust anyone.
The goddess wants you and Hauberk to defeat the pawns of Blut so that the 1st zone gets released from the control of the demons.{nl}To do so, you should disturb the consciousness of the subordinates who try to free the Blut.{nl}Could you defeat the monsters at the gathering place of Rituala?
Blut's
They tried to break the loosened barriers and run away outside.{nl}Get some help from Hauberks if you can.
Well done. I feel that the barriers in this region are more enhanced now.
You have big ambition..{nl}I can feel the strong spirit in you,.
I am Demon Lord Hauberk. I will tell you the story that you may be interested in...{nl}About Vakarine, goddess of the Evening Star.. I will tell you where she is.{nl}You want to find Vakarine?
So you want to save the Goddesses? You made a clever decision.
Unlike the other guys, I can't possess your body.{nl}So please carry my pieces of the seal now and enter inside.{nl}I will guide you from there.
Blut are facing against Kupole Zydrone at Nuzikalti Hall.{nl}Zydrone would try his best to resist, but I can't keep them anymore with our power only.
The only way to weaken Blut is to get the secreting glands that Blut shared with his subordinates and weaken his influence.{nl}There are Blut's guys near Bjaurer Hideout. Get the secreting glands of Blut from them.
The goddess is facing against the Demon Lord somewhere in the prison.{nl}She desperately needs help from you and Hauberk.
Good. I will eliminate this from this world.{nl}Blut would feel like as if he lost it's feelers.{nl}It will be a big help to Zydrone.
The battle with Blut will be hard for us.{nl}Hauberk should help us. We should grant the substance to Hauberk again.
{nl}Blut sealed his power at his altar for his escape.{nl}If Hauberk could absorb that, it will be a great help to us.{nl}Go to the concentrated area. Control the altar there.
{nl}If you succeed on granting substance to Hauberk, please go see Zydrone.{nl}We are really running out of time now.
The power of the demons reject the power of the goddesses. Only Hauberk can do this.
Were you able to grant the substance to Hauberk? It is so fortunate.{nl}Everything will go as the goddess wishes...
I locked Blut in the barrier of the prison, but it won't stand long.{nl}When we are prepared, we should defeat it with Hauberk.{nl}If we lose, Vakarine would also fall down.
Go to the 2nd area of the prison. Norgaile is waitng for you and Hauberk there.
Blut and his followers want to escape to the external world. Can you defeat them?
The power of the Goddesses should control here again...
Well done. Now I am relieved.
The investigation team formed by humans came here lately.{nl}However, they could not get out and died here.{nl}The demons carry their belongings like their booties.
{nl}If you could retrieve them, I will hand them over to their families when this place becomes stabilized.
No humans can come to this place.
Thanks. I hope there are no more sacrifices like this...
It's hasn't been that long when the subordinates of Nuaele started to encroach this place.{nl}But, because of some guy who planned this meticulously, the barriers of the Goddesses are collapsing from all over the places.
{nl}In order to destroy the power of Nuaele here, we should eliminate his subordinates.{nl}At the 1st isolated zone, there's some guy who is waiting for Nuaele to defeat Kupole Aldona.{nl}Please defeat them.
I am worried about Aldona at Nuaele's place...
Even if we fail to defeat Nuaele, we reduced the number of his followers who would listen to his orders so I think it would be safe for some time..
All demons here were the followers of Hauberk at this place.{nl}Hauberk knows well about that. {nl}Hauberk was granted with the substance, but I am sure he is still unstable.
Hauberk wants to retrieve his manes that he shared with the demons.{nl}Please make Hauberk more stronger. He must also want that.{nl}Please go to the 2nd isolated zone.
Long time ago, when Helgasercle was ripped in pieces and sealed, his followers also were kicked out from the demon realms.{nl}The demons who lost their owner started to trample upon humans and the Goddesses locked them up here.
{nl}Ferocious Nuaele has the seal pieces of Hauberk.{nl}They are following Nuaele as if he is Hauberk.{nl}If you retrieve the manes of Hauberk and give them back to Hauberk, they won't at least follow Nuaele.
Before Hauberk's seal pieces return to Hauberk, I expect the demons would be in confusion for a while.{nl}Hauberk must regain his power.
Nuaele had many chances to use the accumulated power to go out into the world by breaking into the weakened power of the Goddesses.{nl}But, he is waiting something. We don't know what he is waiting for.{nl}We should interrogate the subordinates of Nuaele to find out what that is.
{nl}I will give you this marble that I received from the Goddesses.{nl}Kupoles can't use this anymore since the control of the Goddesses in the prison became weak.{nl}But since Hauberk helps you, you will be able to read the minds of the demons.
When the power of the goddesses get weak, the power of us, Kupoles also get weak.
They were thinking of making the demon prison into their demon realm from the first place.{nl}If this place falls into the hands of him, even Ausrine won't be able to do anything.{nl}You just told me an important information. Thank you.
There's *monster at the 4th isolated area. Hauberk used to trust him the most, but as Hauberk was sealed, he went to Nuaele's side.{nl}If you could defeat him, then its like you are eliminating one of strongest weapons of Nuaele.
Hauberk would welcome this. We don't need that kind of subordinates anymore.
When Hauberk was sealed by Helgasercle, the demons thought that no one like Hauberk would appear again.{nl}But, Nuaele is acting like Hauberk and he became the most threatening Demon Lord.
What did Hauberk tell you? It's good for all of us.
After Nuaele disappeared, among the demons that were being controlled by Nuaele, there are some demons that want to expand their influences.{nl}Please destroy the demon monster at the 1st isolated area.
Hauberk and Nuaele will become symbolic figures to the demons.
Because of you, this place was able to be stabilized a lot.
Many sisters who fought against Monster * at the 4th isolated area were killed a lot.{nl}The demons stole the necklaces from them and collecting them as if they are medals.{nl}Please help us so that those demons would not underestimate us again.
Many sisters are being sacrificed even at this moment at other prisons where your help can not reach.{nl}Please help us. Revelator...
I will pass these necklaces to Vakarine when this place gets okay.{nl}I hope the goddesses always protect you...
Nuaele is planning something.{nl}Please go see Aldona. He will take you to Nuaele's area.
We don't have enough time to catch him and ask what he is planning!
I can feel that Nuaele has disappeared.{nl}Please go to the District 3.{nl}Vakarine is waiting for your help.
Because of you, Zydrone and Aldona were able to help me.{nl}Thank you, Revelator and Hauberk.
{nl}I will restore my Dionys to its previous status now.{nl}Meet Zydrone. Please help her to complete my key.
The goddess is trying to calm down the violent Dionys and trying to help her to come back to her previous status.{nl}To do so, we should accumulate the power of the goddess that are scattered across this area.{nl}We can collect that power using the Evening Star Key. But we will definitely need your help.
Due to the space that was created near the Oruarma Cathedral, the place where the key should be recharged, it's pretty hard to do the ritual normally. {nl}Deactivate the space at the scar of transformation.
Dionys was family of the goddess and her companion.{nl}The goddess became very sad after sacrificing Dionys to seal him up with the chains.
We can start the ritual again. When the Evening Star Key gets completed, we would be able to restore Dionys who became violent to her normal status.
Let's go to Oruarma Cathedral. As I am recharging this key, you should protect me.
{nl}Are you ready?
Please bring this key to Aldona.{nl}On behalf of the tired goddesses, Aldona is preventing the escape of Dionys.{nl}Please hurry.
We can't stand anymore. Dionys can't be faced by the Kupoles.{nl}You and Hauberk should help. And one more thing...{nl}You should unleash the power of the seal that the goddess has prepared for the worst moment.
Please unseal the Rearda, Kasa and Rada Seals that are near the magic suppressor using the Evening Star Key that you received from Zydrone.{nl}You will have easier time facing against Dionys.
The goddess prepared for the everything that could occur.{nl}The problem is time. If we arrive late, then even Vakarine won't be able to do anything.
As the seal unleashes, the lights of the goddess are coming to the magic suppressor.{nl}Now, everything is ready. We also have enough time.
I will persuade Dionys first, but it won't be effective.{nl}Dionys has the chains that Giltine had created.{nl}That's why she is breaking everything she sees.
If we fail, Dionys will escape from this place.{nl}It will be the same thing as unleashing tens of Demon Lords to this world.{nl}Tell me when you are ready.
We just ran into a problem. The reason why the goddess helped Hauberk to regain his energy was because Hauberk is the key who can quiet down this mess.{nl}The goddess tried to close the space that was opened from the demon realm using the chains and the spirits of Hauberk.
I am sorry to deceive you. But, I can't tell you the truth as long as Hauberk is with you.{nl}Hauberk ran away to District 4. Please tell this to the Goddess as quickly as possible.
Alright... so that's why.{nl}Do not lose your hope savior, it's not too late as long as you are alive.{nl}Hauberk ran away to District 4 which is like a mae in this prison.
Look for Daiva there. She will guide you to Hauberk.{nl}I will observe Dionys from here.{nl}If you or the Kupoles seal Hauberk, we will meet again at the District 5.
The dimensional door that was opened from the demon realm. The dimensional crack can't be closed even by the goddess.{nl}We should control the dimensional crack using Hauberk and eliminate with the chains.{nl}But in that process, Hauberk was completely eliminated. Before he ran away like that, I had to lock him up...{nl}{nl}I am so sorry to see the goddess again.{nl}
As Baltrus disappeared, the demons were confused who used to receive orders from him.{nl}That caused the demons more violent whose behaviours were already unpredictable.{nl}Can you defeat those who are coming to Oruarma Cathedral?
Even if the goddess isn't here, the Kupoles won't be violent.{nl}We are the symbol of rules and disciplines.
The great hall is one of the places which the Goddesses could easily regain their energies.{nl}So it should be safe from the demons all the time.{nl}Thanks for taking care of that.
The demons that ran away after being attacked by Dionys are hiding near the Rearda Seal.{nl}The fragments of Dionys that are stuck on them
The toe nails of the spirits
Retrieve them.{nl}It will help the goddess to restore Dionys.
Dionys is not normal. {nl}The goddess rescued her when she was being persecuted by the demons and became the Dionys nowadays.{nl}She temporarily lost her consciousness due to the chains, but you should not suspect her belief.
Thanks. I will pass these toe nails to the Goddesses.
Dionys was trying to destroy Rada Seal before she was locked up inside the magic suppressor.{nl}Luckily, we were able to lock it before...{nl}At then, it released its power to various places.
Please collect the symbols of the stars that Dionys scattered near Rama seal.{nl}It will be a big help to the goddess who wants to restore Dionys to it's previous status.
The damages that were caused by Dionys were so great.{nl}Hundreds of demon prisoners were dead and the violent Baltrus ran away before the Kupoles locked up Dionys.{nl}There were more than tens of Kupoles that were dead by the toe nails of Dionys at then.
Thank you. I will try my best to restore Dionys.
I've been wating for you. Hauberk is near here.{nl}He is trying to escape from Nebilau by attacking the barriers of the goddess.{nl}I hope you resist him.
Now is the only chance to restore everything back to its previous status.{nl}Please catch him.
You should chase him til the end to catch him.{nl}And even a slightest energy should be left in him so that he could share it with his subordinates.{nl}The goddess wants Hauberk in perfect shape.
Hauberk is recruiting his subordinates and allocating them here again.{nl}The guys who were roaming around the various places in the prison are coming to Hauberk again.{nl}Hauberk is sharing the pieces of his spirit to his subordinates to deceive our eyes while he is running away.
Even one piece is important to us since Hauberk should be in perfect shape.{nl}Defeat the servants of Hauberk at the inner isolated area and collect the pieces of Hauberk's spirit.
When we catch Hauberk, we will give him the pieces of his spirit back to him which he shared with his subordinates.{nl}You should not let Hauberk run away from this place.
He shared many pieces of his spirit more than we thought.{nl}Maybe, he is trying to eliminate the power of the key from him.{nl}We should prevent him from sharing more pieces!
We found the location of the place where Hauberk ran away.{nl}Let's meet at the entrance of the poison room.
Hauberk found another space in the poison room.{nl}They are trying to deceive our eyes by being possessed to his subordinates.{nl}Take this Night Star Spectral Orb.
When you use the Night Star Spectral Orb, you would be able to find{nl}Hauberk that is hiding at the poison room of Idunga.{nl}Defeat the demons until he gives up.
If Hauberk gives up and tries to run away, I will block him from this place.
You'be succeded driving Hauberk in.{nl}I will block here so that Hauberk would never return again.{nl}Chase after Hauberk.
If you drive Hauberk into the Galutin Solitary Confinement, Sigita would help you there.
You've lured Hauberk into the Galutin Solitary Confinement.{nl}He will have a trouble escaping from that place.
I will block Hauberk's escape here.{nl}Sigita must be blocking from the other end.{nl}Go follow Hauberk. Don't let him escape!
The demons are all criminals after that day.
Everything is not working well as planned...
I don't have anything to talk with a weak person.{nl}Go back.
The person who committed a sin would pay for his sin.
Hauberk is protesting inside the Galutin Solitary Confinement.{nl}Suppress and seal him.
{nl}Tell me when you are ready to attack.
Something not according to plan occurred.
There were so many sacrifices. Everything that was caused by the dimensional crack is collapsing this place.
We've done it. Please go to the goddess in the District 5.{nl}We will send the sealed Hauberk to the goddess when we need it.
After catching Hauberk, his subordinates ran away to various places in the prison.{nl}If we relase them, we don't know what they will do later so we should find them and get rid of them.{nl}Could you defeat Hauberk's demons that ran away to Aklaga isolated place?
The influence that started to spread fom the capital city of the humans would disturb the control of Vakarine more and more.{nl}In order to prepare for that, we should get rid of the subordinates who used to follow the Demon Lord.
Thanks. I will stay here and chase after the rest of them.
Right before you succeeded on sealing Hauberk, some of the subordinates of Hauberk ran away to Ishidevi Hideout by disobeying the order of Hauberk.{nl}The conspiracy that Nuaele planned occurred because we failed to catch him before he ran away.
{nl}That should never occur again. Please get rid of the betrayers near Ishidevi Hideout.
I can't forget that my sisters were killed by Nuaele...
Well done. I will find those guys so that they can't resist against the goddess.{nl}Even if the goddess use all her powers, we will still defeat them so that they can't resist against us...
The goddess may not agree, but I want to get revenge.{nl}The influence of the disaster that occurred at the capital city of the humans is spreading quickly here.{nl}As the demons killed our sisters and took away their belongings, we also have to do the same thing.
{nl}Could you defeat the demons at the Hradeti Crossroads and collect the teeth of those demons?{nl}
This is cute compared to what they did.
Thanks. Please keep it secret to the goddess.
We could come this far because you helped us.{nl}If we could finish the job well, I think we will be able to protect the prison for a while.{nl}Are you ready to block the dimensional crack?
While I was away from this place, the dimensional crack became more stronger..{nl}If we move Hauberk in this situation, our seal would be unleashed and we will miss Hauberk.{nl}There's something that you should do it for me.
I don't feel good since I feel like I left a big burden on your shoulders.{nl}But, I can't help you if we can't finish this task.{nl}The power of the demons is lacking too much.
{nl}I will give you the Evening Star Rune. {nl}But, you should combine the runes with the traces of the metastasis that are on the demons that came here.{nl}Defeat the demons at the Aushura worship place.{nl}It will be an important medium to collect the power of the demons.
I should have listened to Laima's warnings from the beginning.
I've collected enough Evening Star Rune.{nl}I will use this to pull the spirits of demons.{nl}Receive the Evening Star Rune.
Use the Evening Star Rune to the demons and neutralize those demons.{nl}The demons that became neutralized would come to me.{nl}I will combine them with the spirits of Hauberk here.
The goddess and the demons can't control each other's spirits easily, but it is possible through the Revelator like you.
Thank you Revelator...{nl}The demons you've sent, the Kupoles are combining the with the spirit of Hauberk.
The demons are also gathered at Ishishula which is little bit far from here.{nl}Use the Evening Star Rune there and neutralize them.{nl}My Kupoles would go there and receive them..
Since you helped me, the influence of me and the Kupoles is recovering in the prison.{nl}We can go anywhere and we can appear from anywhere.{nl}And I am always looking at you. Be confident Revelator..
Due to your help, the Kupoles are combining with the spirits of Hauberk.{nl}We almost filled them...
There's a way to get more power of the demon spirits.{nl}Retrieve the symbols of the condemned criminals that we placed on them so that they can't use their power.{nl}Go to Etmesta isolated area and suppress the guys there. If you use the Evening Star Rune, you would be able to receive the symbol.
Me and the Kupoles could go anywhere in the prison, but I could not observe all of them besides.{nl}I engraved the symbol of the condemned criminal who committed most deadly sins so that they can't use their power.
With these symbols, we would be able to increase the size of Hauberk's spirits even more.
We collected enough power of the demon spirits to block the dimensional crack.{nl}As me and my Kupoles block the dimensional crack, you should protect us.
The root of the disaster that came to this place doesn't exist here anymore. You should receive the credit for this, Revelator.{nl}Now we will call Hauberk. And we will eliminate the dimensional crack here.
{nl}I am going to be here. If you need my help, come any time..
The demons hid into various places in the District 5 before I was able to fill the dimensional crack when I arrived here...{nl}And many of them are concentrated near Vanaga Monitor District, so please defeat them.
The number of Kupoles is increasing a lot..
If I disappear from this place a bit, this space would go wide again.{nl}I hope you find Laima fast...
Dionys is recovering fast due to you. Someday, she would protect us again near me...{nl}But she is suffering from the slow recovery while I am protecting this place.{nl}Can you defeat the demons that are at the Pasaru isolated place get me the empty spirits.
When Dionys gets recovered, you would be able to stabilize this prison without me.
Thanks. When Dionys comes back, it will be okay even if I leave this place for a while.
The small dimensional crack is widening at the areas where we can't reach.{nl}The Kupoles all went to different districts so I have no way to block the dimensional crack.{nl}Can you do it?
I'm in big debt to you, Zydrone and Aldona.
Thank you Revelator.
As Aldona ordered me, I've been wating for you.
Do you think the circumstances would be better if we were to receive Laima's warning little sooner from Vakarine?
You ended the lengthy battle...{nl}Aldona and Zydrone, I will send the Revelator so you guys should wait.
Please leave me alone...
The demon tricks are becoming more vicious.{nl}That demon is waiting for the next victim by hiding its evil energy.{nl}
It seems that Naktis has found out why we came to the Great Cathedral.{nl}Otherwise, there'd no reason for those demons to go after reports that should've been passed to Aden.
There are these orbs that keep spreading the curses.{nl}It's ineffective to destroy it. We can only stop the spreading of the curse through a holy ritual ceremony.{nl}
If you find an orb, please bring it to me.
It seems that they are spreading Naktis' thoughts...{nl}If we investigate it, we may be able to make use of this information.
It is made by an interesting principle.{nl}Anyways, thanks for your cooperation.{nl}
Ah, if you get a chance to go back to the Main Chamber...{nl}Could you pass this document to Priest Aden?
There once were always holy prayers echoing in this Great Cathedral.{nl}But, after Naktis' arrival, I've only seen unfaithful behavior.{nl}
My mission is to retrieve the sacred artifacts, but I can't stand and watch this anymore.{nl}Can you defeat the monsters that are roaming around the Great Cathedral?
Everyone is angry, but they are hold it in with their objectives in mind.{nl}But I.. just can't stand it...
There are many who trample on this sacred place.{nl}I can't forgive them.
I can still visualize those vicious beings.{nl}I will never forgive them in the name of the goddesses.
They should be ready to receive the punishment of the goddesses.{nl}Eternally.
I hope the goddesses always protect you.
There are a lot fewer demons, but there are still many of them.{nl}I can't forgive any of those demons.
If this Great Cathedral gets purified, all credits would go to you.{nl}But, we still have a long way to go.
The demons that are spreading the vicious curses are still roaming the Great Cathedral.{nl}As a priest under the goddesses' name, how can I just leave this be.
Priests always have patience and mercy in their minds when they train.{nl}But, their patience and mercy are not for the demons.
You've done well, but there are still many demons left.{nl}When this mission is over, I am planning to receive the mission of purification.
We have trouble. Hurry to Uola Chapel...{nl}I will tell you more when you get there.{nl}
Unfortunately, the bridge to it has collapsed so there's no direct path.{nl}There is no alternative besides the way around through the Penitence Route.{nl}Please hurry!
Cursed Pilgrim
I am so hungry even though I keep eating... Please get me some food...
Don't go without me... Please get me something to eat...
Oh goddess, so you are the one who saved me.{nl}I am sorry, but my body has not recovered yet...
I will take care of him by my side until he completely recovers from the curse.{nl}Maybe, I could also cure the other curses.
The curse of gluttony makes a person not to digest the food well.{nl}That's why the cursed people are always hungry. {nl}
After he recovers from the curse, he will be totally exhausted, so I will take care of him by my side.
Gytis
Revelator, we are in trouble. Please help us!{nl}As you can see, the workers are dying due to the poison of the monsters.
As Uska ordered, we were clearing the forest to grow some food until this incident occurred.{nl}The monsters here weren't that vicious before, but now they use poison...{nl}I don't know what happened to them...
The Pyromancer Master may help since she owes me something. {nl}Please. I am counting on you.
I know this well because I'm from this region.{nl}Even during Medzio Diena, the monsters here just ran away from people instead of using their poison.
But just now they attacked the workers with their poison.{nl}If we don't complete the farm, we'll have trouble supplying the city with food...
The monsters on that land?{nl}I can't believe it. I know it well since I used to go there a lot.
A Long time ago, I did a favor for the Pyromancer Master...{nl}She's the only one we can rely on now.
But if Gytis told you that, then I must say it's true.{nl}I do owe something to Gytis... Alright. Let's find a way together.
First, we should find out why the monsters became vicious.{nl}Go back to the land and get me samples of the monsters.
The Pyromancer Master told you that she would help?{nl}That's a relief.
The monsters became vicious and the poison..{nl}There are so many things these days that can't be trusted.
As expected, your skills match your reputation.{nl}Could you wait a sec? It shouldn't take that long to check.
I can feel the presence of a spell with a mysterious poison.{nl}I'm sure that its true nature lies somewhere on the land...
I can feel something horrible from these samples.{nl}Please be careful...
Leather and a dagger with a magic circle engraved on them.{nl}Unfortunately, these kind of objects are not my speciality so I don't know much about this.
From here on, it'll be better if we ask the Bokor Master.{nl}No one can compete with her in terms of spells.
You want to know what spell is cast upon these objects?{nl}Hmm. It is a very filthy spell.{nl}
I see. This spell spreads a poison that's pasted on the dagger to everything near it.
You will find the answer to the question when you ask the Bokor Master.{nl}I am sorry that I can't help you anymore.
However, I don't know what this poison is.{nl}But this dagger... How about you go meet the Ranger Master?
This dagger. Where is this from?{nl} You better tell me quick, before I lose my patience.
The Ranger Master studied daggers for some time in the past.{nl}That was due to Ebonypawn... She will give you the answer.
It was cast with a spell to spread poison on that land?{nl}Hmm. I've received help from an unexpected place.{nl}
Anyhow, this dagger belongs to Ebonypawn.{nl}You can tell by looking at the shape of the blade and the symbol. {nl}I can't detoxify it, but we've got some clues.
Don't worry about that. The Hunter Master knows a lot about poison.{nl}Like me, she is also after Ebonypawn, so she will definitely welcome you.
Can I help you with anything?{nl}So you want to know how to detoxify this poison...
He would dare come to Klaipeda...{nl}Ebonypawn. I won't let you slip away this time.
What happened to the Pyromancer's task?
So should I just report about the task to the Pyromancer Master?
Thanks for helping me.
I should reward you since you helped me.
These are the research documents. Tell Cryomancer Master that you would hand over the research documents on behalf of Gytis.
It is so fortunate that this resolved well enough.
These are the research documents that I asked from Gytis. I will use them well.
Please take it to him quickly.
I am feeling little better now.
Soldier Dennis
The deadline for the farm's construction is approaching,{nl} but the monsters have suddenly become vicious, so the workers can't even touch the site.
The other soldiers went to defeat Gorgon, and I can't leave this place.{nl}I can only trust you now for this. I am counting on you.
Really? Thanks..{nl}The location is the Joint Farmland. I am counting on you!
Do you think this makes any sense at all?{nl}Those monsters used to be scared of humans. Now they attack humans. With poison!
Sir Uska would have scolded me if it weren't for you... Thank you so much.{nl}Anyways, I wonder why the soldiers haven't returned yet?
Ah, this is troubling.{nl}I heard the monsters here are supposed to be innocuous, but they suddenly turned violent.
What the hell is the world coming to?{nl}...Now Alan, my colleague, is left protecting the entrance gate to the farm all by himself.
Can you really do that?{nl}Alright, please take care of Alan before the other soldiers return.
Soldier Alan
Don't come! Monsters are coming!{nl}Damn it, how will I be able to stand against this alone..
It's so fortunate that you are here.{nl}How come I can't hear anything from the soldiers who went to defeat Gorgon.
Was Alan okay?{nl}It's so fortunate that you're here, otherwise the whole district would've been swept away.
So you are the Revelator that I've heard rumors of. Thank you so much.{nl}I don't know why those monsters turned out like that.
Louise
I received the farm land from Gytis, but it's such a mess.{nl}Especially Ridimed. But, what can I do with my hands that only touched hoes before.
Just as I ran into trouble, I'm so lucky to have met the goddesses' helper.{nl}I am counting on you. It's already too late to manage the crops though.
You really drove the annoying Ridimeds away?{nl}That's such good news.
It's so good to hear that you drove the Ridimeds away.{nl}Now let's see what we can do next.{nl}
I think it would be helpful if I at least had a fence.{nl}Can you help me a little more?
There's a lot of wood from the trees that have been cut down at the cultivation area.{nl}If you could bring me some, we could make a fence.
Among the farms that were damaged on Medzio Diena, there are many that can't be recovered at the moment.{nl}They are either corrupted by evil energies or have too many monsters in them.{nl}
So Uska planned to make farmland by cultivating this forest.{nl}The restoration is important right now, but we can't do anything if we can't even obtain food supplies.{nl}
If the monsters were harmless, I would have done it myself.{nl}Heck, we wouldn't have to make the fence in the first place.
Fortunately the wood isn't corrupted.{nl}Please wait a bit. I will make the fence quickly.
That scarecrow should scare the monsters, but it's too small.{nl}We should make the scarecrow look bigger. Using the monsters' fluffy hair might do the trick.
The scarecrow should be bigger than humans.{nl}I will make the scarecrow bigger using the hair of the monsters.
Good. Now we are ready to set the fence.{nl}There are still a lot of monsters, so I hope you can help me to do this.
I was worried about the monsters, but now I am also worried about not having enough crops.{nl}Strangely, they don't grow anymore.
I really appreciate you making the fence.{nl}It will help the citizens of Klaipeda.
Researcher Gareth
The crops are growing too slowly.{nl}If we don't solve this, we may miss the harvest season.. Could you help me?
As Uska ordered, Gytis is leading the construction.{nl}Instead of attempting to restore the farms that were corrupted on Medzio Diena, they want to cultivate the forest.{nl}
Originally, the farmland belonged to the city, so the owner of the farm never came.{nl}But due to the food problem, they made the farm entirely in the name of the city.
First, could you get me samples of the Sakmolis?{nl}That monster is a plant-type, so it must have been influenced just like the crops were.
This is our last chance.{nl}If we don't find out why the crops grow so slowly, we may have to give up on this place.
So you've got them.{nl}Please wait a bit. I'll get the results soon.
So the monster suppressor was the problem.{nl}We were trying to prevent the number of monsters from increasing, but we almost ruined the crops as well.
First, please retrieve the Monster Suppressor.{nl}If we had a weaker device we would switch to it, but we can't do anything about that right now.
These were made for plant-type monsters so they would definitely influence the crops too.{nl}It was my fault for overlooking that possibility.
If it weren't for you, the harvest could've been spoiled and all that effort would've been wasted.{nl}Everything should grow well now, right?
They're late. My colleagues went to the Ishigiti Herb Farm to defeat the Gorgon.{nl}I don't wanna think that they were annihilated.
Soldier Peirce
Run! Gorgon is coming!
I hope I'm wrong.{nl}The monsters are going crazy...
You defeated the Gorgon yourself?{nl}It is fortunate that my colleagues are safe, but I don't know what they did as soldiers..{nl}
I will report to Sir Uska that you saved this farm.{nl}Thank you so much!
Help me! The Gorgon is chasing after us!
The person who is leading the mission at Dvasia Peak is Julian.{nl}Julian will really welcome me.
Thanks for your words.{nl}But it would be better to support Julian's squad at Dvasia Peak instead of this place.{nl}
I heard that the hardness and the elasticity of the wood sticks of Firent at Nepritas Cliffs is good.{nl}You can get the rope that was made from tieing those sticks from Red Pantos with spears. Please get me those first.
At first, they were gathered to Uskis Arable Land and Spring Light Wood.{nl}But, not after a long time, they came to this place.{nl}They must be going after the honey.
You're the most trustworthy Revelator I've ever met.{nl}If it's okay with you, could you look for a person named Maras at Vilna Forest up north?
If you find something like this again, please hand it over to Lamar near the Wood Watch Tower.{nl}I.. really don't know anything about those.
You've gathered a lot.{nl}I think this will be enough.
Since the seal towers here were damaged more seriously than the one at Uskis Arable Land,{nl}the evil energy here flows stronger.{nl}
There is one thing I am worried about..{nl}That symbol was once damaged so it may not restore the seal perfectly.{nl}
I believe that the goddesses will protect us.{nl}But, we must also do our best to repair the seal.
I heard about the thorny forest before.{nl}That place was once a normal forest, right? What do we do if our village turns out like that?
I can't just endure the monsters' violence anymore.{nl}We have to protect the village from now on instead of only relying on the priests.
This isn't all happening because Goddess Austeja is absent, right?{nl}If it's true though, what should I do now?
I will give you this scroll of purification, use this on the demons and then defeat them.{nl}The demons' fluids will become a solvent purified with the holy energy of the Great Cathedral.
You were able to avoid the curse, but you could not get away from the monsters.{nl}Maybe it was wrong to come here to do the pilgrimage.
You will pay for your intent of obtaining the revelation.{nl}Of course, you should obtain the fourth key of Maven as well.
Finally, the last key.{nl}I've been waiting for this moment for hundreds of years..{nl}A sentiment that is neither joy nor emptiness fills my heart.{nl}
The last secret is in the Small Reception Room.{nl}You should remember the order of the candles and their number.
Maven's Message
I am glad that my life's masterpiece has protected the revelation well.{nl}But, yours and my mission is not over yet.{nl}
Savior. Please open the door to Pasala Altar.{nl}If you really wish to obtain the revelation of the goddess, you will receive it at the end...
My guidance ends here.{nl}It has been very fortunate that I was able to guide you well...{nl}
I am going back to the goddesses.{nl}Please... save the kingdom and the goddesses.
Let's extract the curse's energy from the Penitence Route and make it appear.{nl}While I am concentrating, please activate all the Altars of Purification.{nl}{nl}
The curse of Naktis makes people suffer just by looking at it.{nl}It makes people miserable.
We have no other choice, but to find the solutions for each curse.{nl}It's like there are different treatments to different diseases.
I want to go back to my hometown.{nl}Demons, the curse... I am tired of everything now.
When the next priest comes, I am planning to return to my hometown with them.{nl}It will be really good if I could return home while I am alive.
Naktis' curse isn't the only one in this world.{nl}The famous city of Roxona is still effectively under the curse of petrification even though hundreds of years has passed.
The documents that are normal must still be present in the deeper side of the Great Cathedral...{nl}I am so sad that I wasn't able to see those.
I would say that was the wisdom of Maven.{nl}Maven thought that the Great Cathedral would not be normal all the time.{nl}
So if we could just recharge the magical power, any kinds of magics will be okay.{nl}Even if that's a magical power from the demons.
Go to Karuna Altar when you've recharged the Holy Symbol of Spiritual Power.{nl}The third key is waiting for you.
If you think you are ready, I will show you the true nature of the curse.{nl}If you can't eliminate it at once, it will make a bigger trouble.
Now all that's left is the Verification Test.{nl}The scripture that possesses my spirit, please open it in front of the altar of the revelation.
The Scriptural Relics contained the words of the great bishops...{nl}I am so infuriated that they are placed now in the wake of filthy demons.
Fortunately, most of the holy relics seem okay.{nl}If I had a little more power, I would have purified the demons in the name of the goddesses right away.
To prepare for times like this, I've brought an orb that can detect holy energy.{nl}Keep an eye on the demons though. You may be in for some trouble,{nl}since they will run towards the relics as soon as they see them.
We were sent from the congregation to investigate Naktis' curse.{nl}We should first find the documents that were scattered here, but those demons are a problem.
The lost documents all contain important content.{nl}I want to bring all of them, but we should first remove the curse.
This is a big help.{nl}When I treat the people who are cursed, I will tell them your name.
I made a stupid mistake.{nl}I lost my concentration for a moment and lost the report that I should've sent to Aden.
I have been looking around, but I think the demons may have played a part in this.{nl}If it's alright with you, could you help me look for the report?
Ah! This is it.{nl}If you get a chance to go to the Main Chamber, please hand it over to Aden.
We will need a lot of solvent in order to make the reagent that removes Naktis' curse.{nl}But, as you can see, we can't get the solvent at the moment.
But, there is still a way.{nl}If you could help me.
I was confident in making reagents so I thought I would be successful.{nl}I think I overestimated myself.
Thanks.{nl}The purity is a little lacking... but, if we refine it one more time, it will be useful.{nl}
You are late. Maven's secret here is already being attacked.{nl}If we lose the Holy Symbol of Spiritual Power, we will never be able to get the third key.
I regret that I could not do anything.{nl}We should get the Holy Symbol of Spiritual Power fast.
It is very fortunate that the Holy Symbol of Spiritual Power is alright. {nl}However, I can't seem to sense its magical power anymore, likely due to the long passage of time.
Defeat the demons nearby using the Holy Symbol of Spiritual Power.{nl}This will collect the magical power that is needed to obtain the third key.
To remove Naktis' curse, I am making a reagent which resists against evil energy. {nl}But, it's hard to guarantee its effects right now.{nl}
If you are okay, can you check the effects of the medicine?{nl}Ah, I don't mean to try it yourself. I am telling you to try on the demons.
This reagent pulls out evil energy from the body.{nl}But, it could cause internal injuries.
It's either ineffective or... actually it seems okay.{nl}It even explodes?{nl}Then we should work on it little more.
The number of Maven's keys that remain now are two.{nl}The secret for one of those keys cannot be solved right now, with the condition of the Cathedral as it is.{nl}
We have only one method... using the demons.{nl}I will tell you about the plan later, there are some things to find first.
There are documents here that describe a method of disguising as a demon in this Sanctuary.{nl} Through this method, you should be able to get the next key without shedding a drop of blood.
You found it. Now let me see.{nl}Where was the clause..
Ah. The method is rather simple. But you may have to put in some effort.{nl}First, get some articles of clothing from Naktis' servants.
Using the demons... The goddesses may turn their heads away,{nl}but if this is the best method, I will do it.
That will be enough.{nl}Now use the apparel to complete the scroll.
In this recipe, it says that you can complete the Demon Transformation Scroll at the Altar of Intelligence.{nl}Fortunately, the Altar of Intelligence is at Laukimas Antenave.{nl}
That's the passion of the priests who tried to protect the kingdom from the forces of evil. {nl}It continued on for hundreds of years until today.{nl}
So the demons went to Apgaule Altar without any complaints?{nl}Now then, it is time we follow them.
I am making the medicine quickly to heal one of the pilgrims who is cursed.{nl}I am almost finished, but it's so hard to get the thistle.{nl}
By itself, the medicine tries to push out the evil energy, so he won't consume it easily.{nl}I am thinking about putting the medicine in meat. Could you help me?
I hope this method is effective.{nl}It will save a lot of people.
The smell is strong enough so you should be able to deceive him.{nl}Please wait a minute. I will put the medicine into the meat.
Any meat will be okay. Even the meat from the monsters nearby.{nl}Okay then, I am counting on you.
It's completed.{nl}The medicine should work well.. Can you pass this meat to the pilgrim down there?{nl}{nl}You should continue to feed him until he is satisfied.{nl}I mean all the meats you've obtained. 20 lumps in total right?
So the pilgrim ate the meat?{nl}Ah... still not well yet?
So the medicine worked well?{nl}Really... that is so fortunate. Thanks for helping me.{nl}I will tell the other priests about this recipe.
I can sense another kind of curse. This curse is different from Naktis' curse.{nl}The true origin of it should be present somewhere, but it's hard for me to find it alone.{nl}{nl}
We've found it!{nl}Now we will eliminate the true origin.
My friend looks strange. {nl}He is not breathing and his face looks pale. His heart also doesn't beat anymore.{nl}Did he already leave for the goddesses? Dallas, please open your eyes..
Thank you so much. {nl}Dallas would also speak of you to the goddesses.
I am going to go to bury Dallas.{nl}Can you be with me until the end?
So you are safe.{nl}I am going to go back to my hometown with Dallas' belongings.{nl}
Are the peaceful days going to return like the old times?{nl}Revelator...
Revelator. I want to bury Dallas under the Taika Cliff where he can see his hometown.{nl}But there are so many monsters there. Please get rid of them.
First, it would be better to find some documents at the Sanctuary.{nl}I remember there are documents there about methods of disguising as demons.
Okay. Use the scroll to lure the demons to the Apgaule Altar.{nl}If you want to know what will happen... Well, you'll have to wait and see.
There is a dangerous demon luring priests and leading them to their deaths.{nl}It disguises itself to look like a secret of Maven.{nl}
The location is Maskuote Narthex.{nl}Please relieve our priests of this threat so they can concentrate on their mission.
I will submit a report as soon as I return to the congregation.{nl}This should soothe the priests who were in despair. Thanks.{nl}
And so all five keys are now collected.{nl}Go to Pasala Altar. The secret there will lead you to the hidden room.
Are you the Revelator of the goddesses or the one who belongs to the mighty power of the darkness?{nl}The evil darkness can not cross here.{nl}
You've proven that you are the Revelator of the goddesses.{nl}You may enter the room where the revelation is located.
It's so brutal. {nl}Our Great Cathedral, to those demons...
Druid Ellie
Hello. This is the garden of Ginaga.{nl}This place is the hometown and the land of Druid Master, Gina Greene.{nl}The master welcomes all people who visit this land.
You must have traveled various places in the kingdom.{nl}I am sorry, but do you know anything about the mysterious girl?{nl}
The girl left these trees before Medzio Diena.{nl}My master asked me to find about the trees, but I knew nothing about them...{nl}I want to get help from you.
We should find out if they just imply some kind of a symbol or they are endowed with some kind of power.{nl}Please first collect the leaves of Ellum at the neglected grape fields.
This girl had a mysterious energy.{nl}A long time ago, she traveled across the kingdom and left many forecasts and miracles.{nl}
Recently, we saw a similar looking girl at the Crystal Mine. {nl}But, strangely, she wasn't able to say anything.
Ellums are the monsters that were created in mass after Medzio Diena.{nl}If the trees here are endowed with some kind of power, the leaves of Ellum should react to them.
This will be enough. {nl}Let me concentrate for a bit.
Revelator, this is amazing!{nl}When we endowed the power of the trees to the leaves of the monsters that you brought, they waned right away.
If that's the case... Please get me two lumps of sample soil corrupted with evil energy.{nl}I want to know more about the power of this tree.
Before, evil energy was purified by the power of humans.{nl}But, if the power of this tree is true... they will be purified by planting it at several places.
So you brought them.{nl}I just finished the preparation for the purification ritual.
I will see the responses of this sample like the leaves.{nl}I hope it goes well.. Please see it yourself Revelator!
Oh goddess, please look at this. The ritual was successful.{nl}The master would purify everything at once with trees like this one.
Until the master comes back, I am going to do some base work for the large scale purification.{nl}Can you collect the five bottles of Tanus fluids from the Kvie Farm Area?
Thanks for helping me.{nl}The girl who left this tree.. who was she I wonder?
This tree is so mysterious.{nl}It's like the Revelator brought the clues of purification.
You've done enough.{nl}I should tell the Druid Master that you've been a great help.{nl}
Ah, I have one last thing to request of you.
This is a box that we discovered that contains more of these trees.{nl}If you get a chance to go to Shaton Farm, please give it to Druid Martinek.
He likes to interfere with others' lives so he may be involved in some kind of matter.{nl}Maybe you should ask the people there about his whereabouts.
Farm Supervisor Dorn
This is the private land of Shaton. {nl}Even a Revelator should not interfere here.
Farmer Max
Wheat farming is possible here unlike Shaton Farm.{nl}We were able to harvest the last farming... but...{nl}I am worried about the next farming.
Farmer Darcy
Blast it. We might have to leave this place.{nl}We were able to harvest and live due to the care of Gina Greene, but it's too hard now.
Monsters are the bigger problem we have at the moment besides failing harvesting due to vicious energy.{nl}If you could move out the monsters, then we may be able to endure little more.
We may be able to stand until the harvest season.{nl}But, the land is getting more and more corrupted, so one day it may turn just like the thorn forest.
To receive unexpected help from you..{nl}You and the druids are all trying hard, so I can't just give up like this.
We were lucky though. Do you know the Druid Master?{nl}Gina Greene, the owner of this farm.{nl}
She lent me the land without asking for any consideration after I lost my hometown due to Medzio Diena.{nl}But, what should I do now. Harvesting is becoming ineffective, and the number of monsters is increasing.{nl}
I was so thankful until now, but I can't let the families starve..{nl}If the vicious energy of the garden does not get removed, we have no choice, but to leave.
Did you feel something strange while you were coming here?{nl}I mean the dandelions. They are big compared to the ones in other places.. and they are quite threatening.{nl}
We should pull them out while they are sprouts, otherwise they could cover the whole farm.{nl}But due to the monsters, we can't continue our work.
It may be a lethargic excuse.{nl}We lost our hometown and we can't even farm on the land that we hardly deserve.
I should help you somehow since you helped me a lot.{nl}I will pay attention from now on. I won't lose to those monsters.
Matilda, the young lady of the farm
This is my hometown that I returned after a long time and it has changed a lot.
Farmer Miren
I want the druids to drive the monsters out, but they're all focused on that tree.{nl}It's infuriating me. Who is that girl anyway? {nl}
Hey. You, Revelator. Please help me instead of just looking at me.{nl}I want you to drive out the monsters that are on my fields.
The girl the druids are talking about.{nl}I don't know about the tree, but I think it will bring disaster.{nl}
I can't farm due to the evil energy and also those monsters..{nl}I've been farming here for a long time, but ever since that girl came here and left, we've had only trouble.{nl}
I know that I've lived here for my whole life, but young people should not lie.{nl}Are you telling me the tree or the girl could be of help? That's nonsense.
Thanks, really.{nl}You are way better than those useless druids there.
I would have driven out all druids if it weren't Gina Greene.{nl}When I was running away from the monsters last time, they saved me, but they don't look after me after that.{nl}
Okay, good. Please find my bag.{nl}I was so busy then, I forgot everything about that bag.
There are many farmers here so there may be bags of other people here as well.{nl}There are name tags in the bags so please do not mix them up.
Where did I lose it?{nl}I fell down once somewhere..
Thank you so much for finding my bag. {nl}Now that I look at it, I can't blame the druids. They all have hard times right now.
Alchemist George
I came here to get the useful ingredients of alchemy, but I can't move my body..{nl}I have an important experiment soon, but there's no one who could help me.
Investigator Monahan
I came here from Klaipeda.{nl}To investigate the damage on the farms of this kingdom since Medzio Diena.{nl}
You must know that there isn't enough food in the kingdom.{nl}If you are okay, can you help me with my investigation?
That's so thankful.{nl}First, please get me the eggs of the monsters first. I have something to check.
There are places that need me so I feel very thankful. {nl}But, my stamina is not like before.
Well done.{nl}With this, we should be able to know how much evil energy has accumulated so far.
That's strange. I thought I should give up on this place, but some other energies are mixed together.{nl}To know this, we need something that received the energy of the ground strongly. Could you help me a bit?
Please take a look at the roots of grapevine closely at the Avarza Grape Farm.{nl}The other monsters' eggs must be adjacent to them. I want you to bring me about three of them.
Please be careful since you may get hurt when you touch the egg houses.{nl}It is a good habit to be always be careful.
Good. The sacred energy is slowly spreading in the ground.{nl}Since you helped me, we don't have to give up on this garden.{nl}
But, that energy is too weak and it is from the kind that I barely knows.{nl}Maybe the druids should know about it.
Shaton Family's Private Officer Hartman
I will help you so please move out before I scold you!
You can't enter here unless you have the permission.{nl}But, it may be possible.. You know what I am saying right?
If that's so, come back after defeating those Drakes.{nl}Ah, and don't forget to bring me the evidence. I've got something to report.
This place is the private farm of the Shaton family.{nl}No one can enter except for tenant farmers and the people who are permitted to enter.{nl}
If you are gonna keep spouting nonsense such as pollution, you better move out of here fast.{nl}Or... there is another way to get the permission from me.
If you receive something, then you shuld also give up something.{nl}You thought you would be able to enter without any charges here?
Very well. From now on, you will be able to enter the farm whenever you want.{nl}But, you should do something about my underlings though.
Are you looking for Druid? I know where he is. {nl}The soldiers levied the tax, but it's not enough.{nl}
I am sure that he hid it away, but I don't know where it is.{nl}The brown pocket with the grains in it. If you understood it, come fast.
It's going to take more time to look for the druid if you take more and more time.
Great work. Well done.{nl}The druid that you are looking for actually came here before.
He talked about the labor conditions of the farmers, so I sent him away with some petty excuse.{nl}He just walked off after I told him that the farmers at the workplace and the brewery weren't returning{nl}
What, that's wasn't a lie so that shouldn't be a problem.{nl}Go to Neshiva Road.
I was acting kindly to the druid because of the neighbouring farm located not far from here.{nl}Remember, if you annoy me, I will expel you from here.
Druid Martinek
You have something for me?{nl}Hold on. You came at the right time. I have to first save these people.
Druid Joel
We need lots of help here.{nl}Could you help them with me?
I will pay attention to your story later.{nl}First, here's an antidote, please use it to cure the poisoned farmers.
This is just emergency care, so I'll stay here to make more medicine.{nl}The locations that are indicated on the report are Zirta Brewery and Gausa Workplace. Please, hurry!
Shaton Farm looks peaceful at first sight.{nl}But, this land is polluted with evil energy.{nl}
I know that purification is important,{nl}but if we don't save those poisoned farmers right away, they may lose their lives.{nl}As a druid, how can I leave those people behind?
Please hurry. {nl}I assume they won't die very soon, but they must be suffering a lot.
It's fortunate that you came when you did, or else we would've been in big trouble.{nl}By the way, did you need anything from me?
I see, so Ellie finally found the true nature of the trees.{nl}And the seeds of those trees are in this box.
But these seeds are too old, we need to endow them with the power of nature.{nl}Could I borrow your help, please?{nl}
I will borrow some power from the frogs with wings.{nl}Could you exhaust them and bring them back using this stick?
These are the seeds that were discovered with the tree that the mysterious girl had left.{nl}We also found out that these seeds are that of those trees.
But, since no one knew about what these trees really were, we never thought about planting them.{nl}However, I will use these seeds to engage in the large scale purification.{nl}
It is not a hard task for a druid to revive old seeds.{nl}Of course, it will be important to look for a place to plant them first.
Make sure that the monster is alive.{nl}We can only use its power if it's alive.
Well done. {nl}If we now give them a moist environment, they will become healthy seeds.
However, the areas nearby are too polluted with evil energy. We will need a specific type of water.{nl}The water at the well of Gausa Workplace may work..
It's dangerous to go alone, so take this with you.{nl}This is a plate that is used in the ritual ceremony of the druids.{nl}It will purify the evil energy by a little bit.
The stream near here is too polluted.{nl}The water at the well of Gausa Workplace should be okay since they are located far below underground.
It's so fortunate to see you are okay. {nl}Let's start the ritual soon.
Alright, let's start. {nl}This is a simple ritual, so it should be quick.
You came.{nl}I guess I didn't plan for this.
Farm Soldier Gedson
Even if you are the Revelator, this is a private land. {nl}Go out if you don't have any business here!{nl}
If that's so, come back after defeating Cysts up there.{nl}After seeing how you behaved, I will think about whether I would just let it go or not.
I can't do this anymore.{nl}This place is corrupted with evil energy and they are not even paying me a lot.
Good. I appreciate that.{nl}But, it doesn't mean I will let you go just yet. {nl}
The one who makes me most annoyed is Drake.{nl}He is violent and looks disgusting. {nl}
Come back after defeating the drake at Ishicla farming road. {nl}I won't say anything if you could do that for me.
Those monsters are doing well even if the evil energy and the poison is all over the place.{nl}This world is such an unfair place.
As I promised, I won't say anything for your intrusion into the farm before.{nl}But, this is just my jurisdiction. Behave yourself.
The woman at the far, Charlotte
I don't wanna see Shaton family and those soldiers.
Tenant Farmer Charlotte
Please help us.{nl}We have to grow things like this, they will all die within a short period of time.
A lot of grapes were spoiled due to the evil energy.{nl}If this continues, people could die.{nl}
Please spray the herbicide on the grape vines without those soldiers knowing about it.{nl}If they find out that the grapes are not growing, Shaton might change his mind.
When was it.. I believe it was way back before Medzio Diena.{nl}There was a girl in worn out clothes who told us, with an{nl}awkward accent and gestures, that the disaster would come.{nl}
Medzio Diena came not long after that.{nl}Just like that girl said, I personally think the spoiled grapes are a part of the disaster.{nl}
I cannot fathom why he wants to harvest even those..{nl}I am sure that Shaton, the owner of this farm, has gone crazy.{nl}It surprises me to see how a person could change that much after losing his son.
What? A forest is covered with thorns and vines?{nl}I like grapes, but these grapes are spoiled with evil energy.. That's horrible, don't you think?
Thank you very much. I understand the son of Shaton is missing, but still..{nl}I have no doubt that he went crazy because of that.
Damn!{nl}Chupakabras came after smelling the polluted grape vines dried to their deathes.{nl}What should we do?
If you go near the bushes, the hidden monsters may suddenly appear.{nl}I am counting on you.
I am relieved.{nl}Thank you. Now, it will be better if Shaton regains his consciousness.
Farmer Louise
Shaton farm was not the place to live long ago.{nl}But, at least, it wasn't like this before.
Tennant farmer, Louise
I am having a hard time because of the supervisor and the soldiers.{nl}They want me to go to the Zirta Brewery.. I think they are trying to kill me.{nl}
Hey. I am sorry, but I don't have any power.{nl}If you are okay, could you go to Zirta Brewery and defeat Tontus nearby?
The soldiers want bribes and the supervisor doesn't care even if anything happens to us.{nl}And Shaton takes the taxes in the amount that would barely keep us alive.{nl}
If we don't listen to them, I am sure they will just ask for more bribes.{nl}In the end we either starve to death, or risk our lives.{nl}The old days when his son was the owner were much better.{nl}
Even if the monsters get defeated, the peaceful time wouldn't contine for a long time. The monsters would come again soon. {nl}But, do you think I can think about tomorrow when I am having hard times now?
I'm really grateful that you did this for me.{nl}I'm also thankful to the druid here. You and him are good people.
I want to ask you one more favor.{nl}There are some seeds that aren't corrupted yet. It's because I secretly stashed them.{nl}
I hid them well by avoiding the eyes of the soldiers, but the monsters blew them away.{nl}Could you get me those back? They are in the square of the farm.
I can't do this anymore.{nl}Once I get those seeds back, I will leave this farm and start my own farm.{nl}
Thank you very much for retrieving it.{nl}I understand that Shaton has lost his son, but still..{nl}I've heard that they are recruiting tenant farmers near Klaipeda's suburbs.{nl}Maybe I should go there.
I hope Shaton thinks about the people who are starving a little more.
I heard about Mr. Shaton being stubborn, but I did not know he was this stubborn.{nl}If we don't somehow persuade him, the evil energy can possibly spread across the kingdom.{nl}
You may have listened to me.{nl}But, if only you could somehow convince him.
Gord Shaton
Are you working with that druid?{nl}Are you here to tell me to plant those useless trees at my son's farm?{nl}How preposterous.
If we fail to persuade Shaton..{nl}Then our next move is to meet with his daughter.
I will hear no more about this 'purification'.{nl} Leave my lands at once!
Mary Shaton
Welcome to Shaton's farm
Vanessa Shaton
I am sorry. I apologize for my father's behavior.{nl}Please understand why he's like this. He's been suffering for my brother, who went missing a long time ago.
Look, I believe what the druid said was right.{nl}I will help you, so that my father can give up on the vineyard.
My brother left to investigate the underground tunnels but never came back.{nl}If you can find traces of my brother in the underground tunnels..{nl}I guess my father could realize the truth.
You haven't found any traces of my brother yet?{nl}There are quite a few underground tunnels near the farm, so please look in every single one of them.
My brother.. in the underground tunnels..{nl}Please show this necklace to my father, to prove to him that my brother will never return..
This grape farm belongs to my brother.{nl}My father is managing this farm on behalf of my brother.{nl}
A long time ago, my brother went missing while he was investigating the underground tunnels.{nl}All my other family members have buried him in their hearts, but my father.. couldn't do that.{nl}
I think it was from that point on,{nl}that my father continuously said my brother would eventually return,{nl}and since then he became obsessed with managing the vineyard.{nl}
James Shaton
If you are not gonna help me, get outta my land!
What is this. My son's necklace?{nl}Are you telling me that my son is dead just by showing that necklace?
You just want me to give up on my son's vineyard, don't you?{nl}Did you really think that I wasn't aware of your dirty little plan? Get out of here! I know nothing about purification.
Actually, I do know something now! That my son would never return again.{nl}Quick. Anyone! Just defeat those who killed my son!
I do not want to talk about it anymore.{nl}Get out of my sight.
Did you think you can persuade me just because you've done that?{nl}You don't know what it is like to lose a son.{nl}
That's right. It's not enough. {nl}Actually, I have something nice..
Hmm... If you have something to do in my farm, I won't block you.{nl}But, you should not disturb my subordinates or my farmers! Do you understand?
I paid a lot for this from the black market in Fedimian. {nl}It will be much more helpful than the Revelator like you or those shameless druids.{nl}
Soon, powerful monsters will be born that will only listen to my orders.{nl}Then, I will get rid of all the monsters in my son's farm.
Our colleagues came to the garden of Greene family to support us.{nl}With their help, we were able to set the protective barriers on the trees.{nl}I came here in a hurry since I had an ominous feeling. It was indeed dangerous.{nl}If it weren't you, it would have been really dangerous. Thank you.
What am I doing... {nl}I feel like my son is scolding me.{nl}
I felt like if I gave up on grape farming, it would be like losing my son completely.{nl}I knew something was wrong... I just didn't want to admit that my son was dead.{nl}
I will leave this farm to my daughter from now on.{nl}My daughter can make wise decisions. I am sorry and I want to thank you for making me realize the truth.
That is good to hear that his daughter is now managing the farm.{nl}Can you explain the large scale purification process to his daughter?
Instead of me explaining, it will be better if you explain it.{nl}The reason why Shaton gave up his obsesseion is because of you.
Yes. My father has told me about it.{nl}I am planning to plant the trees with the help of the druid in this farm.{nl}
I will give up on harvesting the grapes. And I will improve the labor conditions of the tenant farmers. {nl}I believe that my brother, who is with the goddesses right now, would have done the same.{nl}
More than anything else, thank you so much for enlightening my father... Thank you.
I am really honored to have been together with you up to now.{nl}I wish for the best of luck in the large scale purification process.{nl}
Maybe... that particular girl didn't only forecast about the disaster.{nl}Well then, may the grace of Goddess Zemyna be in your footsteps.
Steward Valen
You must think this farm is strange, right?{nl}You probably don't understand why they are growing the spoiled grapes, right?
This is the farm where Shaton is awaiting his lost son.{nl}It is why I cannot turn my back against my master. Wouldn't you agree?
If that's so, then I have a request for you.{nl}I will pay you handsomely. Please get rid of the Carcashus who are ruining this farm.
It's such a pity.{nl}His son is dead, but he just won't admit it.
Well done.{nl}Even if we plant some other crops in the future, it will be better if there are no monsters.
As you can imagine, there are many people with stomach aches due to the spoiled grapes.{nl}That's why I sent people to Klaipeda to buy medicine.
However, they were attacked by monsters and barely managed to survive.{nl}How could I find the bags with the medicine with this old body of mine?
Since I am going to share them with all the people in the farm, we need a lot.{nl}I hope my master will also eat it, but I don't know if he's going to.
Regrettably, the soldiers here only listen to the orders of the master.{nl}Thanks, I will use the medicine well.
The commander of Shaton Family, Buros
Shaton is not kind at all normally...{nl}But, he is especially sensitive today.{nl}You should be careful.
General Buros
I am working here by order, but this place feels bad.{nl}A long time ago, the son of my master disappeared in the underground tunnels. That alone is somewhat frightening.{nl}
Hey. I will share you some of my works. Are you interested?{nl}You just have to defeat Raujinutes across the tunnel.
Obsessed, perhaps too obsessed.{nl}I feel sorry for Shaton.
Well done. This is my reward to you, as promised.{nl}I have tons of work here, so you can always come back if you want.
It's you again. You just have to defeat Raujinutes across the tunnel.{nl}My subordinates don't wanna go that place since it is somewhat spooky.
Please defeat Raujintes this time as well.{nl}We are almost seeing the end so keep up the good work at the tunnel just little bit more.
I think Shaton will be satisfied now.{nl}Well done. Oh and, don't tell any others about this.
Oh my god. You must have gone crazy.{nl}I heard Scorpio appeared near the Wind Vane Tower because of you. You should be responsible for this!
My useless subordinates already ran away.{nl}Quick, go to the Wind Vane Tower.
You are the one who went crazy so you should be responsible for this.{nl}But since I also have the pride, I will pay you for that.
Hunter Oliver
I am doing an important task at the moment.{nl}If you are not gonna help me, don't disturb me.
Someone requested me to hunt for those Beeteros.{nl}They need those leaves.{nl}Don't go into too much details. I don't ask the requestor too many details.{nl}Anyways, it seems it's too much for a person.. how about it? can you help us?{nl}If you could collect the leaves, I will pay you enough.
Good decision.{nl}It will be much better to collect together instead of collecting them alone.
Are you going to receive the compensation with just those?
Hmm. The quality isn't bad.{nl}The requestor would also be satisfied.{nl}It is fortunate that we don't have any competitors. Here this is for you.
Straggling Soldier Upham
Help me! I was patrolling with my colleagues, a..and was attacked by the monsters..{nl}and then fell behind.{nl}I am begging you. Can you take me back to my general?
That's a relief. {nl}I'll be careful not to fall behind.
I don't understand why all my men are like this.{nl}Thank you very much. What a useless little..
Do you think I am still the stone in your pocket?..{nl}Do you think I will be defeated by you guys!
You guys are on the same side..{nl}I was ignorant.{nl}But you guys really think you can face me!

How should we know what the baron's thinking?{nl}All he told us was to behave well when the Revelator came...{nl}We're just doing the work he told us to do.{nl}
Well, if you go see the baron yourself, you may find out.{nl}He is working on something big at Myrkiti Farm, so why don't you go meet him?
I have to tie the sacks of grain, but I don't have enough rope.{nl}I am sure that the monsters nearby took them. Please get some tight rope for me.
Oh, ignore what the workers around here say.{nl}They are whining.
Good. {nl}Now the task here is completed.
Hey, are you the Revelator?{nl}Then I welcome you. The baron told me to treat you well.{nl}
There is a small task you can do.{nl}We don't have enough hands here. No, I am not talking about farming.{nl}
Something seems to be moving in the sacks.
I request that you finish the rest.{nl}There are some abandoned sacks at Tvora Road. I want you to take care of them.
We don't have enough workforce.{nl}Of course, the biggest reason is that the workers here are not working hard.{nl}
That garbage came from other farms due to the lack of workforce.{nl}But, I don't understand why they have to be taken care of here.
You can bury them under the ground or push them off from the cliff.{nl}I've been doing that 'til now.
Why are you back again?{nl}Did you see something that you shouldn't have seen?
Save me!{nl}Please, save me..
I feel light headed. Please get me something to eat..{nl}I hid some food in the bushes a long time ago while I was working.
I'm not sure. I was working like I usually do, and then I went upstairs... {nl}Something strange happened... It became dark...{nl}
I don't know what happened.
What happened to all the people who were with me..{nl}Just what the hell happened..
Thank you.{nl}I should recover some energy after eating this...
Soldier Stepas
Are you the supporting workforce? No? {nl}We don't have enough workforce so I want to ask someone to help us.{nl}
I need to distribute a nutritious tonic that the baron gave to me.{nl}But since this is undiluted, I should mix something into it.
The relationship between the farmer and the private soldier is always the same.{nl}One side works and the other side manages it.{nl}
Plus, it's the baron's orders,{nl}Even if he wants to share more, he can't. That's why I think their relationship is sour.{nl}
What we need is venom from the Scorpio. {nl}The Scorpio is nocturnal, so it must be sleeping at Soil of Arable.{nl}Wake it up and extract the venom out from it. Sounds easy, right?
Approach it carefully..{nl}If you attack too fast, it won't be effective.
All done. {nl}Now, I will share this with the workers.{nl}
Especially Dalius over there. He seems to always be exhausted these days.{nl}He's not doing his work and he looks exhausted.{nl}{nl}
I will take one sweet herb leaf on my way.{nl}That medicine, it's disgusting to consume it.
The Scorpio Venom.{nl}Can humans consume it?
Who are you? {nl}Stepas sent you?
Nutritious tonic? He told you to give it to me? {nl}Hmm, that's unexpected.
The poison of Scorpio was somewhat strange.{nl}Damn. It's already in effect. I won't mind it, if it doesn't threaten my life.
I have a headache. What's happening?{nl}My stomach's aching too... I'm an idiot to consume what that man gave me right away.
(Is he really going to be okay?)
I should bring lunch to my brother, he's working at Shileik Trail.{nl}Whenever I try to cross the bridge though, the bread gets spoiled.
I swear I'm not lying.{nl}Can you take it there for me?
Come back if it gets spoiled.{nl}But I only have two remaining breads so be careful.
Did my brother ask you to give this to me?{nl}I'm tired and I don't know why these kind of things keep happening...{nl}But thank you, I appreciate this.
Is it okay now?{nl}Okay then hand it over to Dalius.
Are you scared?
Strange isn't it? How come the food gets spoiled whenever I cross over there?{nl}Is it because of the smoke?{nl}
How should I know about it?{nl}If you're going back to my brother, please get rid of those strange things.{nl}I'm too scared to do it myself.
If they really are getting spoiled due to the smoke, I wonder what it is...{nl}It can't be good for your health, right?
I actually suspected that those round things were making the smoke.{nl}They always said it was created by the baron, and that a harvester like me couldn't possibly know anything about that.
So did the smoke go away?{nl}That's the first time I've seen such a thing.
Hello. I am the secretary of Baron Allerno, who is the owner of this place.{nl}There are some things that the baron told me to do, but it's not working well.{nl}I am somewhat tired also.. whenever I come out to the land, I get tired and my body doesn't seem good.{nl}Please help me a bit.
Rimas said the crops here not growing well due to the strange energy in this place.{nl}But, since there is no strange energy and the crops are growing well...{nl}Thanks for checking it.
Anyways, I received the report that the strange energy was definitely at the place you took a look at while ago.{nl}I will give the doll and some woods, use them to burn the doll.{nl}You will be prepared for some strange energy that may appear.
What? The crops died after doing what you were told to do?{nl}Was the curse of the doll little strong?
Are you the Revelator? {nl}I don't care about that, I am a bit busy right now so could you help my task?
There are some magic circles around here that we put after receiving the order of Baron Allerno.{nl}The magic circle blocks the strange energy in this region and supplies the magical power onto this generator.{nl}But, since the power of the magic circle is weak, we need to enhance it.
{nl}The true Revelator would find the way to enhance the magic circle just by looking at it.{nl}Take the bottles since you may need them.
The power generator works by using the grains that are piled up at the storage over there.{nl}That's why I needed them a lot.
{nl}The tenants are cooperating with us without any resistance.{nl}...Anyways, I am worried since that storage gets attacked by the monsters frequently these days.{nl}I guess that's not strange since we piled up the grains like that.
I can only say it's the power generator that helps the important gate which connects the two places to stay open.
What is that? Is that the head part of the sculpture? Give it to me. I got something to check.
This is the upper body part of the sculpture. Give it to me.
That's the lower body part of the sculpture...?{nl}Give it to me.
They are the wings of the sculpture.. Can you give them to me?
Thank you for saving me.{nl}I am going to return now.
No matter how many times you ask, there are not many things I can tell you. {nl}But, where did the villagers go? I don't see any familiar faces..
What? A person came out from the sack? What the hell?{nl}I really don't know anything. How could I know anything? I came from a different farm.{nl}
You've done a good job.{nl}I will report separately, so just go on your way.
This land is too infertile and the monsters have taken all the seeds.{nl}Can you find the seeds that the monsters took?
You haven't gotten enough of the seeds back yet.{nl}I am sorry, but can you get me some more?
I put them well in small bags.{nl}I think the monsters who took them ran away to Tvora Road.
If I ask the baron to give me seeds again, he may hit me. {nl}The soldiers can't say anything to the baron either.
Oh, yes. This is it.{nl}Unfortunately, this isn't all that was taken.
Now we have enough seeds. {nl}Thank you so much.
Where did Manticen hide?{nl}It's about the time that I should feed him.
{nl}Hmm? Are you new here?{nl}Then you should help my task.{nl}Please find the Manticen who ran away with the food.{nl}He may be near the brewery. I will search that side.
I am doing many tasks that the baron told me to do.{nl}Well... something like feeding...
If you find it, throw this meat to lure it.
Hmm? You defeated it since it was trying eat humans?{nl}Ah... okay...{nl}Okay. I will report to the baron.
Somehow, I came up front.{nl}It's embarassing.{nl}I am just a tenant here.
We can make lots of weapons with the leather and the stonese.{nl}Right now, we don't have enough leather.
The monsters are perfect to get the materials.{nl}You can also get the leathers from the monsters.
Now we should collect some poison.{nl}It will be used diversely.
{nl}My grandmother taught me this method.{nl}It is the method to obtain some specific substancees from the things nearby.
The farming tools are used to crave the land so they can be also used as weapons.{nl}But, we definitely need the cooperation from the tenant famers...
Please extract some Nioles from there.{nl}Niole is a thankful flower.{nl}You can make soups with the grains and they can also be used as herbs.
The problem is that the food storage often gets attacked by the monsters.{nl}I have a colleague who is protecting there, but it's always dangerous.{nl}Could you help me a bit?
The food storage is at Vinoga Brewery.
I am counting on your help with the storage.
I am working for that day.
You've defeated all the monsters that were attacking the storage!{nl}Thanks.{nl}As we were about to attack, the storage keeper hid well since you helped.{nl}I should tell him to protect the storage well.
Are you the Revelator?{nl}I often hear your stories even when I am in this kind of rural area.{nl}I am removing the magic circles that are stuck in the tenants' farm.
{nl}We are doing this kind of tasks to help Horacius.{nl}Of course, I am doing the tasks for me as well.
I've doing this job til now..{nl}Now, we have about 3 left.
The seal magic circle that was discovered in the fallow ground.. We should eliminate them.{nl}I can't break them since they have protective barrier.{nl}I will give you the stone of the blessing so try to break it by throwing this.{nl}
There's a magic circle at the entrance of Tarvas.{nl}You should break that first.{nl}But the monsters always disturb it..
Now we are almost done!{nl}Thank you so much!
It seems that the pieces that he gave to me belong to the statue of the goddess.{nl}This must be... the trace of those barons manipulating something on this ground and breaking it afterwards.{nl}You who collected these...
I am collecting the traces here.{nl}I can't tell you in details, but I am preparing for something big.{nl}To do that, I need to persuade the tenant farmers.{nl}So I am collecting those.
There's a magic circle before you reach Ramus Intersection.{nl}And the smoke is coming up from the ground.{nl}That's called the strange energy.
Monsters fall into the eternal sleep.. dying..{nl}The monsters die due to the energy that is coming out from there...{nl}The monsters are tiresome and vicious.
{nl}The monsters fall into the eternal sleep due to that energy, that proves that the energy is not bad.
The amount of the crops after harvesting reduced a lot from some point of time in the past.{nl}Even if we care a lot, the crops wither easily.{nl}I think it may be due to the magic circle that the barons created on this land.{nl}Could you help me out?
{nl}That's why the amount of the crops was reduced.{nl}I am trying to find the reason for it.
This magic circle has some kind of protective barrier so it's not easy to break it.{nl}So I am trying to light it up.{nl}To break the shield, I should maintain the flame.
{nl}Should we kill those orange Dandells and throw kindlings on them?{nl}Try it.
The barons are pludering a lot these days and the magic circles like that have been created a lot across this region. Some of them are less shiny.{nl}Anyways, you get hurt from the ones that shine more so it's hard to eliminate them.
You came at the right time. I connected the pieces with some sticky stuff.{nl}...As I expected. This is a Goddess Statue.{nl}I could only glue them like this with my skill... It will break again if I don't do it well.{nl}I am sorry that I just glued them like this...
{nl}Hey, take it.
Oh really?{nl}Very well done!{nl}Too bad about the statue.. but the goddesses would forgive this.
There's a uncompleted seal magic circle down there.{nl}The seal is not complete yet so the strange energy is coming out from it, but the problem is that it doesn't look like that.
{nl}It is suspicious.{nl}I have to connect these pieces, so can you find out more about the energy?
To accomplish a big task...{nl}You should first collect the clues.{nl}You can only persuade the tenant farmers with them.
The crops aren't growing... There aren't anything to eat..
The enhancement of the magic circle and the magical power supply are closely related to each other.
We are keep going to do the task to find ours and let the truth spreads.{nl}But, your task will end here.{nl}You can go on your way.{nl}I really thank you for helping us this far.
Revelator.{nl}We are now ready.{nl}Now, we are going to do our work.
Well then, I will be inside your little pocket now.{nl}Don't forget. Trust no one.
The Goddess wants you to eliminate all demons in the prison.{nl}The demons became unforgivable creatures after Medzio Diena.
But, since the demons are coming through the space of the metastasis, it's not going to be easy.{nl}You should resist the demons that are trying to free the Demon Lord, Blut.
This place is not the world of humans or the demons' world, but it is another isolated place.{nl}We've locked the demons in this prison that are not helpful in this world.{nl}
It was like that before Medzio Diena, but the circumstances have changed a lot.{nl}We now have reasons to destroy the demons. They caused Medzio Diena.{nl}
But, it's not easy since the space of metastasis is keep enlarging.{nl}The demons are keep coming through the space of the metastasis.
Lots of demons are gathering at Rituala to paricipate the ritual to free Blut.{nl}Please first defeat them.
The servants of the Demon Lord, Blut are trying to escape from here by breaking the power of the barrier.{nl}}Hauberk's help will be useful this time.
Well done. You have prevented the worst case scenario.{nl}Now it is time to stem Demon Lord Blut's power.
At last, I meet the one whom my spirit has been looking for.{nl}I am the Demon Lord Hauberk. I have a proposal for you.{nl}
Please help me to get back a part of my spirit.{nl}In return I will tell you the location of Vakarine, the goddess of the Night Star...{nl}This should be an interesting proposal for you.
Alright. The deal is established.{nl}Do not worry. I won't hurt you.
Strange.{nl}Unlike other humans, I can't possess your body.{nl}
I do not have any other choice then. Take my seal fragment and go in there.{nl}I will guide you from there.
Now, Zydrone is holding Blut.{nl}But, I don't know how much we can endure by ourselves.{nl}
We should somehow reduce the influence of the Demon Lord, Blut.{nl}Please take the secreting gland of Blut away from Blut's allies at Bjaurer Hideout.
He was the head of the demons that are locked in this district.{nl}They were trying to control this prison somehow and looking for chances to escape from here.{nl}
Actually, Blut told the others proudly that Hauberk turned out like that because of him.{nl}There were followers to the demons that were increasing their influence and Hauberk was leading all that.{nl}
Blut thought that Hauberk was being presumptuous so he told about it to Giltine.{nl}That's why he got ripped off by Helgasercle.
Vakarine and the other Kupoles are also having hard time.{nl}Let's finish our task here fast and go to a different district to help.
This will be a great help to Zydrone.{nl}I will eliminate these. Blut should feel like he's lost his senses right now.
To defeat the Demon Lord Blut completely, our power is not enough.{nl}I didn't want to do this before, but let's try getting some help from Hauberk.{nl}
There's something which Blut stored his power in at the altar at the Concentrated Management Area.{nl}Only demons can control it, but we have Hauberk.
After Hauberk absorbs that power, please go help Zydrone right away.{nl}To Nuzikalti Hall. Hurry. We don't have much time.
We are the attendants who are serving the goddesses.{nl}Our work differs depending on which goddess we serve.
Our original task was to manage and supervise the prison.{nl}Now, with Vakarine's control, our task is to close the dimensional crack and defeat the demons.
The power of the demons reject the power of the goddesses.{nl}This role completely depends on Hauberk.
So you are the one who Vakarine mentioned.{nl}Good. The goddess will lead the everything.
I've locked Blut in the barrier of the prison, but he won't endure there for long time.{nl}We should attack all at once. Are you ready?
If we weren't able to defeat Blut here, Vakarine may have fallen down together.{nl}Hurry to the 2nd District. Medeina is waiting there.
Damn. The demons that lost their leader, Blut is trying to escape to the outer world.{nl}If they succeed on breaking the weak part of the barrier, a catastrophe would result.
The area where the influence of the goddesses could reach is getting smaller.{nl}We should somehow help out the Goddesses..
Well done.{nl}If the demons come out to the outer world, a catastrophe would result.
The human expedition team actually came here.{nl}But, unfortunately, they all died.{nl}
I want to calm their spirits by finding their belongings.{nl}But, it's not easy since the demons are carrying them like their booties.
Humans should not come here.
Thank you. {nl}I hope there are no more sacrifices like this...
Kupole Medeina
We are in a trouble.{nl}The barrier of the Goddess is breaking due to the mighty power of the Demon Lord, Nuaele.{nl}
Aldona went to face against Nuaele since he wants to resist some more.{nl}If you could reduce the mighty power of Nualele a bit... It will help Aldona a lot!
The barrier of the goddess is like a great wall surrounding this prison.{nl}It will block the demons coming into the prison or escaping from here.{nl}
The dimensional crack started was created on the barrier due to Medzio Diena.{nl}Vakarine is having hard time since she should maintain the barrier and face the demons at the same time.
Please hurry to the 1st District before the demons meet Nuaele. {nl}I want you to eliminate them.
Goddesses.{nl}Please protect Aldona..
Well done.{nl}Since you've defeated many demons and their power will be reduce a lot.
Nuaele is luring his subordinates and spreading his influence with the pieces of the seal of Hauberk.{nl}Hauberk should feel something.{nl}
There are more methods to increase the power of Hauberk using that.{nl}Hauberk would also want that.
Nuaele was in fact not that strong of a Demon Lord.{nl}But, after obtaining the seal piece of Hauberk, he spread his influence at a astonishingly fast pace.{nl}
After losing his master, Hauberk's subordinates started to follow him who has the piece of the seal.{nl}They are like betrayers to Hauberk.
Hauberk is retriving his manes that he gave to his subordinates as a symbol of their faithfulness.{nl}Now, go to the 2nd isolated area. They must be gathered there.
The subordinates of Hauberk are still following Nuaele as if he is Hauberk.{nl}But, if Hauberk retrieves his manes, they will know who is their true master.{nl}
Now, the Demon Lord, Nuaele would know it.{nl}In order to escapse from this prison, he should not only rely on his subordinates.{nl}But, its too late now.
By the way, Nuaele's behavior is somewhat strange.{nl}In fact, with the power that he accumulated secretly for a long time, he may just break the barrier and go out.{nl}
But, for us, we are waiting for someone that we don't know. {nl}I guess we should interrogate the subordinates of Nuaele.
I will give you the marbles that I received from the Goddess.{nl}We, Kupoles can't do it, but since Hauberk is a demon, he would be able to read our mind.
When the power of the goddesses get weak, the mighty power of us, Kupoles also get weak.{nl}Furthermore, trying to disturb the minds of the demons, it's impossible.
He was thinking about changing the prison into his demonic world from the first place.{nl}If this place falls under the hands of him, even Ausrine can't do anything.
Since we've found out Nuaele's intention, we should be moving fast.{nl}
How about we first attack * monster at the 4th isolated area?{nl}If we could defeat it, it's like we are defeating one of the strongest weapons of Nuaele.
Hauberk was once the strongest Demon Lord who led the largest army.{nl}After he was sealed, I thought no one as strong as him would appear again.{nl}
However, Nuaele is imitating Hauberk as if she is the original with the fragment of his seal.{nl}He became the strongest Demon Lord at least in this district.
You now see the end of someone who tried to use another's power instead of using his own.
He was in fact the subordinate of Hauberk. Hauberk won't need him anymore.{nl}After Hauberk was sealed, he ran to Nuaele and handed over the seal piece to him.
Nuaele is disappeared, but his ramnents are gathering at the 1st isolated area.{nl}They are going to continue his mission. Get rid of those demons.
You have to be more careful.{nl}Hauberk and Nuaele became symbolic figures to the demons.
Many demons came here through the dimensional crack to support the Demon Lord here.{nl}It will be the same in other places as well. Thanks to you we now have peace.
If it continues like this, the demons will stand up again.{nl}Help us so that the demons that are locked in the prison do not look down on us.
The demons look down on us.{nl}It will take a long time before the rules here get established here.
I will pass these necklaces to the sisters myself.{nl}May the Goddesses protect you.
Nuaele is having the ritual ceremony to summon the demons in his district.{nl}But, all of his arms are legs are disconnected so its going to be easy to defeat him.{nl}
Meet Aldona. {nl}He would take you to the area of Nuaele.
Without Aldona's help, you will never enter the area of where Nuaele resides.{nl}You should seek for guidance from Aldona.
Nuaele's behavior was something that can't be accepted.{nl}If he stayed quietly, he would have been forgiven.{nl}
Let's go to District 3.{nl}Vakarine is waiting for your help.
Hauberk and the savior.{nl}With help from you, I can now punish the Demon Lord, Baltrus.{nl}But the threat of the space of the metastasis still exists.{nl}
My poor Dionys..{nl}I will remove the strong power that is controlling her and close the space of the metastasis.{nl}
Complete the Evening Star Key by helping Zydrone.{nl}With that key, you will be able to remove the power from Dionys.
The strong power that we tried to protect from Baltrus is controlling the ego of Dionys.{nl}Fortunately, that power can be detached and be put in the key of the night star.{nl}
Plese close the space of the metastasis that are on the scar of the metastasis first.{nl}Because of the waves coming out from the space, I can't hardly focus on the ritual.
We don't know exactly what is the strong power that is controlling Dionys.{nl}We just know that it could close the space of the metastasis and it should not be stolen.{nl}
While the goddess was maintaining the barrier of the prison, she also had to fight against Baltrus at the same time.{nl}If the goddess gets defeated, that power can't be protected..{nl}
The Goddess had to make a hard decision.{nl}Until the prison gets stabilized, she will seal the power to Dionys who is like family to her.
Dionys is the guardian who Vakarine most takes care.{nl}She reluctantly sealed the strong power to Dionys and fell into the deep sadness..
We can start the ritual now.{nl}When the Evening Star Key is completed, we could probably retrieve his ego.
We could go to Orualma grand corridor to put the power of the Goddess into the key of the night star.{nl}As I am charging the key, please protect me from the demons.
It's all completed. Please hand over this key to Aldona.{nl}Aldona is blocking the attacks of Dionys so please hurry up.
Soon.. We would collapse.{nl}Dionys is too strong to face against by us, Kupoles.{nl}
Vakarine saved some power to prepare for the worst outcome.{nl}With the key of the night star, please unleash the seals of Rewalda, Kasa and Rada Seals.
The problem is the time.{nl}If you are late, Vakarine can't do anything.
The power of the Goddesses is accumulating at the magical suppressor.{nl}We are now all ready. And we have enough time.
We will now remove the power from Dionys.{nl}If we fail, Dionys may escape from here with the power.{nl}
It's going to bring the same result like unleashing tens of Demon Lords.{nl}You should approach it carefully. Tell me when you are ready.
The direction where Hauberk ran away is District 4 where Daiva is protecting.{nl}First, go back to the Goddess. I will take care of Dionys.
Savior. You are now ready to know the truth.{nl}The reason why I am just leaving Hauberk like that is because he too is the key to close the space of the metastasis.{nl}
The power that he took away from Dionys is called the chain of revivification.{nl}He was planning to close the space of the metastasis using that chain and the spirit of Hauberk.{nl}
But since you are here, it's not too late.{nl}The District 4, the place where he ran away to is like a maze. Daiva will be able to chase after him.
How come Vakarine left Hauberk to go crazy like that..{nl}I guess she must have a reason for that.
Even if we defeat Baltrus, that doesn't mean we have peace in this prison.{nl}The demons who lost their leader is going crazy here.{nl}
His subordinates are keep gathering at the grand corridor of Orualma. {nl}Please defeat them.
We, Kupoles are different.{nl}Even if the goddesses are not around, we don't get violent.{nl}
We are the symbol of the rules and the principles.
The Goddesses rest at the grand corridor and recover her power.{nl}That's why it has to be safe all the time from the demons. Thank you so much.
Dionys is weak.{nl}If you could find his toenails, he will recover his energy.{nl}
There are many demons who ran away after getting attacked by Dionys near Rewalda seal.{nl}You may find the toe nails of Dionys from them.
Dionys was originally the normal creature from the human world.{nl}Vakarine accepted him who was playing with the demons violently.{nl}
Now he is the most faithful guardian of Vakarine.{nl}He lost his consciousness due to that power, but he must be suffering a lot himself.
Vakarine will recover fast when Dionys recovers.{nl}There are many things for Dionys to do other than that.
Thanks. {nl}This will greatly help Dionys who is very weak at the moment.
When Dionys lost his ego, the Rada Seal risked breaking down.{nl}Fortunately, he regained his consciousness before that, but he could not save the Mark of Star.{nl}
Please collect the pieces of the symbol of the star that are scattered near Rada Seal.{nl}It will help the Goddess to recover her power.
Dionys' power is astonishing.{nl}Even th violent Baltrus were busy running away instead of touching him.
Thanks. {nl}If the Goddesses recover, Dionys would also recover.
Hauberk just passed here.{nl}I am sure that he is trying to break the barrier of the Goddess who hasn't been fully recovered and escape by breaking the barrier.{nl}
The barrier at the Nebilau Broken District is most weak so he must have went there.{nl}Hurry and follow him. I will block the route.
Now, Hauberk is risking everything he's got.{nl}Now is the only chance that he can restore everything about him.
Anything Hauberk tries won't be effective.{nl}Let's keep pressuring him, and chase him to the very end.
It seems that Hauberk's servants are coming again.{nl}I think he's trying to deceive us by giving the fragments of his soul to his servants, but that's also what we want.{nl}
Please collect the pieces of the spirit by defeating the subordinates of Hauberk at the internal isolated area.{nl}Our objective is to collect more pieces of his spirit.
I will chase after Hauberk while I am collecting the fragments of his soul.{nl}Let's meet in front of Idinga Solitary Confinement.
Even if Hauberk does something, this is inside the prison.{nl}As long as we are chasing, Hauberk could never run away.
Well done. {nl}They might have succeeded in slowing us down, but they did not buy themselves much time at all.
They are trying to escape by borrowing the bodies of his subordinates. {nl}Let's keep searching by defeating the demons that contains Hauberk. Until he gives up.
Please take this Night Star Spectral Orb.{nl}We can find Hauberk easily with this.
I will push Hauberk to the single path where he won't be able to run away.{nl}If he tries to give up and run away, I will block here.
Don't worry too much even if he runs away.{nl}It's going well as planned.
Success!{nl}No more escaping.
We will start the hunting from now on.{nl}There is only single path in front so Hauberk would resist hard.{nl}
Push Hauberk into Galutin Solitary Confinement.{nl}Don't worry since Sigita is blocking Hauberk's exit at the opposite side.
Hauberk is like a rat that has no where to hide.{nl}Tell me when you are ready to attack.
Well done. We will take the sealed Hauberk and the strong power to the Goddess.{nl}The Goddess is waiting at the District 5 in the prison. Please hurry up to her.
We've got Hauberk, but the problem is their subordinates.{nl}We don't know what they will do in the future.{nl}
Hauberk's remnant forces are gathering again at the Aklaga Isolation Area.{nl}I want you to get rid of them.
The dimensional crack is the problem.{nl}There weren't this many low-class demons before.
Thank you. {nl}I will stay here and pursue the remaining demons.
Some of Hauberk's servants ran away to Ishidevi Hideout. {nl}They are probably hoping for a revival, like Nuaele's. {nl}
We cannot let that happen again. {nl}Please defeat the demons around the Ishidevi Hideout.
Leaving Nuaele alone just because it was trapped was a source of trouble. {nl}We paid a big price for that lesson.
Good work. {nl}I will track down every last demon so that they can't resist against the goddess.
The Goddess may disagree but we need to show them a lesson. {nl}Can you defeat the demons in Hradeti Crossroads and get their teeth?
The demons need to learn their lessons. {nl}It's rather gentle compared to what they did.
Thank you. {nl}Please keep it a secret from the Goddess.
It was with your help that we made it until here. {nl}The prisons will no longer be threatened by the demons anymore. {nl}
We will perform the ritual for closing the gap so better be prepared.
The waves of the dimensional crack have become stronger than ever. {nl}We can no longer fill it with Hauberk's soul alone. {nl}
I feel heavy-hearted to keep burdening you. {nl}But this is something only you can help.
We will add the power of demons to the sealed soul of Houvberg. {nl}I will give you the Evening Star Rune but it is not in its complete state.
Please defeat the demons in Aushra Chapel and collect the traces of the crossover. {nl}It will be an important tool for collecting the power of demons.
There is something I realized after meeting you. {nl}That I should have accepted Laima's warning in the first place.
You've gathered enought to fill the Evening Star Rune. {nl}You can use this to draw soul of demons.
Here. Take the Evening Star Rune.
Use the Evening Star Rune on the demons in Rankine Isolation District and incapacitate them. {nl}The demons will then be pulled to me by the power in the Runes.
From here, I will combine those demons with the soul of Hauberk.
A goddess and a demon cannot easily interfere with each other's souls. {nl}Only a Revelator like you can do so.
Good work, Revelator. {nl}The demons you sent are being combined with soul of Hauberk.
We still need more of demons' souls. {nl}Please use the Evening Star Rune on the demons in Ishsula Ruins Area too.
Then the Kupoles will go to collect them..
The dimensional crack is connected with the demon's world so it can't be removed without the power of the demons. {nl}That is why your role, not the goddess' nor the demons', is important.
Now it's almost full. {nl}But I can't feel any more demons to gather.
We have no choice but to resort to the last measure. {nl}Retrieve the Mark of Seal that was fastened on the powerful demons. {nl}
The Mark of Seal absorbs the power of its host. {nl}You can get it by using the Evening Star Rune on the demons in Etmesta Isolation District.
We couldn't watch every demon by its side. {nl}So we used the Mark of Seal to prevent their powers to manifest.
Good work. {nl}These Marks can strengthen the soul of Hauberk.
We have gathered enough power to close the gap. {nl}Please look out while me and the Kupoles close the gap.
The disaster that took its root in the prison is now gone. {nl}All credits belong to you, Revelator. {nl}
I plan to stay here for some time. {nl}If you need the power of a goddess, you may come anytime for help.
With the gap closed, the demons that lost its way are forming groups of their own. {nl}But I no longer have the strength to move for the time being. {nl}
The demons should never stay in groups, not for the future. {nl}Please break the power of demons that are gathered in Vanaga Surveillance Area.
The demons are using the aura of disaster to strengthen its powers. {nl}We may have blocked immediate disaster but peace still seems to be far away.
If I don't pay attention just for a while, the gap will open again. {nl}I hope you find Laima as soon as you can.
We were able to find Dionys with your help but he's slow recovery is causing him too much pain. {nl}Can you get the empty souls from the demons in Pasaga Isolation Area?
If Dionys recovers, the prison can be stabilized even if I'm not here.
Thank you. {nl}If Dionys recovers, it will all be thanks to you. {nl}{nl}
Small gaps are forming in places where my power is not reached. {nl}Even the Kupoles are focused in stabilizing process so there is no one to close the gap in Gavara Isolation Area. {nl}
Can you take the role for us?
I bear debt to Zydrone and Aldona, and even you.
Thank you, Revelator. {nl}If all powers are restored, I will take all measures possible to block the gaps from forming.
It's done. {nl}I hope it works.. Can you give this meat to the pilgrim down below? {nl}{nl}You must feed him until he's satisfied. {nl}It's all the meat that you got. 15 pieces, right?
Do I still look like a stone in your pouch.. {nl}You think this Hauberk will fall just like that!
You were all in this together from the start.. {nl}I was foolish.{nl}But do you think you can take on my powers now!

I am the secretary of the farm owner, Baron Allerno. {nl}Lord Allerno wants your help in purifying this land.
Lord Allerno hired wizards to build a laboratory for purifying the farm. {nl}He gave the whole farm for it. {nl}
Everyone is tired because of the strange aura. {nl}But they say that this aura will disappear when the device is complete so we'll be fine soon. {nl}
The work is simple. {nl}All workers, including me, are feeling very exhausted because of the strange aura. {nl}Please check if it is also affecting the the crops near the Abandoned Farmland.
Still not finished yet? {nl}Baron Allerno's expecting a lot from the Revelator.
There is a strange aura right? {nl}But it's not affecting the crops.. That's different from Rimas' story.
The strange aura is definitely there, so we should get rid of it.{nl}If we just perform the ritual Wizard Rimas told us...{nl}Sorry, I suddenly feel a bit dizzy.
Oh I'm causing such trouble.. Thank you. {nl}You just have to make a magic circle with the firewood I give you and burn the Shaman doll on top of it.
I want to sit and rest. {nl}But I can't do that as a secretary.
The crops died when you did what you were told to do? {nl}It's okay. I was told that the bad aura within the crops will go away like that. {nl}
Now things will grow better. {nl}Anyway, if you haven't met the baron, I suggest you do.
Wizard Rimas
Welcome to the farm.{nl}The baron is deeply worried about the contamination of this farm so allow me to welcome you for him.
Worries? Ah, the spells aren't concentrated in power because of the strange aura.{nl}We tried laying a magic circle in every test area but they're weaker than expected.
Oh, this is a very important device. {nl}The portal and the power to retain it.. Oops, forget about what I just said. {nl}
It is something needed to remove the strange aura in this land. {nl}I'm talking about purification. Isn't it such a problem?
Well, how is it going?
Thank you. Check the magic circle in the test area first. {nl}If you come across a weird crystal, it's a working magic circle so you only have to remove the weird crystals.{nl}
But if there is no crystal, then it mean there is a problem. {nl}You just have to gather the evil force of monsters in this bottle and bury it near the magic circle.
Great. {nl}But this isn't the only problem.
That power device works with the energy of nature.{nl}With crops, it'll receive plenty of nature's energy.{nl}But, the monsters there are preying on that warehouse and it might become a problem.
Luckily, the tenant farmers are cooperative. {nl}But it's a pain that the monsters are preying on that warehouse.
The power source needs energy of nature and what do you think can be used right away? {nl}The crops in the warehouse, that is. {nl}
Don't worry. We'll have a good harvest if we solve the corruption problem. {nl}And if that portal is also maintained.
It's the Old Food Storage warehouse site. {nl}After all, there's a pile of crops there, so the monsters could prey on it.
I can't leave this place because I have to guard it. {nl}But I can't make the baron go himself either.
Now we can have some peace for a while. {nl}We just have to keep that portal.. Hmm, anyway, never mind.
Wait that.. seems like a familiar statue? {nl}Sorry but can I take a look?
Ah, right. I forgot about the magic circles at Stishka Farm Road. {nl}Take this and try spraying it. I prepared it before. {nl}
I had a hard time gathering it from the monsters and refining it. {nl}Don't worry. Even evil auras can be useful, depending on how you handle it.
(Something doesn't feel right about this liquid...{nl}To enhance the magic circle with this sounds suspicious, but let's give it a try.)
This is a big problem. Where did it go with the food? {nl}Hey, I'm sorry but can you help find the Manticen? {nl}
Manticen? Nothing's weird about it. It's a monster. {nl}The baron needs it, so I'm looking after it. It likes food. {nl}
Don't ask about where it's needed. {nl}It's all for the farm.
It might be near the brewery. I will look around that area. {nl}If you find it, throw this meat to lure it.
Baron Secretary Benius
This is tough. {nl}Many might be killed..
Hmm? You killed it because it tried to eat people? {nl}Ah... Well then, nevermind. I will report it to the baron.
Even in a rural area like this, we have heard about you. {nl}We are preparing to fight against the baron's arrogant plundering. {nl}
It would be a great support to us if you could help us supply ourselves with weapons.
I just happened to take the lead like this. {nl}I'm just a tenant farmer who could no longer stand the baron's exploitation and tyranny.
What makes us even more angry is that he is trying to fool us under the guise of purification. {nl}All he does is a disgrace to the goddess' name.
Please get some wooden rods from the wooden structures nearby. {nl}We're going to make weapons.
We don't know how much we can fight the baron's guards. {nl}But we fight, that will have some meaning.
This will be about enough. {nl}I will tell you more later, but if what I suspect is right, the baron betrayed the goddess.
The baron is said to have ordered the magic circles to be put up around the farm to suppress the strange aura. {nl}But that was a lie. The baron is not interested in purification. {nl}
Please help us get leather for making weapons. {nl}You can get it from the monsters nearby.
There are strange auras spread all over the farm.{nl}The baron said they were dangerous and gave orders to make magic circles to suppress them.
But nobody was hurt by the strange aura. {nl}It's ridiculous. Instead, the crops grew rather well.
We won't just stand by anymore.
That will be enough. Thank you. {nl}To be honest, I don't care what the baron wants. {nl}But...
I mean even if what the baron wants really is purification. {nl}With my colleagues gone, it's nonsense that I have to bear the expensive farm rent fees.
That's what I think. Now... I have to collect poison. {nl}It will be useful.
I'm not sure if this is his weak point. {nl}But I think something is hidden in the Aqueduct Bridge Area's Restricted Area.{nl}
He's a greedy old man so there must be something. I'm sure of it.
Place the poison pot, lure the monster to it, then kill it. {nl}Bring it to me when enough is collected.
I'm sorry for having to ask something like this of you. {nl}But please feel pity on us and help us out a little more.
I'm thinking about borrowing farm tools from the farmers nearby for improvised weapons. {nl}You are a famous Revelator, so it should be fairly easy for you to convince them.
If you persuade them with the letter I give you, they will understand.
So many... Thank you so much. {nl}Oh, and if you have time, I hope you can help my colleagues as well.
I am Horacius' colleague. I'm in charge of the food supplies.{nl}The promised day is coming, but we don't have enough manpower. Can you help us?
We will support Horacius.{nl}Everyone is tired of the unreasonable farm rent fees.
The baron secretary used to protect us, but now they're gone...{nl}We have only our own two hands to trust.
Then please collect Nioles from Riaum Hill.{nl}We can use them with potatoes to make soup, and they're also used as medicine.
Even if the baron did something right, he only did it for himself. {nl}No one can blame us for what we're doing.
Dried food has a long shelf life.{nl}You'll feel full even when you consume only a small amount of beef jerky.{nl}That's why we're accumulating a lot of it.
The farm rent fees have become a burden recently.{nl}The baron used weird reasons to collect them more often.{nl}
My colleague even disappeared one day.{nl}Since then, whatever the baron says about purification and all seem like a lie.{nl}
I believe all this has something to do with the baron.{nl}I want to find out what it is, even if I have to resort to violence.{nl}Horacius agrees too.
You need to get edible meat from the monsters nearby.{nl}Once we have the meat, you just have to place it in the dryer.
The point is to get edible meat from the monsters.{nl}Most of them are tough and fishy.
Thank you very much. {nl}We need to be full to fight well.
Lastly... The problem is that the monsters frequently prey on the food storage house. {nl}There is a fella guarding that place but it's constanly exposed to danger.
The Food Storage is at Vinoga Brewery.{nl}Do you think it's already too late though?
The storage keeper told me to thank you for him.{nl}Oh, and if you see my colleagues asking for help, please help them.
Are you the Revelator?{nl}News like that reaches us, even out here.
I'm helping Horacius remove the baron's magic circles.{nl}If it's alright, can you help me?
The baron said the strange aura is dangerous and told us not to go near it.{nl}But I don't think that's the case.
It's actually similar to the aura I felt from the giant statue of Goddess Zemyna in Fedimian.{nl}I wonder if it actually purifies the land instead.
Let's see. Now there are around 3 left. {nl}Darbas Entrance, Padeka Altar, and the Fallow Ground.
The people in this farm used to pray to Goddess Zemyna from the Padeka Altar.{nl}After the baron made magic circles though, the monsters took over that place.
I can only assume that the monsters were drawn to the magic circle. {nl}The magic circle is suppressing the divine power of the altar..? or something.
It's a monster called Kirmeleech. {nl}Don't forget to remove the magic circle after defeating the monster.
It's been a while since we've offered prayers because of Kirmeleech. {nl}What if the goddess is angry?
Good job.{nl}Now we can pray to Goddess Zemyna again.
The magic circle at Fallow Ground has protective barriers so it's difficult to destroy it right away. {nl}I will give you some Magic Stones of Blessing. Try using these to destroy it.
I used to take priest lessons before Medzio Diena. {nl}I'm here now because I like farming more.
You will get hurt if you go near the magic circle rashly. {nl}Be sure to destroy the magic circle using magic stone of blessings.
You did it! {nl}Now this farm is back to looking the way it should.
This is the last one. {nl}The magic circle in Tarvas Entrance will have a lot of monsters interfering. {nl}With the divine power suppressed, the monsters are naturally drawn to that area.
The magic circle isn't attracting the monsters, but it's suppressing the divine power.{nl}That's why the monsters are gathering.
All the magic circles in this farm are destroyed.{nl}Now we can only hope for Horacius' work to succeed.
This looks like part of the Goddess Statue that used to stand.{nl}Seems like someone destroyed it on purpose... Could it be the baron?
You don't look like one of the baron's people at least.{nl}We need help. We want to revive this farm and we'll do whatever it takes.{nl}
The Baron is doing something to purify this farm. {nl}But recently the crops are dying and people are starting to fall sick. {nl}
I couldn't believe it at first, but if this piece is really from a Goddess Statue.. {nl}Either the baron is lying to us or something is wrong.
First, I better stick the pieces together. {nl}It may be a little blasphemous but can you get some Sticky Sap from the monsters?
I feel like it's soiling the Goddess Statue but I have nothing else so we'll have to settle for that. {nl}The goddess will forgive us.
Yes. That will be enough. Let me try sticking this together first. {nl}Oh, and one more thing.
The baron has a bad reputation because of the things he has done. {nl}And for what he's been up to nowadays.. He must be planning on something. {nl}
Some people say 'the baron is human, after all', so he won't do such things. {nl}So we need to collect clues to persuade them.
If you head toward the crossroad, you'll see an oddly sparkling smoke. {nl}Attack a monster and take it there before killing it. You might find something out, don't you think?
No results yet? {nl}There should be some reaction whether good or bad if you check using the monster.
Surely suspicious. {nl}If that aura is a bad aura, it wouldn't attack a monster, right? {nl}
I've got good evidence thanks to you. {nl}This might be enough to persuade the others. Thank you!
Varas
No matter how much I think about it, the magic circles are the reason the harvest is bad. {nl}It's not purifying the land but rather making it worse.{nl}
Even if this is the baron's order, this is too much. {nl}But what can I do when all I've ever held was a plow.
This area used to be a fertile land. {nl}But ever since the baron's men made the magic circles, harvests decreased a lot. {nl}
Purify? That's not even funny. {nl}We farmers know better about this land.
You can remove it by lighting fire with my firewood. {nl}But there is a protective shell so even if you light fire, the fire will easily die out. {nl}
I think it's better to get kindlings from the Dandels all over the area to keep the fire.
I can't stand paying ridiculous farm rent fees at times like this. {nl}How can he do that, as a human?
Did you do it? {nl}That's great. But there are more magic circles.
If the magic circles are really a like, then you should be able to remove the magic circles in Talia trails with Goddess' power. {nl}I mean something like the Goddess Statue. Is there any way to get it?
If the magic circles really are for the better, I can just pay more rent and ask for forgiveness. {nl}We'll know for sure if we check with the goddess' power.
But if it isn't, the baron better be prepared. {nl}He fooled us, harmed the land, and betrayed close friends.
Indeed Joana has it. Use that power to remove the magic circle. {nl}Then checking the crops around will confirm it.
You're just in time. {nl}You said you needed this Goddess Statue, right? Here, take it.
{memo X duplicate line}I used the Sticky Sap to glue the pieces and indeed, it was a Goddess Statue. {nl}But this is all I can do so.. It might break easily.
The magic circle will be a problem whether it's good or bad. {nl}But at least, it's better than begging the baron.
I used the Sticky Sap to glue the pieces and indeed, it was a Goddess Statue. {nl}But this is all I can do so.. It might break easily.
Alright. Thank you very much. {nl}At least now we know the magic circle is bad for sure. {nl}
Anyway, I feel bad for the Goddess Statue being broken, but don't be so discouraged. {nl}The goddess will forgive us.
If the magic circle can't be removed by the power of the goddess, the baron had better be prepared. {nl}He will probably claim that the power of the goddess is evil. I'll watch what he has to say.
Have you seen the crops pouch the monsters took from me? {nl}Can you please help me find it? I need to pay for the farm rent.
If I don't pay, I will surely be kicked out this time. {nl}Please help me.
Thank you very much. {nl}I worked so hard to gather it all and they just threw it to the monsters.. Those awful guards..
There is an unstable magic circle on the way to Ramus Crossroads. {nl}They say to not go near it because a strange aura flows out from it. But it really doesn't seem so. {nl}
It's full of suspicious stuff. {nl}I have to glue these pieces together so can you check that aura for me?
Thank you for helping us. {nl}From now on, we won't just stand back.
I hope the goddess blesses your journey..{nl}Please wish us luck.
Revelator, it is time. {nl}Now we will do what we have to do.
Good work. {nl}With so many demons defeated, her vigor should be softened.
The servants of Hauberk who lost their commander started to follow her. {nl}They essentially betrayed Hauberk.
It's retrieving the Mark that Hauberk gave his servants as sign of loyalty. {nl}Go to 2nd Isolation Area. They must be gathered there.
Even now, Hauberk's servants think Nuaele is Hauberk. {nl}But if Hauberk gets back his marks, then they will realize who the real master is. {nl}
But Nuaele is acting strangely. {nl}With the powers she's been collecting, it's actually enough to break through the barrier. {nl}
You will need Hauberk's help. {nl}Hauberk is also a demon so he must be able to read the thoughts.
She planned to make this Demon Prison her demonic world from the start. {nl}If this place falls under her hands, not even Ausrine will be able to do anything about it.
What about striking the monsters in 4th Isolation Area first? {nl}If we defeat them, it will be like gettting rid of Nuaele's strongest weapons.
They used to be Hauberk's servants. I'm sure Hauberk doesn't need them anymore. {nl}They ran to Nuaele right away the minute Hauberk was sealed and gave her the Piece of Seal.
Nuaele was eliminated, but the demons at the 4th isolated area are still not following her order.{nl}If you don't eliminate her fragments from them, the demons would move again.
{nl}We should not let this kind of thing occur again in the future.{nl}Please retrieve the fragments of Nuaele by defeating the demons at the 4th isolated area.
It will take a long time to re-establish order in the prison.{nl}It will take a long time, just like Nuaele did preparing for now..
Thanks. I will break the fragments myself. {nl}I wish the Goddesses protect you.
Nuaele is engaged in the ritual to summon the demons in his area at the moment.{nl}However, since his arms and legs are all disconnected, it's going to be easy to defeat him.{nl}
You've eliminated the gigantic space of the metastasis, but there are too many demons that came across so far..
We have to use the last method.{nl}Please retrieve the symbols of the seal which was put on the demons that had strong power.
The symbol of seal would absorb the one's power whose name is engraved on the seal.{nl}You would be able to obtain the power if you defeat the demons at Atmesta isolated area with the runes of the night star.
We weren't able to monitor all the demons in the prision.{nl}That's why we engraved the symbol of the seal on them so they can't be found.
Well done.{nl}You would be able to enlarge the size of the spirit of Hauberk with these symbols.
So the monsters were after this particular piece?{nl}This is also my first time seeing it.. I guess we should check Gaudeji Altar on the right side as well then.
That's why I lured the demons with the demonic stone..{nl}Those villagers were too hasty.{nl}
We should find out whether that is just a symbol or endowned with some kind of power.{nl}First, I want you to collect the toe nails of Lizardmen from the abandoned grape fields.
Lizardmen are the monsters that appeared a lot after Medzio Diena.{nl}If some kind of power is in this tree, it will definitely react to the toe nails.
Revelator, this is astonishing!{nl}After I put the power of the tree into the toe nails of the monster that you brought, it corroded right away.
Now let's see how this sample will react.{nl}I hope it works out well.. You should also see it, Revelator!
Until my master comes, I will prepare for a large-scale purification.{nl}Can you collect five bottles of Orange Tama body fluid at the Kvie Farm Area for me?
Right now, the bigger problem we have is the monsters, not the bad harvests.
Hey you. Revelator. Don't just look at me. Help me.{nl}Please kick out Lizardmen on my fields.
That's so thankful.{nl}Please get me the leaves that Tama is putting on. I got something to check.
Please look at the lower side of the gravevine at Avarza Grape Farm.{nl}I need the root of it. Please get me three of them.
Please be careful since if you touch the roots accidently, the poison may come out from them.{nl}Or the monsters may come out.{nl}It is a good habit to be careful always.
If that's the case, please eliminate all short trees.{nl}Ah, don't forget to bring the evidence as well. I need something to report.
Are you looking for the druid? Of course I know where he is. {nl}But you know, we soldiers have been collecting rent, and it doesn't seem enough.{nl}
The Stumpy Trees are most irritating.{nl}They are violent, and they also look disgusting.{nl}
Please just defeat the short trees at Zole Farm. {nl}If you could do that, I won't say anything anymore.
Listen. I am really sorry, but I don't have any power.{nl}If you don't mind, could you defeat all the Cysts at Zirta Brewery?
The soldiers want bribes and the supervisor doesn't care at all, even if something happens to us.{nl}The current owner of this farm, Shaton, takes a lot of rent from us.{nl}
I hid them well without being discovered by the soldiers, but there are monsters roaming.{nl}Is it possible for you to retrieve it back for me? It's at the Farm Plaza.
Hey, I will give you some of my commission, so are you interested in doing some work?{nl}It's a simple task, just get all the pink root moles that are across the underground tunnels.
It's you again. As usual, get rid of all the pink root moles across the underground tunnels.{nl}My men don't want to go there because they don't like the underground tunnels.
Please, do continue your work on those moles.{nl}It's almost done, so keep up the good work just little bit more beyond the underground tunnels.
Oh goddesses, What have you done?!{nl}I heard the Glass Mole has appeared near the Wind Vane Tower, and it's because of you! You should be responsible for it!
Do you still think I am the stone in your pocket?..{nl}You think I would be defeated?

I want to help purify the Thorn Forest, but I lack the strength.{nl}Can you eliminate some of the Tree Ghouls bothering the soldiers?
My body continues to feel heavy... It would be nice if he came to purify the baron's farm.
Sir Baron is trying his best to purify this farm. {nl}The workers sometimes say weird stuff but don't mind them.
Everybody's working on the farm. No exceptions.{nl}Ignore all those nonsense rumors. What do those idiots know?{nl}
The baron is busy trying to appease the workers. {nl}Why do they have so much doubt about something they don't know.
The baron is a very good person. {nl}He made a power source with magic that purges his own farm.
Hey. Have you seen a big monster escape? {nl}If it's true, then this is a big problem.
Where the hell did such a big monster go? {nl}This is dangerous...
Ah. Don't worry, it's okay.{nl}Just don't tell anyone about this.
I should've just left it alone... {nl} Ah, I was talking to myself so don't worry.
I mean what the baron is doing should be obvious, but I'm not sure what it is.
The only person here who would carelessly destroy the statue is the baron. Unless he received orders to break the statue.
I'm thinking that it could be something from the original farm that is corrupting it, no?
I wonder what the baron told the Revelator.{nl}Purify? That's ridiculous.
Can you keep this a secret from the others?{nl} 'Cause if this reaches the baron's ears, all will be in vain.
Never listen to anything the baron says.{nl} He's just a greedy old man.
Come... Come on! Give it!
Do not bother the placed food piles.{nl} They should have shuffled over here by now... just keep watching.
My son stole from a pile of food that was mixed with Holy Water.{nl}Over time, all of the curse's energy within him should be released.
Strangely, we always lack manpower. {nl}Of course, the laziness of the workers here adds to it. {nl}
But if the crystal isn't present, it means there is a problem. {nl}You just have to gather the power of monsters with this pot and then bury it near the spell circle.
This is Baron Allerno's farm. {nl}The baron is trying to purify the farm so don't bug him.
This year's harvest is also bountiful and the weather is warm.. {nl}If not for the strange aura, then this would be the best farm.
Huh? You killed it because it tried to eat people? {nl}Ah.. well then, nevermind. I will report it to the baron myself.
If you use the pot near monsters, poison will be collected in the pot. {nl}Give it to me when enough poison is gathered.
Baron Secretary Andol's Journal
The wizard who claimed to have come from the Mage Tower earned the baron's favor. {nl}But I'm sure that wizard is planning something absurd that I don't know much of. {nl}
Is there a wonder medicine for eternal youth and immortality? {nl}Isn't that something only within the domain of the goddess. {nl}What is it that the wizard is trying to get out of tricking the baron. {nl}
He started to suppress the divine aura, calling it strange, and then began to call in an evil aura. {nl}A hole leading to the other world... {nl}All the experiments in the farm were for that hole, betraying the goddess...{nl}
But the baron was already blinded with eternal life and pushed many soldiers into that hole.
I don't know what the baron is working towards. {nl}But I'm sure of one thing, that it is ruining the farm.
I stacked up firewood in front of the magic circle. But it has a protective shield,{nl} so even if you light it, the fire will fade out quickly.{nl}
The only problem is whether the magic circles are good or bad. {nl}At least this is better than kowtowing to the baron.
To do this right, we need to gather all the clues. {nl}Only then can we persuade the tenant farmers.
What do you think? About those magic circles. {nl}Do you think that will really purify our farm?
Does this farm look peaceful to you? {nl}Well then, you are looking at it wrong.
We were able to be fully prepared with your help. {nl}Thank you very much.
Strangely, I feel sluggish and tired... {nl}How about you? Are you okay?
The magic circles have to power up for the spell power source to work properly. {nl}Only then will the portal... I mean the purification will take place.
Oh, this... Hold on.
We have to take care of it before it falls into Naktis' hands. {nl}Please get back the Holy Relic of Salvation from the demons.
But that wasn't easy because of the dimensional crack. {nl}The demons keep crossing over through the dimensional crack.
Zydrone is keeping Blut by all means. {nl}But we don't know how long it will hold with our powers alone.
We have to weaken the Blut's influence. {nl}Please get the Mark of Blut from Blut's aids in Viejauler Basecamp.
By the way, Blut seems to be proud of what happened to Hauberk because of him. {nl}He was in a group that targeted the strongest and Hauberk was at the top of their list. {nl}
Blut thought that he was presumptuous and told that to Giltine. {nl}That is why he was torn by Helgasercle.
You are the one Goddess Vakarine was talking about. {nl}Good work. Eveything will go as Goddess Vakarine plans.
Blut is locked up behind this wall. {nl}Now, we have to take it down at once. Are you ready?
I we didn't take down Blut here, Vakarine would have fallen with it. {nl}Go to Demon Prison 2nd Area. Arune is waiting for you.
The demons that lost Blut are causing a rampage. {nl}If they break the barrier of the Goddess and escape to the outside world, then it will be a great disaster.
Good work. {nl}It's a relief that those demons did not notice the barrier weakening.
Human exploration teams came in from the outside world in the past. {nl}Unfortunately, they died before we could do anything. {nl}
I want to at least find their keepsakes to comfort them. {nl}But it's not easy because the demons took them as trophies.
Kupole Arune
You're here. What a relief you're not late. {nl}The power of Demon Lord Nuaele is about to break the barrier of the goddess. {nl}
Aldona went to fight Nuaele in hopes to last a bit more.
The demons are crossing over through the gap in 1st Isolation Area. {nl}Closing it before Nuaele joins them will be a big help to Aldona.
Great work. {nl}With her force cut off, her vigor will also soften down.
Nuale is using Hauberk's Piece of Seal to entice his servants to join her forces. {nl}We can use that to strengthen Hauberk's powers.
It's to retrieve back the Marks that Hauberk gave his servants. {nl}Go to 2nd Isolation Area. They must be gathered there.
Now Nuaele should feel it herself. {nl}That she can't escape using other's powers.
Hauberk is a demon like them so it will be easy to read their minds. {nl}And it's even easier for souls.
She planned to make this prison her world from the start. {nl}If her plans succeeded, even Goddess Ausrine's powers would not have been enough.
What about striking the Harugals in 4th Isolation Area first? {nl}Getting rid of them will be like getting rid of Nuaele's most powerful weapon.
The Harugals used to be Hauberk's elite servants. {nl}But it was also them who turned over Hauberk's seal fragment to Nuaele.
Nuaele is gone now, but there are still demons that continue her orders. {nl}They will repeat the past unless we retrieve her fragments.
It's the demons in 4th Isolation Area. {nl}Please take what happened last time as a lesson so that this will never happen again in the future. {nl}
Thank you. I will destroy these fragments myself. {nl}May the blessings of the goddess be with you.
Nuaele is currently performing a demon summoning ritual in her territory. {nl}But both of her arms and legs are cut off, so it will be easy to defeat her. {nl}
Vakarine is waiting for your help in 3rd Area. {nl}Go quickly.
Please help Zydrone complete the Evening Star Key. {nl}You can get the power of Dionys with that key.
The power to protect from Valtruss is what is controlling the ego of Dionys. {nl}Fortunately, that power can be removed if the power of the Goddess is put in the Evening Star Key.
First, close the small dimensional cracks in the Scars of Fighting Spirits. {nl}It will be difficult to perform the ritual with the waves of demons coming out from there.
Now go to Oruarma Cathedral. {nl}Protect me from the demons while I put the Goddess' power in the Evening Star Key.
Here. Give this key to Aldona. {nl}He must be blocking Dionys now. Please hurry.
Hurry, the strength of Goddess Vakarine.. {nl}Use the Evening Star Key to release the Rearda, Kasa, and Rada Seals.
We, Kupoles, cannot block Dionys. {nl}Not even Vakarine can do anything if we are late.
We will begin to separate the power of Dionys. {nl}If we fail.. The result will be as if tens of Demon Lords are on the loose. {nl}
We need to approach it with caution. Let me know when you are ready.
Hauberk ran away to the direction of Prison 4th Area, guarded by Daiva. {nl}Please return to the Goddess first. I will take care of Dionys.
You are still here, so it isn't late yet. {nl}The 4th Area he ran to is like a maze. Daiva can easily chase him.
Valtruss is defeated but its servants are still left in Oruarma Cathedral. {nl}I want you to let those demons pay for their sins.
The Grand Hall is where the Goddess recovers her powers. {nl}That is why it should always be safe from the demons. Thank you very much.
Dionys is not recovering well. {nl}I think getting back the claws that have his powers might help him recover.
Dionys was an ordinary creation of the human world. {nl}The goddess took and cared for him when the demons cruelly toyed with him. {nl}
Now, he is the most loyal guardian of Vakarine. {nl}Even though he lost his senses to that power, he must be in pain.
There are many demons that ran away from Dionys' attacks near the Rearda Seal. {nl}Let's just hope that Dionys' claws are still stuck in them.
Once Dionys gets back his strength, Vakarine should also recover. {nl}Aside from that, Dionys has other roles that are indispensable.
Thank you. {nl}This will be of big help to the weakened Dionys.
The barrier in Nebilau Ruins is the weakest so they must be headed there. {nl}Follow it quickly.
The girl who left the sapling, who could it have been?
I just can't leave here knowing I got here through the kindness of Gina Greene. {nl}But the land is contaminated so I'm worried if I have to leave regardless.
Even someone as distant as you helped me, so I should cheer up. {nl}Those druids said they will help me so I should trust them.
I can't stand the corruption anymore. {nl}But at least, it's better than the farm beside us.
Hunt Hauberk's servants at the Internal Separation Plan and gather his Soul Fragments. {nl}Our goal is to gather as much of his soul as we can.{nl}
I know the druids are trying to purify the farm. {nl}I'm just whining because of my frustrations.
The druids are the ones having the hardest time. {nl}At least this area is Gina Greene's land, I wonder what they will do with the farms beside ours.
All the farms I've seen so far were either corrupted by evil aura or full of monsters and can't be recovered. {nl}But I have a good feeling about this place.
Where are you going? {nl}This is Shaton's private land.
Even if you have my permission, you better stay low. {nl}Mr. Shaton is sensitive now with his son's problems.
Even if you have my permission, you have to take care of my men yourself.
Even if you are the Revelator, you better not fool around. {nl}The pollution is not something for you to mind.
A single druid is soiling the whole farm. {nl}I would have kicked him out immediately, if it wasn't for Gina Greene.
This area is owned by the son of the Shaton family. {nl}Although, it is run by Shaton himself now.
The degree of corruption in this farm is too much. {nl}Ellie better know what's she's doing..
I have no idea how I will persuade the owner of Shaton. {nl}I've heard that he is really stubborn.
Clearly, the farm is very different from before. {nl}What could have happened?
Tenant Farmer Weiss
Even if Shaton changes his mind now, it's too late for me. {nl}Unless some miracle by the goddess happens, how can this insane amount of corruption be purified?
The corruption is getting worse and worse. {nl}I don't know how to persuade him anymore.. I just hope he'll listen to you.{nl}
Now he's trying to escape using the body of his servant. {nl}Let's look for him by getting rid of the demons that contain Hauberk. Until he gives up.
Your lead was a big help. {nl}I wonder if this is all the guidance of the goddess..
I plan to study the mysterious seedlings from now on. {nl}A wide range of purification, isn't that wonderful?
This farm belongs to my son. {nl}I will protect it until my son returns.
That druid sure is noisy. {nl}What does he know, to keep on talking..
I thought this farm would be able to replace my son. {nl}Now.. I have to let go.
Please tell the druid that I am sorry. {nl}I'm sure my daughter will take good care of the rest.
I'm sorry. There is nothing more I can say. {nl}If only my brother was alive..
I'm glad that he seems to have returned to his former self. {nl}Do you believe my brother made it to the hands of the goddess safely?
I'm going to give up grape farming and improve the treatment of the tenant farmers. {nl}I think my brother would have done the same.
I'm fine as long as the owner pays me but I'm sure others have gone crazy because of the evil aura. {nl}Growing grapes in a contaminated farm that no one can eat.
Everyone has their own story, don't they? {nl}Sir Shaton, and this farm too.
Thanks for a while ago. {nl}I didn't want to stay in that terrible place any longer.
Maybe the druids were right. {nl}We don't really have to go through all this if we can purify the farm, right?
Some weird sacks keep coming from other farms. {nl}But we have orders from the baron so we have to clean them up.
I really don't know anything about it. {nl}A man, inside? They must have gotten something wrong.
Since that day, the demons have become those that deserve to die.
What a mess.{nl} Back then, I have carried out orders like this handling the sacks. I really don't know what happened.
The dimensional crack belongs to you.{nl} Please deal with the other demon souls.
Did you see something strange? {nl} Don't mind it. The baron will handle everything.
I have never seen an evil aura on the farm, why does my body feel so heavy? {nl}Is it really like the baron says, because of the strange aura...?
Demon Lord Hauberk.. His final days were dismal as he was torn and betrayed.
Even though the large dimensional crack has disappeared, there are still a lot of demons who came in from there.{nl}We will correct the mistakes of the past.
Recently, I got sick and drowsy.{nl}It seems the crops are not better than last year.
What can I say. I don't hate the soldiers and the crops aren't bad...{nl}But somehow, I don't feel good.
Thank you.{nl}We will collect the sealed Hauberk's power and take it to the goddess.{nl}
The goddess is waiting for you to Prison District 5.{nl}Let's move on.
We don't know whether the goddess is okay or not, but we need to show them a sample.{nl}Can you collect the Demon's Tooth in Hradeti Crossroads?
Hauberk...{nl}His life is too pitiful, but it should be removed.{nl}
Well. We came here because of you.{nl}We are holding the ceremony to close the corrupted gap, you need to be completely ready.
Receive this Evening Star Rune.{nl}Let's collect the Demon's Soul to use it and collected corrupted gap.
You have to go to the Rankina Isolation District, Ishsula Broken District and Hehmastar Isolation District.{nl}If you defeat the demon by using the Evening Star Rune, we can save the soul.
I also want you to collect the demons' Sealing Tokens at the Hehmastar Isolation District.{nl}Those wield a large amount of power as well.
It's obviously true that all demons should be defeated.{nl}Ever since Medzio Diena, the demons can never be forgiven.
It's not allowed for humans to enter. {nl}But, you are allowed by the goddess.
I was waiting for you by Aldona's orders.{nl}But, please hold on a bit as I'm still not ready.
Though the Demon Lord has disappeared, peace is not meant to come to this place.{nl}Only by defeating all of the demons will true peace come.
This demon prison is not related with any world...{nl}A new disaster would befall upon the human world, if these areas fall to the demons.
Dionys... He is one of the beings who knows Vakarine.{nl}So, He can endure the pain himself.{nl}
The goddess' barrier should be complete if Vakarine recovers quickly.{nl}Until then, the corrupted gap appears continuously.
This prison has been made by Goddess Ausrine.{nl}Vakarine regularly visited to check here.
Even the Kupoles won't be able to take care of Dionys.{nl}Quickly, please complete the Evening Star Key.
Is the Evening Star Key still not ready?
Oh..my poor Dionys..I'm so sorry for giving you this big burden.
Revelator. You cannot close the dimensional cracks unless you can get Dionys back.{nl}I ask you in the name of the goddess for him.
Hauberk... I'm expecting it already.
I could not say the truth because you were close with Hauberk.{nl}Please forgive me.
Hauberk is also sinner.{nl}You don't need to be sympathetic.
I only learned it from you...{nl}That we should have listened to Laima's warning from the very beginning.
There were many sacrifices.{nl}The damage of the prison is still deep as an effect of the dimensional crack.
Good job.{nl}Let's use this symbol to increase Hauberk's soul.
It's almost ready.{nl}I ask you to please do it, while me and Kupole are closing the corrupted gap.
Ever since we closed the dimensional crack, the demons have been assembling.{nl}But I'm powerless to move...{nl}
In the future, the demons must never be allowed to gather in the same place.{nl}Defeat the demons in Vanaga Monitor District.
Demons are trying to expand their power using the disaster spirit.{nl}Even after overcoming the current disaster, the peace is still far away.
The crack will open again if we, the Kupoles, don't keep our eyes on it.{nl}I hope that we can find the Goddess Laima as soon as possible...
I've been hearing that Dionys is in pain due to his slow recovery.{nl}Can you collect some empty souls from the demons in Pasaru Isolation District?
If Dionys recovers completely, the goddess can reduce the burden.
Thank you.{nl}If Dionys recovers completely, It's because of you.
The small dimensional cracks are again been carving away at us.{nl}But we don't know why because now we're focusing on the stabilization.
Can you deal with the corrupted gap in Gavara Isolation District?
We really owe you one.
Thank you.{nl}I will make sure I do everything possible to prevent another dimensional crack.
How long can Aldona keep this up...
If Vakarine had received the Laima's warning in advance...{nl}Would the situation be better than what it is now?
I received land from Gytis, but it's infested.{nl}The Ridimeds are the problem, but what can I do with just a hoe and pick?
With the demons being unhindered by the weakening seal...{nl} And the villagers' thirst for action, we could be inviting disaster.
For now, we can compose ourselves a bit.{nl}Sorry for the late welcome, I am Goddess Austeja's priest Raeli.{nl}
Goddess Austeja has sealed sources of evil energy at two locations.{nl}However, the seals are getting weakened by the continuous attacks from the demons.
How can you.. there are hidden monsters.{nl}But, It's really good you are okay.
The story of that mysterious girl...{nl}We don't know if it is a clue to purifying this land.
This farm's owner is Gina Greene.{nl}They kindly lend this farm to us who lost the land since Medzio Diena.
I'm getting annoyed.{nl}I want the druids to defeat the monsters, but they are just looking at that tree.
Klaipeda is trying to increase its food distribution rate.{nl}With the goddesses gone, we don't expect a great outcome.
That's really appreciated.{nl}Firstly, collect the remains of Tama. I have something to check.
Strange. I assumed this wouldn't yield anything, but these actually seem mixed with earth's aura.{nl}In order to know more, we need something strongly exposed to the earth's aura here. Can you help me?
Please take some roots of the grapevines at Avarza Grape Farm.{nl}Three roots will probably be enough.
Be careful, poison can spray out if you handle it wrong.{nl}Hidden monsters might also appear.
Well. Some sort of holy aura is spreading across the ground.{nl}Thanks to your efforts, we might not give up on this farm after all.{nl}
Nevertheless, I don't know exactly what this aura is.{nl}It's too weak. Maybe the druids could know something.
No matter what you have planned, If you don't have any permission, It is better for you to leave from here.
What? Whoever you are, you cannot enter here.{nl}However, depending on what you can do... I can allow it, Do you get me?
I swear somebody's guilty of embezzlement, but I can't find evidence. {nl}It should be a brown bag of grain. If you see one, take it quickly and return to me.
Did you see the people who have been infected by the poison?{nl}The soldiers said that place is near...
Get back here as soon as you're done defeating the Stumpy Trees at Zole Farmland.{nl}I won't ask for anything more if you can do this.
He's surely out of his mind, ordering us to pick the spoiled grape vines.{nl}The missing son of the Shaton family must be the reason...
Please spray this potion at the grape vines. Don't let the soldiers see you.
The monsters appear near the bush.{nl}More monsters appear by shaking it.
I am almost done.{nl}I am going to move to the suburbs of Klaipeda, because I've heard they're looking for tenant farmers there.
Defeating the monsters will only temporary help. Those monsters will come again soon.{nl}But how can I think like that in a situation like this?
Shaton is just too stubborn.{nl}But even if I know how he feels...
I'm sorry, but if you don't have any business here then please leave this farm.{nl}If my father is angry with you, you might be kicked out.
Even though the demons attack here, I will never run away from this place.
You have 'ideas' too?{nl}Get out. I don't want to hear it.
I will believe my master even though he has made a wrong choice.
If it weren't for the money, I would never work on a spooky farm like this.{nl}It would be too much for me.
So you're here to put me back in your little pocket eh..{nl}Don't make me laugh. There is nothing to discuss between us!
From the beginning, all of you were the same...{nl}I have been fooled.{nl}
But, can you stand against my current form now?!

Our comrades who were attacked by the Petrifying Frost weeks ago are here. {nl}We did not receive support after the world turned like this so we had no choice but to leave them and wait. {nl}But the monsters are now attacking those that are petrified. Those damn monsters!
To block the source of danger, we have to strike them before they make their move. {nl}Go to Drasos Chapel Ruins and defeat them.
We have to go to Ruklys base in the Fortress of the Land, in order to get detailed information. {nl}But the Royal Army is blocking the entrance. We can't get in. {nl}Though there is a way around..
I'm a wizard who can't use magic. I feel pathetic.
Antares... He used to be a great wizard.
I can't return like this...
My mission... My brother...
He made the traps very meticulously even when he was not in his right mind. {nl}I hated him even when he was sane.
Find the last valve in the central control room. {nl}If we destroy this, it will be safe no matter what Antares does.
That night... I hid in the grass and watched everything. {nl}In the end, everyone pointed their weapons at each other. And to think they were such close friends before..{nl}
I realized after death that my colleagues' betrayals were because of the curse. {nl}This thing is now useless to me... Thank you.
A monster in disguise as Goddess Statue. I pity the souls. {nl}Now the souls may rest in peace. This is all thanks to you.
They made the tower such a mess. This is unforgivable.
You better be careful. {nl}Why do you fathom the wizards once loyal here ran away?
We can help Goddess Gabija if we have the Jewel of Prominence.
With the Transport Magic Circles destroyed, we'll have to go floor by floor.
I think I can remember something... But first, it's important to go to the goddess.
Uhg, my head aches... {nl}Maybe it's because of Antares...
We can only assume that the monsters were drawn to the magic circle. {nl}The magic circle is pressing down the divine power of the altar... something like that.
Rashly approaching the magic circle will only hurt you. {nl}Be sure to destroy the magic circle using the Magic Stone of Blessings.
Have you seen the sacks of grain the monsters stole from me? {nl}Please get me back my sacks of grain. I have to pay the farm rent.
{nl}If that doesn't happen, we have no choice but to stand up againt the plundering body. {nl}Moreover, the plundering process destroys the authority of the goddess and if the objective of plunder is human's greed over something, then it is something to be angry about.
So the Chapparition was behind the curse. {nl}Naktis' curse alone was more than enough already. That's a relief. {nl}
This is another separated space, neither the world of humans nor demons. {nl}The demons who are harmful to the world are imprisoned here. {nl}
Demons are crossing over through the gap in 1st Isolation Area. {nl}It will be of great help to Aldona if you can block them before they join Nuaele.

The goddess had to make a painful decision. {nl}Dionys was like family but she decided to seal the power in him until the prison stabilizes.
Hauberk ran towards 4th Demon Prison which is protected by Daiva. {nl}First, you should return to the goddess. I will look after Dionys.
We got Hauberk but now his servants are the problem. {nl}We don't know what they will do.
Thank you. {nl}If Dionys recovers well, it will be all thanks to you.
The Curse of Gluttony prevents you from digesting food when you eat it. {nl}That's why it makes you hungry all the time. {nl}
We just need to exterminate all the monsters that interfere with the making of the route to the Gateway of the Great King.
I heard that the hardness and the elasticity of the wood sticks of Firent at Nefritas Cliff is good.{nl}You can get the rope to tie those sticks from Red Pantos Archers. Please get me those first.
Our only way right now is to find a solution to each curse one by one. {nl}Just like how every sickness has a different cure.
Thank you for everything until now but I can't leave my family to starve... {nl}I have no choice but to leave if the evil energy stays in the garden.
This is the vineyard of my brother.{nl}My father runs it for him. {nl}

The baron is trying his best to purify this farm. {nl}The workers sometimes say weird stuff but don't mind them.
It would be best if I went myself, but I'm in no position to leave my place now. {nl}Please purify the sanctum using this Holy Water for now. {nl}
I want to see my son healthy soon. {nl}It's a pain waiting for him to spit out the energy of the evil curse.
It's all the same for farmers and soldiers. {nl}One side works and the other manages it.
The power source needs nature's strength,{nl}and what would be the most suitable for that at the moment?{nl}The crops that fill the warehouse.
Even if what the baron really wants is purification. {nl}It doesn't mean we need to bear losing colleagues and expensive farm rent fees. {nl}
Lastly.. The monsters constantly preying on the food storage is a problem. {nl}There is a fellow guarding that place, but it's dangerous all the time.

Hunter Tracker Capt. Mintz
What a pain in the ass.{nl} How do we convince those monks...
Hey you, have you ever seen the one called Ebonypawn?
I hope this that was the end of it.{nl}It seems that we Hunters have a bad reputation around these parts.
Are things going smoothly?{nl}I'm hoping to hear good things in the near future.
Please help our Natasha.{nl}She's a good girl, if a bit inexperienced...
Hopefully this can be resolved without causing a conflict with the monks.{nl}I trust you in taking this matter appropriately.
For the most part, do try and appease the monk's demands.{nl}We'll assist you wherever we can.
I'm glad to hear that Natasha is doing well.{nl} I wish you the best at Raoki Swamps.
Good. So finally the time to retrieve the monastery.{nl}We will be using our power in a such a long time.
We've reached this far with your help, Revelator.{nl}Now we just to have to hope that Ebonypawn gets taken care of well. Let's go.
Senior Monk Potos
What brought you here?{nl}With the circumstances not heading to the way they used to be, we will try our best to help you.
I am sorry if you've come here to visit the monastery.{nl}We are like this since the monsters rushed in.
The goddesses have taught us to greet everyone with warmth.{nl}Due to the difficulty we are having at the moment, we weren't able to greet the Hunters warmly. I regret this..
If that trap was set up by Ebonypawn, I will stand by the Hunters' side.{nl}Whatever excuses you make, they cannot be compared with the pain of our brothers.
Brother Marko is at Viltis Forest and Goss is at Laukyme Swamp.{nl}Without their support, it is impossible to persuade the abbot.
I support the Hunters, but I don't know what the other senior monks are thinking.{nl}However, I don't think it would be a problem if we get hard evidence.
Monk Wiley
My heart aches to see my brothers suffer in pain.{nl}I am doing my best to take care of them, but I am somewhat scared.
For me, my brothers come first instead of the Hunters or the monastery.{nl}I am praying to the goddesses, so that they can recover as soon as possible.{nl}
Hunter Reina
You should be careful when you are crossing this forest.{nl}There are traps everywhere.
You don't seem like a monk... Do you know anything about Ebonypawn?{nl}I heard they created a mess near the farm in Klaipeda.
Even after taking this antidote, the paralysis doesn't fade away.{nl}But, as a Hunter, I cannot go back until I finish my task.
I don't know how many people are suffering because of Ebonypawn.{nl}To put this in other words, Ebonypawn is 'so great'.
Senior Monk Marko
The abbot is trapped in the monastery, where it is full of monsters, but mentioning Ebonypawn..{nl}They shouldn't be that rude. Don't you think so?
If you are going to talk about the Hunters, I refuse to listen.{nl}They are rude people.
He barely walked here and then fainted.{nl}I think he is breathing for now...
Boros! Wake up, Boros!
I regret that I was being so harsh to the Hunters until now.{nl}I hope my decision helps the Hunters.
You should persuade Goss at Laukyme Swamp.{nl}But, since you don't have the decisive proof about Ebonypawn... I can't guarantee the withdrawl of the protection.
Hunter Natasha
Persuading someone is so hard.{nl}I hope someone helps me...
I wonder how Captain Mintz would react if he was in my situation..
Help whatever you could on what they are trying to do.{nl}We, Hunters would help as well.
I should have suggested to help retrieving the monastery from the first place.{nl}I wasn't patient.
I will take care for him so don't worry too much, but go to Laukyme Swamp.
You can go to Laukyme Swamp by going up Glade Hillroad again.{nl}Please report to Hunter Tracker Capt. Mintz on your way back.
Hunter Bastille
Are you heading to Tyla Monastery?{nl}The monsters there are already worshiping.
Careless, careless.{nl}I was so careless...
Monk Chad
Please do not get close to those Hunters.{nl}They are incredibly rude people.
I don't like the Hunters at all.{nl}I hope they wouldn't change their minds because we are protecting Ebonypawn.
Senior Monk Goss
If you are the pilgrim who came to see Tyla Monastery, I am so sorry.{nl}We lost the place to the monsters...
I don't know what the goddesses would say if she sees this...{nl}Gloomy...
This is all I know about Ebonypawn.{nl}I think there weren't anything special besides that.
If you need to more about Ebonypawn, please ask me anytime.{nl}I will answer everything I know about Ebonypawn.
Finally, we are near Tyla Monastery.{nl}We want to attack, but we should also think about the monks.
To defeat Ebonypawn, we will do anything.{nl}To the ones who are from the tower of the stars, Ebonypawn is a such creature.
Monk Jones
The moment now seems like a short nightmare.{nl}We were studying scriptures and drawing water at the monastery not long ago.
I know that I am pathetic since I was forced out by the monsters...{nl}But, I am worried more about the abbot who is praying at the prayer room without knowing anything.
Monk Jeffrey
A long time ago, this forest used to be completely packed with thorns just like Sirdgela Forest.{nl}After the purification, we all thought the monsters were eliminated.. But that was just an illusion.
I just want to know where all these monsters came from.{nl}After the purification, the only monsters were the ones that lost their ways.
Hey! Wake up!{nl}Can you hear my voice?
He is fainted, but fortunately he is breathing.{nl}But, the fracture is serious.
Ebonypawn, you cheap...
Fortunatly, his inner organs seem alright.{nl}But, I can't cure him by transporting him to other places.
I am going to take care of the outer edge of the monastery.{nl}In the name of the goddesses, I wish you the good luck.
We are all ready here.{nl}Although I can't participate in saving the abbot, I will do my best here.
The prayer room where the abbot is located is safe.{nl}But, we should save him anyways.
Our preparations are done here.{nl}If you are ready, tell Goss.
You will act with me and Goss.{nl}If you are finished, tell Goss.
Hunters can move whenever they want.{nl}I will do my best for the first time in a long time.
Moheim is smart so he should've hid the crystal sphere well.
You can't open it outside without the crystal sphere.{nl}Unless the abbot opens it himself...
It's so good to hear that you are okay.{nl}While you are getting the crystal sphere, we should get ready to rescue the abbot.
I would've bled a lot if it weren't you.{nl}The goddesses must have helped me.
Fortunately, the abbot seems to know nothing.{nl}I guess that's better. Anyways, the issues have been resolved.
I am less worried to find out the abbot is okay.{nl}Now what should we do about Ebonypawn...
I am discussing with the abbot.{nl}Please wait beside Mintz for a while.
We haven't finished discussing yet.{nl}Please wait little more.
You will leave soon. May the goddesses bless you.{nl}Come to Tyla Monastery sometimes.
I regret a bit since we should have allied together in the first place.{nl}I guess I forgot the lessons of the goddesses for a while.
It is so fortunate that the abbot is okay.{nl}I... feel like crying.
I kinda expected that he would be alright since he was in the prayer room...{nl}But seeing him okay with my own eyes comforts me more.
Please wait beside Mintz for a while.{nl}I should explain everything so it may take little time.
I've heard about Ebonypawn's letter from Goss.{nl}Please wait little more since everything fits the situation.
We've retrieved the monastery and the Hunters fulfilled what they wanted...{nl}These are all blessings of the goddesses.
Without your help, I am sure that it would've not gone so easy.{nl}I've heard the stories of many Revelators before, but you are the only one I saw in person.
Monk Moheim
It's so good that we've retrieved the monastery...{nl}But it's a mess.
Should we get rid of the monsters first or clean this place first...{nl}That's the problem we are facing at the moment.
Now is the best chance to get Ebonypawn.{nl}We are surrounding the monastery so I guess even he would not be able to sneak out.
You saw Ebonypawn?{nl}He is not here. We better go down a bit more.
Please pray so that we could get Ebonypawn.{nl}I wish you the good luck.
Don't worry Revelator. Just go on your way. The people here are just fainted temporarily.{nl}I hope to see you next time for something better instead of Ebonypawn.
I lost many colleagues from Petrifying Frost here.{nl}I don't understand why I am here to support a newbie Chronomancer here.
On top of that, we don't know when those violent monsters would attack here.{nl}I don't care what you do, I just hope those monsters get taken care of.
We are still sad that we lost our colleagues.{nl}It is very unfortunate that we should take care of that woman in this time.
Thanks. We can stay safe here for some time.
Our comrades who were attacked by Petrifying Frost... they are just left there without avoiding the rain and the wind.{nl}On top of that, we have a limited support... We have no choice, but to wait.{nl}
But those damn monsters! They are attacking our colleagues.{nl}Please. Could you be with our colleagues to protect them for a while?
My old friend, Galen is one of the victims.{nl}Please protect him.
Thank you so much.{nl}I hope the reinforcement comes soon so he could return to his family even if he is petrified.
We didn't treat them badly, but they betrayed us.{nl}Dico Thieves stole the supplies from us.{nl}
They must have taken them to Drasos Chapel Ruins, but since I can't leave this place, I guess we all gonna die.{nl}I am sorry, but can you retrieve the supplies that were stolen by the thieves?
A few decades ago, the thieves attacked the guard camp or stole the supplies secretly.{nl}They were punished for doing so, but I guess they forgot about it.
They lured us in front of them and stole the goods from behind.{nl}We should set something up, but our chiefs are fighting against the Knights of Kaliss. {nl}
We have one more trouble.{nl}I mean Sabina, who is a Knight of Kaliss.{nl}
They are insisting that they would not go back until they find the damaged artifacts.{nl}We can't get out from this place so I don't know what they want us to do...
The city that was destroyed a few hundreds years ago has no assets or no people to protect.{nl}I rather feel like protecting a historical site. Even tomb thieves are here.
Now, I just hope Sabina stays calm.{nl}We don't want to be like them here because of the Petrifying Frost.
It's not an easy thing to ditch the Royal Army guards.{nl}I want to know the truth here. The truth which the soldiers really hate about.{nl}
I need your help since you don't seem to belong to any side.{nl}Could you make rubber copies of the records that are remaining here?
These are the records from the time when the Fortress of the Land collapsed.{nl}We could maybe know more about the Fortress of the Land from the headquarter of Ruklys.
But, the Fortress of the Land can't be entered because the Royal Army guards are restricting the access.{nl}Even the Knights of Kaliss.{nl}
Maybe... we could restore the time of the portal that was used when we retreated from the Fortress of the Land.{nl}It is dangerous from this point on so if you are going to quit, please tell me now.
What we are planning right now could lead us to the gallows.{nl}Please keep it secret.
When we were in the era of Premier Eminent, we were supported by the superior troops, lots of supplies and etc.{nl}But, 600 years have passed after Premier Eminent died.{nl}
No matter how large the rebellion was, after experiencing Medzio Diena, our support waned. If anything, it's a question of whether we must remain here. For 600 years?
I heard the Dico Thieves were well known thieves.{nl}I heard that they were separated on Medzio Diena... Anyways... what they are doing is like what bandits are doing.{nl}
I also know that there are thieves called Amanda Thieves. They were quiet.{nl}I want to know if they really exist or not since I never saw them before.{nl}
Both of them are criminals that we should catch when we receive more reinforcements.{nl}Especially, Dico Thieves.
We are observing what the researchers of the Knights of Kaliss are doing, and while pretending to be their guards.{nl}Sabina was one of them.{nl}
They disappear and appear again using the artifacts that are remaining in the city so I have troubles chasing after them.{nl}But, were Chronomancers the people who investigate the portals?{nl}
I really appreciate for your kindness, but it's not going to be easy. If it was easy, we would've found them already.{nl}I don't know why, but the monsters ate the artifacts.
This place is the cursed city of the traitor, Ruklys.{nl}It has been cursed with the Petrifying Frost since the end of the rebellion.{nl}
We will permit your entry since the Knights of Kaliss requested us to do so,{nl}but please remain at places where we can keep an eye on you.
I don't know how great you were in the past,{nl}but you have to follow the rules of the kingdom here.
Benas asked us to secure the route that connects to the Fortress of the Land.{nl}Ah, he is the ruler of the kingdoms soldiers in this region.{nl}
If you could defeat the monsters in the ruins, that will be the way to contribute to the goddesses and the kingdom.{nl}Of course, I promise you some rewards in return.{nl}
It will not be bad to show us a good impression.{nl}Because this land is ruled by the Royal Army guards.
It wasn't done by the thieves. We are moving the objects to places where they could be utilized.{nl}It will be way better than them disappearing from here.
Not bad.{nl}I guess the rumors don't always get exaggerated.
We are activating the detectors here because of irregular Petrifying Frost that are blowing,{nl}but, there are no soldiers who could check that due to a recent battle.{nl}
So if you could do that for us, that will show us {nl}your loyalty to the kingdom and continue our efforts.
There are monsters who try to go after the soldiers who maintain the device.{nl}Be careful.
The Petrifying Frost are to be blown from the two places.{nl}I heard you are a quite famous Revelator. Aren't you?{nl}
From some time ago, more soldiers are being attacked by Sparnashorn near the detectors.{nl}If you are the one from the rumor, you would be able to face against that monster.{nl}
Those soldiers are the ones who survived the Petrifying Frost and Sparnashorn.{nl}They can't fight against Sparnashorn since they paralyzed from fear. {nl}In this state they have no chance of defeating Sparnashorn.
The Petrifying Frost has been delayed a bit.{nl}Whatever we do, there is no way to block the punishments that were brought by Ruklys.
Now the only thing that remains is Sparnashorn... Defeat it quickly and get out of there.{nl}Even a great Revelator like you can not withstand the Petrifying Frost.
Retreating is also a tactic, but we can't always do it.{nl}We should finish it when we have an volunteer who is loyal and competent like you.
Hearing that it was defeated is the most hopeful story I've heard in years. {nl}Now I better let the troops rest first and tell them the good news.
Although I don't know you, I am glad to see you.{nl}It's good to be acquainted with someone here. Everyone should help each other out.{nl}
For example, help cleaning the monsters at our workplace.{nl}The gathering place. What do you think? Can you help us?
The kind of work I do is business secret so I can't tell you what it is... {nl}No one owns these things anyway. Finders keep them if them if they need them.
That fast? Have you not missed any of the monsters?{nl}Ahah. Those coward Royal Army guards won't get near here so don't worry.
You want to know how I got here? {nl}It's all because I have connections. There are some Royal Army guards who buy claws of the monsters to raise their work records.{nl}
But actually, I don't want to be around those monsters. Especially here.{nl}If you could get me those claws, we will become really good friends.
I think you are misunderstanding something.{nl}We are archaeologists, not thieves.
Thank you so much friend.{nl}Though this seems quite polished.
I will tell you something. You better not think about getting something here.{nl}Aside from us, there is the outrageous Dico Thieves.{nl}
I don't want to see them more than those Royal Army guards.{nl}The goods they brought here from outside are piled up at the entrance route of the outer wall... {nl}What would occur if they all disappear?
I took a sneak peek, but it seems they haven't returned yet.{nl}Move fast.
Seems like Dico Thieves are planning to do their business bigger than I thought. {nl}That's an enormous amount. Do you think they also have connections with the Royal Army?
The terrible scene you can see in this city are the results of the rebellion that was carried out by Ruklys and the citizens 600 years ago.{nl}The Petrifying Frost that started to blow after suppressing the rebellion turn everything into stones.{nl}
The kingdom would've been destroyed already if Premier Eminent wasn't present.{nl}If he was still alive... We may have got over these hard times sooner.
That's the scary wind that turns everything into stones.{nl}After Medzio Diena, the occurrence of the wind varied irregularly.{nl}
Once you encounter the curse of the Petrifying Frost, you can't restore it.{nl}The sin of the traitor, Ruklys is that heavy.{nl}
The Knights of Kaliss is trying to find a remedy...{nl}The curse continued for 600 years. I don't think there's a remedy.
Sparnashorn appears with the wind of Petrifying Frost.{nl}To avoid the exhausted soldiers not get involved with it, we should avoid them fighting against Sparnashorn.{nl}
If we could eliminate the weak Petrifying Frost with this absorbing scroll at the great square, we may delay the time a bit.{nl}We would be able to lure Sparnashorn to the old market when the next Petrifying Frost blow.
I've a friend who's supposed to come here but he's nowhere to be found.{nl}I think something happened.
He is hiding among the guards near the great square.{nl}This water bottle has a code on it. If you give it to the guards, he'll know and talk to you.
He is hiding among the guards.{nl}This water bottle has a code on it. If you give it to the guards, he'll know and talk to you.
Hush! Lower your voice. It will be the end of both of us if we get caught.{nl}Did that stupid Hubertas send you here?{nl}
I told him many times that I'd go back if I'm done with my work here.{nl}There is a big problem here actually.
Our family can't come into the city from outside.{nl}We can't bring in my family without the troops knowing.{nl}
I'm going to make big fuss at the great square. I'm going to call in Saltistter that are roaming around the area. {nl}In order to do this, you need to gather scented stone powder from the monsters. Can you do it?
Our families should have passed this place earlier than the Royal Army. {nl}But Retia hurried things when the Petrifying Frost swept by some time ago so we weren't able to.
If you pour this here, you will soon see the Saltistter show up its huge body itself.{nl}But that is not our plan.
We should not make this place a battlefield. Then our families can't pass through.{nl}Let's rub this powder onto the Rambears that appear at the great square.{nl}
Then Saltistter will attack Rambears. {nl}Retia will not just stand and watch her area be invaded like that.
Our families come from various areas.{nl}I was also once a junior officer with dreams to become a strategist.{nl}
Of course, it was before the area I was assigned to completely disappeared from the map on Medzio Diena.
Did you use everything?{nl}Then now it's time to get busy!
Go to Retia and tell her that Saltistter is coming here.{nl}She won't believe it but I can already feel the Saltistter running at us. {nl}Hurry!
You just have to tell her that Saltistter is coming.{nl}There is no reason for her to suspect us.
Our families passed through this place without any problems.{nl}Since you are still being trusted by our Royal Army guards, you will not be discovered.{nl}
This city... you will find many interesting truths if you continue your journey in this area.{nl}And you may also meet our families.
I don't want to be here either.{nl}I would not be here if I didn't receive the orders to support the Knights of Kaliss...{nl}
Kostas has not come back for days so I can't leave this place.{nl}Also the monsters are running wild so I can't just stay still.
We have to be here until Kostas comes back.{nl}There are lot of things to do, so I hope he comes back soon.
The officers don't like the Knights of Kaliss. {nl}As for lower rank guards like me, the Knights of Kaliss give us supplies and supports so there's no reason for us to hate them.
If we can find the Symbol of Silt, then we would be able to enter the area without any problems.
I can't hear anything from Kostas.{nl}Ah... I don't know how I should report.
The Royal Army guards, the Knights of Kaliss, and we grave robbers are forming an excellent balance.{nl}That's why people can at least walk around.. Before that, this place was not a place to stay.
Much of the city remained in its original form 600 years after the misfortune due to Petrifying Frost.{nl}One of my missions here is to clear the records of rebels remaining here.{nl}
I can't leave my post since Kostas is not here.{nl}You can find many records if you look around the trade area so I want you to take care of them.
Don't mind what's written on the records. {nl}It's all nonsense.
I have to escort, clean up, and guard. I wonder how they are expecting me to do everything alone. {nl}It's a good thing you came to help.
It is an old story,{nl}but many Royal Army guards came to this place to do a preliminary check to support for the research on the Knights of Kaliss.{nl}
But, unlike their expectations, the Petrifying Frost were waiting for them.{nl}They died there... I want to get their keepsakes, but it's hard...
The authorities do not take it well that tens of soldiers were sacrificed for support activities. {nl}That's why the Royal Army and the Knights of Kaliss have become distant.
Good thing I was off duty that day.. I don't even want to think about it.{nl}I will deliver this to the families of the deceased.
Gofden...{nl}The Silt Certificate... Ah sorry I talked alone in front of you.{nl}When you are carrying this, you will not receive the curse of the Petrifying Frost. Don't you think that's amazing?{nl}
People say you go around to save the world according to the will of the goddess?{nl}Then you could also save this city!
Our employer does not support us any other funds besides the research funds to revive the city.{nl}That's why the wizards like me, who want to come up with some results are researching while avoiding the eyes of the Royal Army guards and the Knights of Kaliss.
This will be enough.{nl}Good. Let's combine this with the Symbol of Silt.
We've succeeded the combination... but I can't predict how effective this would be.{nl}I will give you the Symbol of Silt so try using it on the monsters in this area.
If it's effective, then something would react to it.{nl}Maybe since the effects for the Petrifying Frost disappeared, it could take little faster. Anyways, I am counting on you.
Since I handed over the Symbol of Silt to you, I am gonna be dead when the Petrifying Frost blow here.{nl}Please finish the task as quickly as possible.
So it was effective right?{nl}Then now, I will amplify it!
Ah... I almost forgot.{nl}Even if I amplify the Symbol of Silt with the reacting stone, the power doesn't last eternally.{nl}
Good, good... I will activate it only when the Petrifying Frost blow.{nl}I should obtain the detector somewhere.
If you could bring me the detector, I will do the rest.{nl}You've contributed a lot in this experiment so I will give you the effects of the Symbol of Silt.{nl}Although it would not last long...
There were experiments in the past.{nl}At Roxona Reconstruction Agency, there was a separate laboratory to research on the curse of the Petrifying Frost.{nl}
But then demons rushed in...{nl}Most of them were killed by the demons or became petrified on the experimental devices.{nl}
This Symbol of Silt... it reminds me of many things.{nl}It was too bad since the results of the experiments were appearing at that time.
They told me to protect the objects that are gathered at Gerove Workshop Site.{nl}Do you think this makes sense? Why don't they ask the monsters to protect it instead?{nl}
Ah! We should just do it like that.{nl}Hey, could you help me a bit?
It's a good thing the cowardly Dico Thieves did not reach here yet.{nl}Things are limited but people are coming in flocks to take them away..
If it's cleared up that much, then looks like I can start already.
There are some boxes that our thieves left at Gerove Workshop.{nl}When you rub Velas Grass onto them, the monsters would rush in.{nl}
But, you gotta be careful.{nl}The monsters would not treat you preciously so run away after attacking them a little.
I think I can leave this place for a while because of you.{nl}
You haven't seen Dico Thieves right?{nl}In fact, I haven't seen them as well, but Amanda told you to be careful.
Please take care of the monsters in the military district while I prepare the test. {nl}We should not be caught or interfered.
It's relatively safe on top of the fortress.{nl}There are monsters and thieves swarming if you leave this place.{nl}Of course, the Royal Army guards as well.
I don't like it, having to guard here with the Knights of Kaliss around.{nl}You will never understand what it feels like to guard here.
Until now, I am sure that you've only seen the artifacts that stopped their time.{nl}But, it will be different from this point on since I came here.
I will proceed the test from up here.{nl}Please go to the portal and activate it.
Don't worry too much.{nl}Everything is just your memories at then so they won't do any harms to you.
I am sorry. Aren't you hurt somewhere?{nl}I didn't know it would go over my expectations.{nl}
What was that... demons? Are they really demons?{nl}I have no way of knowing. I guess I will have to tune up the portal that leads to the Fortress of the Land.
It is little dangerous... but, I want to suggest a deal to you.{nl}We are actually cooperating with Amanda thieves. Yes. I know it's insane.{nl}
To obtain what you want, you should take this risk.{nl}Just help Amanda thieves to enter into the city.
Would dead people come back if the curse is cured in this city?{nl}No, but the times after now are more important.
We feel like we are risking our lives every seconds.{nl}But we continuously watch over so that nothing will go wrong.
We're different from those Dico Thieves.{nl}If you help well this time, I will surely pay you back someday.
The guards were asking what the fuss was all about so I told them about you. {nl}Everything should be alright.{nl}
If you watch over the city from here, it feels like the time has stopped.{nl}However, many incidents are occurring everyday.{nl}{nl}
We need to bring Stephonas here.{nl}He promised to get us the frost core which will help in studying the Petrifying Frost.{nl}
We should empty the watermill ruins, but I might be suspected if I carry out the work...{nl}Since you are respected by the Royal Army guards, I want you to help me.
They will reduce their boundaries as they are get attacked.{nl}Or bring a huge army in... but, they won't be able to do that with the current state of the kingdom.
Now, please lure the guards at the watermill ruins.{nl}Just tell them the monsters are going crazy at Estuary Bank Three Ways.{nl}
Stephonas will pass by secretly.{nl}Of course, you will receive their respects.
Rofdel will be watching from the watchtower but on a foggy day like this, it's useless.
Stephonas passed through safely.{nl}He was looking for you. Go and help him.{nl}
The guards won't mention our names to Rofdel.{nl}What they have been taking until now was all against the military law.
Have you seen the records that are remaining in this city? Didn't they feel somewhat strange...{nl}The Knights of Kaliss are collecting the records which the Royal Army guards have not yet eliminated.{nl}
I have a request. Please gather the propagandas which the Royal Army guards circulated.{nl}When we compare those with the records that we've gathered, we will find something lacking.
As the defeat of Ruklys became more and more concrete, the Royal Army guards circulated the propagandas more.{nl}There must be some propagandas left in the Petrifying Frost as well.
They made such embarrassing stories sound like a heroic epic to the ignorant people. {nl}600 years have passed, but they are still embarrassing.
You're the one who made me an opportunity.{nl}But, what the hell. I never heard there were so many guards here.
I need your help. I need a more powerful bomb.{nl}The frost core that I promised with the Knights of Kaliss is inside the body of Stone Froster.
Just do as I told you. {nl}If it's not the bomb, we can't pull out the frost core.
The purity level is not satisfactory.{nl}It could take some time.
Since we don't have the fuse, it was made to explode when it gets hit.{nl}I will give you this so I want you to test it on the monsters.
If we can't get this done, we can't even start with the next step.
It won't explode right away and explosion is not steady.{nl}What to do..
It should stick to the monster in order to secure the time to explode with a BAM!{nl}Can you get Sticky Liquid from the monsters in Viskas?
I'll say it again but this is the only way to keep you safe.{nl}Hmm? Of course you should throw it. I am busy.
I think you spilled some on your way. {nl}Too bad for your new shoes.
You will find a stiff Stone Froster in the residential area. {nl}Throw this to Stone Froster to wake it up. Don't forget to move far after throwing it.
When his armor opens up, we should aim for the space.{nl}Don't forget about the frost core.{nl}
So this is the frost core that bothered many people.. {nl}The soldiers who helped you will tell the guy watching from the watchtower about your heroic stories so they won't suspect you. Dont' worry.
I was worried a lot because it seems there's a big fuss over there.{nl}But, I also had some productive results. Everything will be alright soon.{nl}
If you are going to be near here, please come to me. {nl}I could cast a spell on you to protect you from the Petrifying Frost.
Good. Let's go to the old market. {nl}When you touch the petrification detector, Sparnashorn will start to attack you.
Those Dico Thieves are so smart.{nl}They buy cheap antiques from outside and bury them where the Petrifying Frost blow.{nl}
Then they will turn into stones.{nl}The aristocrats in the big cities get deceived by them and they buy them at expensive prices.
There are stones that constantly float down the Vadovo Dock.{nl}It is the record of the rebellion from 600 years ago.{nl}
The records contain the contents that discourage the soldiers so the officers destroyed them from time to time.{nl}But, since we don't have enough workforce, I want you to take care of them.
I don't understand how these heavy stuffs float down here and make us dizzy.{nl}I will probably use them when we repair the watchtower.
Whenever the Petrifying Frost blow, the number of soldiers decreases, but the kingdom doesn't possess additional soldiers to support.{nl}That's why we ask the grave robbers or the refugees to join the military.{nl}
Only thing I can do is to attach these leaflets around here.{nl}I hope you could help me by thinking that you are supporting the kingdom.
I'm sure people taking the leaflets but the number of applicants have decreased recently. {nl}Is it because the grave robbers started checking inside. Isn't it suspicious?
When a person like Premier Eminent appears again, I'm sure that the kingdom will flourish quickly.{nl}I will pray to the goddesses that you could be an important person like him.
The number of monsters in Kovos Hall Site is increasing. {nl}We don't even know what is leading them here.{nl}
We don't expect anything from the Royal Army guards who were supposed to help us in the first place.{nl}If you could help us instead, then I will give you the rewards that I promised to give to the soldiers.
We've investigated about the incident that was occurring in this city from a long time ago.{nl}We are trying to find hidden facts about the rebellion.
I heard you have lots of battle experiences.{nl}I even want to suggest you to join the Knights of Kaliss.
I believe that there is no curse in this world that can't be cured.{nl}With all my faith, I will discover the cure.
You're as great as the rumors say. {nl}The Knights of Kaliss need heroes like you.
This is an interesting place. {nl}This city is filled with things to experiment.
Stone debris and dust blow a lot in this area so many soldiers and knights cough severely. {nl}The headquarters send us refreshing candies mixed with medicinal herbs.{nl}
But our soldiers were swept by the Petrifying Frost while carrying our supplies for this month.{nl}When we found them, the monsters already stole all of them. {nl}Can you get defeat those monsters and get back the refreshing candies?
I would like to give you some if we have extras. {nl}Even the grave robbers are preying on the candies.
I won't blame you if you eat one secretly. {nl}But you don't seem to be that kind of a person.
Soldiers patrolling this area were swept by stone frost while passing by Stalactite square some time ago.{nl}We are only affiliated to the Royal Army, but we're mostly residents of Kalis province.{nl}
I want to help my folks from back home, but there is no way to get them out of the curse. {nl}We can only get their last will and keepsakes for their families. {nl}Won't you show your kindness for them before they lose their consciousness?
I understand their loyalty for the kingdom, but when I see them make people do impossible things that lead to deaths...{nl}I don't know who is the monster anymore.
In order to restore the city, the Knights of Kaliss hired many experts.{nl}But they just recruit people without any support afterwards.{nl}
I desperately need your help so that I can keep doing my research.{nl}If we could create a miraculous medicine that would drag out the{nl}controlled spirit, we may be able to find out the source of this curse.
Besides the knowledge of the spells I possess, I am trying to approach it with various methods.{nl}I will lift this curse for sure.
That's enough ingredients to make the Liberation Elixir. {nl}Now, let's start.
I will give you this Liberation Elixir. Use it on the petrified victims at Vienti Fortress.{nl}Their souls trapped in their body might tell you something about what they last witnessed.
The angry souls might attack you.{nl}Please be careful.
There was nothing to find out about other than the fact that {nl}they were all trembling in panic and fear when they died.{nl}I guess I better look for even older victims.
We can't even find the traces of the bodies of the victims who were sacrificed on the day of Ruklys' rebellion due to Petrifying Frost.{nl}But, that angry souls are deeply permeated into the city.
Please light the fire at the incense burner that I set at Vienti Fortress with the Knightage.{nl}The angry souls will tell you the story of that day.
Please do not stimulate the angry souls.{nl}Since they are unstable, I don't know how they would react.
The pain, anger... The betrayal and fear...{nl}I can still feel the feelings from that day.{nl}
But not towards humans. It's as if it is something deep and dark... {nl}I am going back to the knights to find out more about it.
Even trees or paper turn into stones besides living creatures...{nl}I am very interested in these non-senses. {nl}
If you could help me...{nl}Maybe we could save them even if they are cursed with the petrification. Although they may lose their arms.
Even if it works on just one or two from ten of them, that would be great.{nl}I trust on my knowledge and skills.
You weren't able to save any of them? {nl}I guess this is not a good way. I will take back what is left.
I think we should use different drugs and test as much as we can. {nl}But then we will need a lot of samples.
Can you defeat the monsters in Neiveikiama Castle and get me petrified samples?
This should be enough for about five tests. Good work.
To tell you one more time, the curse of the petrification is a chemical reaction so I don't think you would be able to restore it.{nl}If you could come to me fast, then you will save your life even if you lose one of your legs.
May those victims rest in peace.{nl}However, like the river that attracts those who are thirsty, this place is astounding for me and my thirst for knowledge.{nl}
There's a dumb monster that is ruining the beautiful place on the top of Nebekia Fortress.{nl}I want you to take care of him.
It if has a brain, how can it go around ruining this? {nl}Oh well, maybe that's why it's a monster.
Did you defeat it? Great job!{nl}Now I don't have to fear this place being torn down until another monster shows up.
The Petrifying Frost just swept by so we should get to work quickly.{nl}We can see when and where the Petrifying Frost start by checking whether the soldiers are retreating or not.{nl}
And the quickest way to receive the information is to become a Royal Army guard.
I am not sure since I am a low ranking soldier.{nl}This place originally belongs to Kaliss.{nl}
This place belonged to the kingdom, but due to rebellions, 600 years have passed.{nl}Everyone thinks that the Knights of Kaliss will make a movement again soon.{nl}
But, even in this situation, there aren't any conflicts...{nl}The objective of the people who were dispatched here is on the research like Kostas so how would a low rank soldier like me know anything.
According to what senior officers say, they are not officially belonged to the army, but they are rather somewhat more like mercenaries.{nl}I am not sure, but they asked me about many things on the Petrifying Frost.{nl}
Many people from the Knights of Kaliss actually came here to continue on their research besides Kostas.{nl}What would they want from the city of rebel forces... Isn't it strange?
I don't know well since I am a low ranked soldier, but it seems that they don't like each other.{nl}I understand since they are trying to make a move after managing it for 600 years. Who would like it?{nl}
But, the Knights of Kaliss are saying that it's their fair right and they also said they are going to concentrate on the research so we can't say anything.{nl}What I've heard was to guard them and report their whereabouts... but, then they disappeared again.
I've obtained it by paying a large sum to the Royal Army guards so just take a look at it without touching it.{nl}Due to the petrified places, this place turned into a land which no living creatures could live for hundreds of years.{nl}
But the lives are great. {nl}I predict that the small number of monsters that used to live here became resistant by being exposed to weak Petrifying Frost.{nl}
The crystals that grow inside the special monsters could unleash the power that could face against strong Petrifying Frost.{nl}However, the problem is that they get discovered only one in several hundreds or even thousands... That's a pity.
Thanks.{nl}We would be able to lift the curse of the petrification if we could amplify this ethereal power.{nl}Please first get me the reacting stones from the monsters at Palaikai Intersections. I am counting on you!
Thanks.{nl}The petrification detectors that are left by the Royal Army guards are scattered across Palaikai Intersections.{nl}Among them, please get me the ones that only react to the symbol of schilt.
Ever since I came here, I feel like someone is keep looking at me.{nl}Anyways, see you again after the work is done.
When it gets more apparent in the future, then there would an opportunity to show it to you.{nl}We need to collect more documents.
For now, all I can tell you is that some different objective is involved with the rebellion of Ruklys.
The Royal Army guards forbid anyone in this city from probing into Ruklys.{nl}Anyone who still does that could be treated as a traitor so they educate the soldiers firmly.
But as they hide more and more, more people will be curious about Ruklys.{nl}The gallows could be near, but how could a scholar just do nothing?
You are so brave.{nl}According to the records, there are 10 portals in total. Among them, four of them are near here.{nl}Could you find out if they are still activating?
Please get me the hardened gunpowder from the monsters near the watermill ruins.{nl}Let's make special explosives using that.
I am going to bring in the thieves in through the central city area. {nl}While you are doing so, if you get encountered by a monster, you will soon get caught by the guards.{nl}
That's why I want you to act first at the Estuary Bank Three Way.{nl}Unlike Dico Thieves, they pay back to the people they owed to so they will help your journey for sure.
I don't know if you know the relationship between the soldiers and the Knights of Kaliss, but{nl}anyways, the soldiers are looking for something that they can never have.{nl}
That's why they need the grave robbers. {nl}Of course, it is risky to cooperate with the thieves.{nl}
Even so, it is very valuable.{nl}And for the future, the relationship with the thieves will be useful.{nl}
Please use the Berserk powder on the monsters at the Estuary Bank Three Way.{nl}The monsters won't stand at all and go crazy. It will make a quite mess.
The information should sometimes be leaked, hid or modified in order to have some values.{nl}We could also make connections with different people by doing so.
People say history is the record of the winners. I think so too.{nl}Have you seen the tombstones that are still remaining on the ruins near Fedimian?{nl}
If what the soldiers are spreading is true, then there are many doubts on the records that are remaining here.{nl}And the behaviors of the soldiers that are trying to destroy them are also strange.{nl}{nl}
Throw this against the monsters.{nl}If you are lucky enough, it will explode with a bang!, but if that's not it, you will make them angry.
Please collect the Dark Crystals from the monsters at Vienti Fortress.{nl}I will try to make an elixir that would pull out the controlled spirit.
Thanks. First, would you use this melting solution to the monsters that are struggling due to the Petrifying Frost?{nl}I mean Nebekia Fortress. If it's useful, you would be able to use it on the humans as well.
I personally think the curse of the petrification is a chemical reaction.{nl}Which means you can't restore the things that are once petrified before.{nl}
Even if, Bokor over there tries his best, he won't be able to restore it.{nl}
But, if the petrification is in progress,{nl}Then I think we may able to save the rest even if we lost the parts that have already become petrified.{nl}
Almost all curses will wear off when the one who casted it dies.{nl}That's why I think the curse of the petrification is similar to the one at Pilgrim's Way.{nl}
But the curse has descended for 600 years.{nl}This means the caster of this curse also has lived for 600 years.{nl}
But, if we could find out the true identity of the caster, we may push it with stronger power.
Kostas doesn't seem to be scared.{nl}Yet I am scared even though I've worked here for a long time. I don't have a clue where he went...
I feel sorry for Gofden who should be waiting for me, but I can't go.{nl}I must continue my research.
No one will call you a coward for running from the Petrifying Frost.{nl}But, if you run away from an important task, you will be held accountable.
I am sure there's a way to restore the city that was damaged{nl}due to the rebellion that occurred 600 years ago.{nl}The research on the Petrifying Frost is one of the ways to restore the city.
I am sure there's a way to lift the curse completely.{nl}Although, it seems that Saliamonas has given up.
I am sure there are hidden facts.{nl}Although I don't know what they are.
This city would feel like lost families to the people of Kaliss.{nl}I am sure there's a way to restore the city.{nl}
A few of them are mercenaries, but they are also the people of Kaliss.{nl}The way they look at this city will be the same.
The grave robbers are going all out here.{nl}We have to wait for extra support from headquarters.
I don't give false hopes to other people.{nl}I just want to find more realistic method.
Were you deceived all this time?{nl}If we rub Velas leaves on the boxes, monsters protect them as if they are something precious.{nl}
Good. Please get me Velas leaves at the Trade District.
My heart aches to see my colleagues that are just left out there against the elements after succumbing to the Petrifying Frost...
I don't like the Royal Army guards.{nl}They look at us like traitors for what happened 600 years ago.
Now is the time to retrieve our land.
We can't clearly see it on the days like today when the stone debris are blowing a lot.{nl}But, when it rains, you can clearly see Ruklys Street.
Disciple Laius
We would be able to find the inheritance of the master if we try little more...{nl}
This time, Hones will not stand without handing out the documents.
While I was coming here, I saw the leaflets that encourage people to join the military.{nl}Rip them off all. They are good for sneezing.
Since I don't know what the master has in his mind before he passed away, I am worried.{nl}No one would understand my mind.
I want to talk to Hones again.{nl}It's been such a long time.
Our landlords tried their best to recover this place.{nl}They used every means and the methods they could use.
Everything is my fault that I didn't understand what the master wanted.{nl}I want to apologize to you since I've confused you.
If Adjutant General Hans does something suspicious, please report to us.
If the supplies come at the right time, we won't receive the supplies of the Knights of Kaliss secretly from behind.{nl}Ah, please forget what I've just told you.
Aren't the documents arrived yet?{nl}Is Hones still insisting?
Please refrain from doing something suspicious.{nl}From this watchtower, I can even see how many fingers you have.
You won't be able to avoid the wind of the Petrifying Frost even if the watchtower is tall.{nl}I am too lazy to go up and down.
When I attach the leaflet, someone detached them.{nl}I am not gonna forgive the one who did this.
Those grave robbers can't climb up here easily since there is a watchtower here.{nl}Today... the weather is not that good.
The supplies are coming late today as well.{nl}I heard that the ones who are doing something down there receive the supplies from the Knights of Kaliss secretly.
When I work at this deserted area for a long time, I get to know many secrets that only senior officers don't know.{nl}I want you to just ignore them.
Many petrified records are floating down through the Estuary Bank, but we don't order the soldiers to get rid of them.{nl}I heard the records don't contain good contents.{nl}
I don't understand why they have to do this for what happened 600 years ago.{nl}Well, the guys at Verkti Square are newcomers so they are well disciplined.
The soldiers doing their missions here all worked here for a long time.{nl}They experienced lots of things such as Petrifying Frost or monsters so they are somewhat insensitive now.
Please do not read the old records or take out the artifacts to outside.{nl}Even we can't forgive you if you do so.
Disciple Hones
I came here to keep the last words of our master.{nl}The one who could withstand... they are hard words to understand...
Please let us know when you see any grave robbers.{nl}If you've ignored them when you saw them, it's like you've committed a crime.
How could you have come this far. {nl}Please do not make a mess.
Whenever I do a mission here, I sometimes remember my colleagues who've been sacrificed by the Petrifying Frost.{nl}He could not avoid the Petrifying Frost.
If you find the guy who are detaching the leaflets, please let me know.
Ah, wait. I've heard about you before in the city. {nl}Hmm. I guess I should think little more.
I hope Laius doesn't get hurt from this.{nl}I wonder why the master didn't tell him honestly.
I want to talk to Laius again.{nl}But, I guess I should wait until he comes to me...
I just hope the monsters stay calm.{nl}Maybe I am expecting too much...
The blessings of the goddesses has not reached at this city.{nl}Only the monsters and the criminals are full in this city.
Please report to us when you see monsters.{nl}Especially, when they are grouped together or make a mess.
I've written down what to do at the memo.{nl}First, find the Magic Gem Fusion Device at Underground Grave of Ritinis.
Long time ago, I had serviced as a guard in the army like those guys.{nl}I was a junior officer who wanted become a strategist. At least before Medzio Diena.
If you find any suspicious individual who is not part of the {nl}Royal Army or the Knight of Kaliss, please report to us.{nl}Especially if they look like grave robbers.
Please do not touch anything. Just stay calm.
If you find any old records that cast the kingdom in a negative light, {nl}immediately destroy them or report to us.
The Petrifying Frost may suddenly come, so please be with us if possible.
Aside from the Petrifying Frost, dangerous monsters and menacing grave robbers lurk the corners here.{nl}I am not responsible for incidents you cause out of our watch.
This city is a restricted area.{nl}I will let you pass as I am ordered to, but please refrain from doing anything out of line.
You don't know this place well?{nl}Ruklys' rebellion occurred here 600 years ago.{nl}This place is cursed with the Petrifying Frost, and thus is very dangerous.
I want to be rotated out soon.{nl}I don't want to be in this horrible city anymore.
While we all don't want to be in this place, you just walk right into this city. How strange.
It is illegal to take artifacts, records or relics that belong to this place.{nl}Anyone who does will be punished, so please keep that in mind.{nl}
Once you are hit by the Petrifying Frost, it's all over for you.{nl}We've lost many of our colleagues to the Petrifying Frost.
Many of the kingdom's famous scholars and magicians weren't able to lift the curse of petrification...{nl}I don't understand how a Knight of Kaliss could lift the curse.
The relationship between us Royal Army guards and the Knights of Kaliss is somewhat complicated.{nl}Please refrain from doing something forbidden, even if it is by request from the Knights of Kaliss.
The rules of the Royal Army are supreme here.{nl}Even if you are the famous Revelator.
Even if you've received a request from the Knights of Kaliss, the orders of the Royal Army precedes them.{nl}We are the law here.
I am irritated by the Royal Army guards, but then those Dico Thieves appeared.{nl}How come there are so many people in this small space.
I can't endure anymore. Please save me from these restraints.{nl}I will be released when you defeat the watchers nearby.
My name is Agailla Flurry. {nl}I have realized something from the epitaphs left in the land and I would like to make a confession.
How foolish it is to be overconfident and be swayed by shallow feelings. {nl}You, who lives through such times, must have realized something like I did.{nl}
All other Revelators were wrong.{nl}But if it were you.. I don't know.
I will return to my hometown with my son.{nl}Yes. For sure.
I can't close my eyes before we defeat that monster.
I never expected to see someone in this spooky place. I guess you are very competent.{nl}I am continuing the research of my master here. I guess I can be called a scholar.{nl}
But, in this important moment, Hones is not cooperating with us.{nl}I will be sorry to my master if Hones continues to do like that...{nl}
Really?{nl}That's the most happiest thing that I've heard recently!{nl}
Let's see. They must have hid the orb around here that can be used to store the energy...{nl}Please first get me that. I will get ready myself to use that.
The orb that can be used to tap the energies of the dead.{nl}My master created it. He was a famous sorcerer before.
You've brought it fast. We definitely need this to summon the Wisdom Guiding Stone.{nl}The master left it for me. {nl}
So I have the rights to look at the documents of our master and not Hones right?
Okay. Please absorb the energies of the dead into the orb.{nl}The monsters in this grave possess the energies of the dead ones so it will be easy.
You need to absorb the energies from more monsters.{nl}The Wisdom Guiding Stone can't be summoned easily.
The orb seems full of energy.{nl}This will be enough.
Now, we are able to summon the Wisdom Guiding Stone.{nl}We will inject the energy into the Soul Crystal that is located in Maras Stone Chamber...
But, whenever we tried to do that, the monsters also came so we failed each time.{nl}If only Hones helped me...
When you obtain the Wisdom Guiding Stone, please show it to Hones at Raiduna Hall.{nl}If he finds out that I am the only one who could continue the research of the master, he would hand over the documents.
Hones did not cooperate with us until now, but he would have to hand them over this time.{nl}As the master only left the orb to me, the Wisdom Guiding Stone can only be obtained by me.
Hmm? Isn't that the Wisdom Guiding Stone?{nl}Who are you and why are you showing it to me?
Damn, Laius is misunderstanding something.{nl}No. Maybe the master and the goddess guided us this far.{nl}
Anyways, I have the Wisdom Guiding Stone as well.
Laius... has a problem.{nl}I can't say it. Go to the hideout of the master. Then you would believe it.
Maybe, it turned out better than we thought.{nl}I didn't expect Laius would help us.
The master researched about the goddesses throughout his entire life.{nl}And then he discovered something important, but he said if it goes into the hands of the demons, it will be dangerous.{nl}
As you saw, Laius is trying to find the remains of the research of the master due to his greed.{nl}But, they should never be exposed to the world.
Ahah. Revelator. Maybe...{nl}The master said someone who is reliable should dispose of his research before he died.{nl}
And the remains of the research are at the place where normal people like me or Laius can not reach.{nl}If you are really the Revelator, I want you to dispose of them.
In order to find the remains of the research, we need the Eyes of Truth.{nl}But, not too long ago, they were destroyed due to monsters.
With the Wisdom Guiding Stone, you will be able to find the monsters that carry fragments of the Eyes of Truth.
Even if you are not the Revelator, I am counting on you.{nl}I know the Wisdom Guiding Stone can't be obtained that easily.
Good. With this, we can restore the Eyes of Truth completely.
Okay. With these Eyes of Truth, we will find the Soul Crystal.{nl}It is little complicated, but please think that is it is that important.{nl}
Shadowgaler in the Room of Lamentation has the Soul Crystal, but you can't attack it with an usual method.{nl}It has an astral body so it is invisible.{nl}However, with the Eyes of Truth, you would be able to see it.
I didn't know why the master left such words since he doesn't know which person I would ask to get rid of the remains of the research.{nl}But, now I understand why he left such words since I've met you.
The remains of the research can be found using the documents which Laius desperately wanted to have.{nl}
Please take the Wisdom Guiding Stone and the Soul Crystal with you and look for the Magic Gem Fusion Device in the Underground Grave of Ritinis.{nl}I will write down the method for you.
You've come late. {nl}Did you get the documents of the master from Hones?
I had a misunderstanding...{nl}But I wanted be acknowledged by the master like Hones.{nl}
The master always complimented me, but I felt uncomfortable whenever I thought about Hones.{nl}Although, he passed away already... It is good to find out what the master had in his mind.{nl}
I feel comfortable now. {nl}I want to talk to Hones.
Very good. You've found the remains of the master's research.{nl}I will let you dispose of them. It is more important for me to continue the will of the master.{nl}
I feel disappointed a bit, but I also feel comfortable in a way.{nl}Well... Laius... I hope he would be alright.
Magic Gem Fusion Device
Please gather all Spatial Magic Gems.{nl}It is hard to understand the hidden rules of space, but my knowledge would help you.
My master, who was a Sorcerer, researched on the goddesses.{nl}It was about some special kind of space. He said a vast amount of knowledge can be obtained from that space.
Hones' Regular Memo
The Spatial Magic Gem of Contract is in the reception room, but it was destroyed recently.{nl}The monsters must have fragments of the gem.
When you collect all fragments of the Magic Gem, please go to the Forgotten Priest's Grave. {nl}You can restore the Magic Gem at the Magic Field of Preservation.
Hones' Regular Memo
You will find the Spatial Magic Gem of Promise at Siaura Mine.{nl}Please use the Soul Crystal to the monsters and collect the Condensed Spite.{nl}
With that, destroy the Barrier Stone at Siaura Mine.{nl}The Black Chaser will pursue you from behind, but you would be able to find the Spatial Magic Gem of Promise when you reach the end of the mine.
Templeshooter at the Shrine of Remembrance holds the Spatial Magic Gem of Offer.{nl}The Wisdom Guiding Stone will help you to find the hidden Templeshooter.
Please... save us.{nl}I will soon disappear, but please save the others.{nl}Please save us... them... from the vicious demons.
Kupole Vita
Given that you saw it too,{nl} I'm certain there is something here.{nl}
Ah, I am Kupole Vita.{nl}I guide the spirits on behalf of the missing goddesses.
I came here to look for spirits who have vanished.{nl} I can sense that there are spirits here who have strayed out of the normal way.{nl}
But, I can hardly find any evidence.{nl}The spirits hardly talk to me.
What? The spirits talked to you first?{nl}You must have something which enables you to save them.{nl}
I have a request for you.{nl}I want you to hear what they are trying to say.
Since there aren't enough evidence, I think we should look for more spirits.{nl}We should also find out why they disappeared without leaving any words.
The reason why the spirits aren't able to talk is due to a contract.{nl}The demons is probably used the Pot of Silence as a Contract of Enunciation.{nl}
However, the ominous energy of the contract is too strong for me to get close.{nl}I will give you some purification powders for you to ward off the energy and destroy the pot.{nl}
Be careful though. {nl}It will be very dangerous if it is related to the demons.
Perhaps the vanished spirits breached the contract by talking. {nl}I think they wanted to get out by doing so.
It seems that you've destroyed the Pot of Silence safely.{nl}Though, is there any other problem?
It seems that the demons have noticed our movement.{nl} We should resolve this fast before the demons do anything.{nl}
Since the Contract of Enunciation was destroyed, we should be able to listen to the spirits in more details.{nl}It will be good to find the spirits that know the details of the circumstance.
Rimos' Spirit
It has been a long time. You... I am finally being released.{nl}I've been deceived by the demons. My words, body and even the spirit have been binded to the contract for hundreds of years.{nl}
Please gather the skeletons binded to the Contract of Flesh at Supube Stone Chamber.{nl} Help them rest in peace...{nl}
Nutrients... Medzio Diena even makes the people in the past to suffer.
My body. Unfortunately, it is not mine anymore.{nl}I regret my fault in the past that I've committed due to my greed.
The Contract of Flesh is tied in Sataruti Hall.{nl}Please burn the contract and the skeletons with holy power.
We've suffered a lot from regrets and failures for hundreds of years.{nl}The goddesses yet... Would we be saved.
I can feel it. I feel myself being freed from the binding contract.{nl}But, there is one more thing to do.
The Contract of Spirit is engraved on Master Genie in Garbingal Burial Chamber.{nl}I will be completely free when Master Genie gets defeated.
Please be safe.{nl}We are already dead, but you are not.
I can finally be free...{nl}This was the moment I've been waiting for hundreds of years... It feels like a dream.
We the Kupoles guide all the spirits to Goddess Ausrine.{nl}They rest in peace beside the goddesses eternally.{nl}
But they will all disappear if they are extinguished.{nl}But, if the demons are involved... we could maybe use them for nutrients.{nl}
Something is engraved on this tablet.{nl}To see what's written, you should obtain the materials to make rubbings with.
Adrijus
Oh, you must have seen my notice board.{nl}Well, I don't care if that's not why you came here.{nl}If you could get me the rubbings found in this region, I will properly reward you.{nl}
Let's see...{nl} 
May the threads of destiny be cut loose and flutter freely
?{nl}Could this be Goddess Laima...
May the threads of destiny be cut loose and flutter freely.
Oh, is that a rubbing? Thank you so much. {nl}Let's see...{nl} 
The Kingdom's walls will last longer than the Kingdom itself
This is actually correct!{nl}The capital is in ruins now, yet the walls still remain standing.
Welcome!{nl}Pick out anything you want.
Look at the inscription beside me. This tombstone has eroded against the elements since time immemorial. {nl}We need to restore it.{nl}
Be careful with this. It is a poison that turns body fluids into acid.{nl}Throw this on the monsters nearby and bring me the acid you get.
Long ago, this place was the training field for those who wanted to become Oracles.{nl}People trained here and created inscriptions with these forecasts.{nl}
I am sure that must be helpful forecasts in this area.{nl}Even though all the important forecasts are gone.
Oh, yes. There is some diluent that I requested from the Item Merchant in Fedimian.{nl}Could you pick that up for me as well?
With the acidic fluid, I can etch deeper into the tombstone.{nl}Don't forget to pay a visit to Fedimian as well.
Ah, this is it. Thank you for your efforts.{nl}Now, I will combine it with the diluting solution and pour it...
Aha... what...? 
To eat a Kepa, one simply boils it in salty water.
...{nl}This isn't a useful forecast!{nl}
Kepas are edible?{nl}Is this a useful forecast? I am confused.
There is hardly any sand stuck on the tablet at Gruitis Hall.{nl}I've brought a brush, but it won't be effective enough.{nl}
I need a tougher brush. I'm sorry, but could you get me some stiff fur by any chance?{nl}Wait for when the Wendigo Archers faint after hitting them with this dart.
Until then, I will be looking around the other tablets.{nl}Alright then, I am counting on you.
Nice, we're both back just in time.{nl}Give those to me. I can easily make a brush out of it.
I'm not sure if you've noticed, but these tablets record forecasts of the future.{nl}This place used to be a training ground for Oracles a long time ago.{nl}
I am doing research on the forecasts that are still remaining here.{nl}I need an assistant. What do you think?
Good. You will also get valuable information and experience out of this.{nl}Okay, shall we get started?
This was the training field of the Oracles in the past.{nl}I am looking for abandoned forecasts here.
When you pull the levers in order, the tombstones may react.
You seem to have some other request for me.{nl}How can I help you?
Eitbaras... he...{nl}
Thank you for telling me this precious story.{nl}But, we cannot tell you what we know about the story as of yet.{nl}
But, I will give you a copy of the writings from the tombstone in return.{nl}I believe you may meet him one day...
Eitbaras' Records
I am leaving this record when I am still Eitbaras.{nl}
{nl}I am in awe of them.{nl}A humble fairy like me can't be compared with them...{nl}{nl}
I still remember a time when they were peaceful.{nl}But, those days are long gone.{nl}
Those very beings now hold strong ambitions and war with no end in sight...{nl}Even a fairy like me could not pretend to not see this.{nl}{nl}
As the discord of these great beings began to envelop the world, I too became curious to why they conflicted with each other.{nl}Perhaps, now is the time the humans can begin living independent lives.
Ausrine refrained from answering my questions about the conflict.{nl}She instead asked me to pray for good luck for the humans taking shelter in their homes.{nl}{nl}
Giltine also didn't give an answer.{nl}As usual, she did not support the role Ausrine suggested to me.{nl}{nl}
But there is fortune and misfortune in luck, and my mission is to manage both sides.{nl}I hold those words true to my heart and use them as a guiding principle in my work.{nl}{nl}
Since then, I've spent countless hours performing my new role.{nl}However, my duties didn't give an answer to my questions.
That's why I went to see Giltine.{nl}After listening to my repetitive questions, she finally opened her mouth after a long silence.{nl}{nl}
I am not going to give you the answer.{nl}But, I can give you the power.{nl}
The power that may lead you to the answer that you are seeking.{nl}Even if you never get the answer, you will be satisfied with your new changes.
I immediately left without saying anything.{nl}But soon I...realizing I was so close to finally getting something...{nl}found myself sobbing...and realized what I truly wanted{nl}{nl}
When the sun goes down tomorrow, I will return to Giltine. And tell her my decision.
Archeologist Justas
I am so lucky. The goddesses helped me this time as well.
Ah, I am Justas. I am excavating the records of Demetrius who is the historian from the ancient period.{nl}What has brought you here?
Is that so... Revelator... Then you would like my research.{nl}Actually, I needed someone who would be my guard and assistant. Are you interested?
This place are the ruins before the construction of the kingdom.{nl}But, I am not that interested in here.{nl}
What I really want are the records of Demetrius.{nl}It is unique that it is recorded on a Metal Plate...It seems to contain an amazing story.{nl}
Maybe we would be able to find out where we came from.{nl}Then we may be able to find out what would happen to us as well.
Good. Good. I will give you the task of obtaining the bone pieces of Hallowventer curse speller.{nl}They are the best materials to use when you make an antirust agent.
It is so fortunate to have a good assistant.{nl}The goddesses helped me on this as well.
There's a saying that geniuses are freaks. How should the people of the later generations do if the Metal Plate gets rusted.{nl}Anyways, the work is being done quickly because of you so I feel happy.
I want to request to you to bring the Metal Plate on Ramive Hills.{nl}There are many plates that I could not bring due to the monsters. You can do it right?
This place is too isolated so the monsters rush in.{nl}Be careful all the time.
Good!{nl}But, the status is too bad so it would take a long time...
What a view, don't you think?{nl}Though there are grander things hidden here, such as the records of historian Demetrius.{nl}
I am looking for the records of Demetrius that haven't been discovered yet.{nl}The monsters are dangerous, but I have a good feeling.
Alruida is near Apsba Hall.{nl}We've been working together for a long time so even if we are far apart, we know each other well.
Isn't it great to hear that humans, goddesses and demons may lived together for a long time?{nl}But, then how come there are no records remaining?
That is so shocking.{nl}A great scholar like Demetrius could had not recorded lies.
Since we haven't found everything, we can't say this for sure, but...{nl}I think it's about where humans came from.
Archeologist Alruida
Are you also interested in historian Demetrius?{nl}Or are you just a traveler?
There was a progress in the research because of you.{nl}Now we should find out if his records are fictitious or real.
If his records are real, it will make many people shock.{nl}But, personally, I don't want to believe it.
I am chasing after the Metal Plate that is engraved with the records of Demetrius.{nl}I am keep getting interrupted by the monsters, but we have some results though.
Ahah...
I am looking for the disappeared spirits.{nl}The spirits that are out of their normal journey.{nl}
After Medzio Diena, scary things are happening.{nl}The reason why the spirits lose their ways are related to it.
The spirits don't say anything to me.{nl}Have you heard any stories of them?
The only thing I could do was to depress for hundreds of years.{nl}I want to just disappear if I can.
What can I do after losing the master and the body.{nl}Besides just watching the demons...
I can't neither go beside the goddesses nor be eliminated.{nl}For what... I am doing... such...
Collapsing Stone Tower
The Stone Tower is collapsing by someone. Do you want to go to the Stone Tower?
I am leaving this record when I am still Eitbaras.{nl}-{nl}I am in awe of them.{nl}A humble fairy like me can't be compared with them...{nl}{nl}
I still remember a time when they were peaceful.{nl}But, those days are long gone.{nl}Those very beings now hold strong ambitions and war with no end in sight...{nl}Even a fairy like me could not pretend to not see this.{nl}{nl}
As the discord of these great beings began to envelop the world, {nl}I too became curious to why they conflicted with each other.{nl}Perhaps, now is the time the humans can begin living independent lives.{nl}{nl}
Since then, I've spent countless hours performing my new role.{nl}However, my duties didn't give an answer to my questions.{nl}{nl}
I am not going to give you the answer.{nl}But, I can give you the power.{nl}The power that may lead you to the answer that you are seeking.{nl}Even if you never get the answer, you will be satisfied with your new changes.
I immediately left without saying anything.{nl}But soon I... realizing I was so close to finally getting something...{nl}found myself sobbing... and realized what I truly wanted.
When the sun goes down tomorrow, I will return to Giltine. And tell her my decision.{nl}
A method to restore a destroyed tombstone at the Namu Temple Ruins?{nl}Since you come to my shop often, I can help you with that.
The sticky resin from Green Roftlems is widely used as stone adhesives.{nl}However, you can't find them through normal means in the Namu Temple Ruins.
So, here's a bait box.{nl}They go crazy on the smell of the food inside. They will be lured to that smell.
When you find the sticky resin, please mix it with this coagulant before using it.{nl}Stones will be easily attached.
It will be easier to make perfume from a Kepa than to find it without using a bait box.{nl}Even going to Laukyme Swamp would be less of a hassle.
Ah. It definitely reacted this time.{nl}I would have spent a long time without your help. Thank you so much.
Thanks for helping us.{nl}The goddess helps the ones who try their best, and I think it was you, the Revelator.
Many demons are gathering at Rituala to participate in a magic ritual that frees Blut.{nl}Please, first defeat them.
Valtruss is defeated but his servants are still left in Oruarma Cathedral. {nl}I want you to make those demons pay for their sins.
Even if you are the Revelator, you better not fool around. {nl}The corruption here is not something for you to mind.
I wish you good luck in the name of the goddess.
I am solely to blame for all of this.{nl}With the Evening Star Key, three seals should be unleashed,{nl} so I could recover my power to find Dionys.
The dimensional crack.. We cannot close it without Dionys.{nl}Please find Dionys until I recover my power..
My mission is to retrieve the relics, but I can't stand and watch this anymore.{nl}Can you defeat the monsters that are roaming around the Great Cathedral?
If this Great Cathedral gets purified, all credit would go to you.{nl}But, we still have a long way to go.
I believe that my research will be helpful in tough times like nowadays.{nl}Of course, we should first find helpful forecasts.
I am sure it contains a breakthrough idea.{nl}What did the Oracle see...
Dead of the dead... what could that mean.{nl}Do you have any idea?
Amanda
Let's see
Day by day
The monsters ruined the apiary and the brewery.{nl}So Joseph went to Klaipeda to look for Revelators who could help us. {nl}
I thought they would've solved the problem, but guess what happened.{nl}They started disappearing one by one. They backed out. Those cowards.
If you think you are ready, I will show you the true origin of the curse.{nl}If you can't eliminate it at once, it will cause bigger trouble.
But, there is still a way.{nl}If you could help me.
If it's okay with you, can you check the reagent's effects?{nl}Ah, I didn't mean trying it on yourself. I meant trying it on the demons.
It's done. {nl}I hope it works.. Can you give this meat to the pilgrim down below?
You must feed him until he's satisfied.{nl}Here's all the meat that you got. 15 pieces, right?
Are peaceful days going to return, just like the good old times?
I want to bury Dallas at Taika Cliff, where he can see his hometown.{nl}But there are so many monsters there. Please get rid of them.
Aren't you the Revelator?{nl}
Ah, it's great that you're here.{nl}You must have traveled to various places in the kingdom.{nl}I am sorry, but do you know anything about this mysterious girl?{nl}
The girl left this tree before Medzio Diena.{nl}My master asked me to find out more about the tree, but I know nothing about it... I want to get help from you.
This farm's owner is Gina Greene.{nl}She kindly lent this farm to people like us who lost land since Medzio Diena.
Hey you. Revelator. Don't just look at me. Help me.{nl}Please drive out the Lizardmen on my fields.
You must know that there's a food shortage in the kingdom right now.{nl}If you are okay with it, can you help me with my investigation?
I really appreciate it.{nl}First, collect Rambear Fur from the Rambear Archers nearby. I need to check something.
If that's the case, please eliminate all the Stumpy Trees.{nl}Oh, and don't forget to bring evidence as well. I need something to report with.
Even if you are the Revelator, this is a private land. {nl}Get out if you don't have any business here!{nl}
We have a big problem!{nl}The spoiled grape vines dried to their deaths, but now monsters are attracted to them.{nl}What can I do?
Investigate the bushes near the grape vines, hidden monsters may suddenly appear.{nl}I am counting on you.
Sometimes, more monsters will appear when you shake the bushes.
I paid a lot for this at the black market in Fedimian.{nl}Perhaps, this will be much more helpful than you or that shameless druid.{nl}
This is sturdy. You've been suffered by the trap of Ebonypawn.{nl}But, what have brought you here?{nl}
You are the Revelator? It's so nice to meet you.{nl}Thanks for saving me... I have another request for you.
We are doing an important mission at the moment.
This is a little complicated.{nl}We are chasing after Ebonypawn who is the suspect of the murder case at the Astral Tower.{nl}But, he is being protected by these religious rules at the monastery nearby.{nl}
So, please help us to get Ebonypawn.{nl}We should somehow first persuade the monks.. Though, that's going to be tricky.
I am so sorry. {nl}Please first persuade Potos at Diliti Court.
The monks shake their heads in denial when we mention Ebonypawn...
Do you know of the Astral Tower?{nl}Starting with Lydia Schaffen, the greatest archers are all originated from that place.{nl}
The head of the Astral Tower was killed by Ebonypawn.{nl}I've chased him up till here, but I'm having trouble of doing anything further,{nl}because of the religious rules of the sanctuary{nl}
The monastery protect the ones who are falsely charged.{nl}I thought that the law was ineffective after Medzio Diena.. I want to resolve this without creating a conflict.
Hello. Traveler.{nl}What has brought you here?
If you are here to discuss about the Hunters, I am sorry, but I'll pass.{nl}
The monastery is full of monsters and we should first{nl}cure the monks who have been hit by the paralysis poison.{nl}Now is not the time to be involved in such a complicated matter.
The Hunters... They must know how to detoxify.{nl}These are the needles that we've gotten from our brothers. I am sorry.
If our brothers help, I am willing to help you as well.{nl}I have a lot on my mind.
This... All right. It's pretty obvious who did this.{nl}Well, first give them this antidote. Fortunately, the poison is not that severe.
I am embarrassed to see the faces of the Hunters... I am sorry.{nl}We also have to consider our position of the monastery.
But, if the poison is really from Ebonypawn, then the story will be different.{nl}I am sorry, but I want to see the trap myself.
Recently, monsters have rushed into the monastery.{nl}It was very quick and the monsters went crazy in the monastery as if they were possessed by something.{nl}
We had no other choice but to run away.{nl}The problem was abbot. He was praying in the Prayer Room.{nl}
Fortunately, the Prayer Room is the safest place in the monastery.{nl}We know that even monsters can't do anything there, but we couldn't just do nothing.
So, there is not enough evidence, huh?{nl}
Reina, a subordinate of mine, is looking for the traces of Ebonypawn down there.{nl}Recently, she found something, but it seems she's having difficulty.
It looks like your task is going smoothly.{nl}You know, I've received rewards that are bigger than my life in value.
Hey, don't walk around recklessly, it's dangerous here.{nl}I recommend you to move out from this forest while you can.
Hello. Traveler.{nl}What has brought you here?
What? The captain sent you to me? Excuse me, I'm sorry.{nl}There is a working trap, but it's not easy to get it. {nl}
I kind of have a problem here, I cannot move.{nl}I've been caught by the trap. I'm such an idiot... I've quickly detoxified myself, but it still hurts.
I will lend you my Jareth.{nl}He makes many mistakes because of his old age, but please understand that.
I guess I am not competent enough yet.{nl}I wanted to become like the Hunter Captain... I guess I still have a long way to go.
Let's take a look at this... This has been made with some skill that I have seen often. {nl}The captain is looking for a working trap, right? Please bring him this.
As your competence increases, people won't know who made these traps.{nl}On the contrary, people may find out who made these traps so easily.{nl}
Besides, the difficulty lowers by a lot if there's only one suspect like in this case.{nl}We just have to find his characteristics.
As I expected, that is indeed from Ebonypawn. {nl}I can hardly find any trace of him.{nl}
But, the traps are easily made with the materials nearby. {nl}We just have to hope that the monk notices it. First, take it and show it to him.
After you have persuaded the monk, please meet Natasha at Viltis Forest.{nl}I've gotten word that she's at a loss.
Look at this. This is the silk that was used in this trap... I believe I've seen it before.{nl}If someone got his hands on the supplies of the monastery, we can think of only one person.{nl}
Good.{nl}After retrieving the monastery, I will tell the abbot about this.
The captain sent you here?{nl}It's about time that reliable support came to me.
You will have to persuade the other brothers besides me.{nl}There is a place nearby called Viltis Forest. Senior Monk Marko can be found there.
Something big happened at the monastery.{nl}Would you be able to help us?
I think I've lost my precious scripture while I was running away.{nl}But, I also have to take care of our brothers.. Can you look for them? I don't care if you only find the pages.
If you can't find them, then we would have to accept it.{nl}People's lives are more important than the pages of the scripture.
So they are ripped off..{nl}I guess we have no other choice. Please, let's first concentrate on curing my brothers.
It's the worst case scenario.{nl}The forest is covered with thorns and there are traps everywhere.{nl}
And my brothers are suffering because of the poison.{nl}If the threat of the monsters lowers down, I would be relaxed enough to finish the cure.
Who made all these traps?{nl}I don't feel very well seeing my brothers suffer.
Thank you so much.{nl}I will now pray for our brothers for a full recovery.
Since I quickly ran away from the monastery, I wasn't able to bring many things with me.{nl}I should somehow feed some nutritious food to our brothers who are suffering from the poison..
Thank you so much.{nl}There is a mushroom called Tempas. It grows really fast.{nl}Please get me some of those from Juklas Sunny Place.
You will find it when you walk diligently.{nl}They are usually hidden in the ground.
Thanks.{nl}I will pray to the goddesses that they will be okay after eating this.
Since I am not feeling well right now, I do want to prepare in advance.{nl}If you are going to hunt for monsters nearby, could you please listen to my request?
Please collect the stone legs of the Rocktors.{nl}I can use those for my arrowheads.
The stone legs of Roctors near this are usable.{nl}Other things are somewhat soft.
This many.. Thank you so much.{nl}It will be good if we return to the place where the captain is, but we should first finish our mission.
I think the monsters found out that I have suffered from the poison.{nl}They are slowly narrowing the gap. This could be dangerous.
Let's use Jareth.{nl}Even if you stand in front, they may rush in when you leave.{nl}
Please hunt for the monsters with Jareth.{nl}After they engage in combat, the monsters will be scared if Jareth unleashes its smell.
Jareth is old, but very brave.{nl}Sometimes he has the tendency to attack first because of his bravery...
Did Jareth do well?{nl}Now we can worry less about the monsters.
We should retrieve the monastery.{nl}If we don't move fast, the abbot will be in danger.
The abbot here is called Marko and he leads the monastery here.{nl}But, he is too stubborn. He is too difficult.{nl}
I will support here with all I could so I hope you pass my position.
I should've persuaded him slowly, but I think we were in a rush.{nl}But, it was that important...
You are a different person. Even so, no is no.{nl}They are very rude. They know the circumstances well, and Ebonypawn...{nl}
And the abbot is locked in the monastery.{nl}Unless we retrieve the monastery, do not mention about the deportation.
If retrieving monastery is more important, that's good.{nl}If they approve, we will support with everything we can.{nl}
You should first help those monks.{nl}They should have more than one person in trouble. You should do favors for them first.
Hunters will step up first. They should have done that in the first place.{nl}Then, I have something to request to you.{nl}
We were preparing to retrieve the monastery ourselves.{nl}Please let our brothers down there know that Hunters are helping.{nl}
I shall wait for Boros. I am counting on you.
Do not think bad about us.{nl}We should first retrieve the monastery, but they are only talking about Ebonypawn so we don't feel comfortable.
We have a problem. {nl}One of the monks have been suffering to the poison of Ebonypawn.{nl}
He is breathing, but he is becoming stiff.{nl}What should we do about this...
This place is dangerous.{nl}Be cautious at all times.
We've passed the dangerous situation with an emergency procedure, but...{nl}If we don't detoxify it completely, there will be more crises.{nl}
This is the first time I'm seeing this kind of combination of poison.{nl}I'm going to check on him, while I do that, please get me the other poison.
If I'm right, then the poison can be acquired from the thorns of a Chafperor.
The poison must have been made using material that can be found around this area. {nl}Please hurry, before it's too late.
It is so fortunate that we discovered it before it was too late.
You are not too late.{nl}I hope one of these three poisons will work.
We were planning to search for a Wugushi in the city, but fortunately it seems that we don't need to do that.{nl}I think I will be able to make an antidote if we have the leaves from Woodluwa.
I was worried that we may have to move to another city.{nl}If we have to look for a Wugushi there, then we can't guarantee our lives.
I'll absorb the poison with this.{nl}I am going to keep looking over him so please care of Marko, he seems uneasy.
You won't understand how embarassed and painful I am.{nl}My brother almost died due to the poison and I received help from the Hunters that I kicked out...{nl}
Good. You would have to persuade Goss at Laukyme Swamp.{nl}Please tell Marko that I've decided to go with Hunters.
Fortunately, it turned out alright.{nl}Please meet Captain Mintz on your way to Laukyme Swamp and tell him that everything went alright.
Senior monk Goss is leading the brothers at Laukyme Swamp.{nl}If Ebonypawn did all of these, the goddesses would also understand my rage.
It's so nice seeing you.{nl}So how did the task at Viltis Forest go?
Go first.{nl}I will follow you to Laukyme Swamp if he gets there alright.
So that's it. We now have to persuade one of the monks and retrieve the monastery...{nl}After that, we would be able to contact with the abbot who would decide what to do with Ebonypawn.
I will gather the Hunters.{nl}Please continue to help Natasha at Laukyme Swamp.
When you go up the Ershike Path, you will reach Laukyme Swamp.{nl}If you fail to persuade them, then we would have to retrieve the monastery ourselves.
You've come a long way.{nl}So I heard a monk named Goss is taking the place of the abbot.
Strange... a traveler in this place.
It's so shameful as a hunter...{nl}After finding the traces of Ebonypawn, I was really delighted, but I found out that was a trap...{nl}
I am sorry, but can you look for the grass that he is looking for?{nl}I can only move one of my arms and my neck.
It's so fortunate that you came before the monsters.{nl}I am counting on you.
Good. Good. {nl}We should first survive before feeling embarassed. Thanks!
We have lots of things to prepare.
You are not... one of those Hunters.{nl}Since I can't trust them, I have a request for you.{nl}
I want to make an ointment for the wounded brothers.{nl}Can you make beehives with the blessing from the goddesses?
It took so little time for monsters to sweep across the monastery.{nl}I think I was lucky enough to be alive with the blessing from the goddesses.
You've tried hard, but... we were making beeswax, but strangely, it doesn't become clear at all.{nl}What should we do about this...
That's it. I am sorry, but can you help me with one more thing?{nl}If I only have the resin that is collected in the head of Woodluwa I think I will be able to resolve it.
I didn't expect I would meet someone other than those Hunters.{nl}I am sure the goddesses haven't abandoned me yet.
I wasn't able to do anything myself, but it is so fortunate that the goddesses have sent you.{nl}I will make some medicine. Thank you so much!
Stranger...{nl}If you don't have any task here, please go back.
The monastery is locked with the barriers of the monks so it won't be possible without the persuasion from Goss.{nl}But, I... it's too difficult.
Hunters... they just won't give up.{nl}I've heard Marko and Potos are with the Hunters.{nl}
But, you should be cautious.{nl}We just can't listen to one side.
After persuading him, we can immediately start to retrieve the monastery.{nl}We can expect to expel Ebonypawn then.
Without Goss, we won't be able to recover the monastery.{nl}I hope you succeed in persuading him.
But, I think we can resume the talk after retrieving the monastery.{nl}Please show me the competence which I could rely on so I can cooperate with you.
Good.{nl}The Liverworts and Stonacons around here would be enough. Please also bring the proofs.
You can give up if you feel that's too much for you.{nl}We were gonna finish it ourselves.
You definitely possess the competence. We also have the same objective.{nl}There is no reason to insist anymore.
The senior monk here is very picky.
I will gather the monks in front of the entrance of the monastery, so tell the Hunters to gather as well.{nl}After they are here, we will unleash the seals to block any monsters from following us.{nl}
But, although we retrieved the monastery, don't expect us to expel Ebonypawn.{nl}The abbot will decide everything after he comes out from the Prayer Room.
Please understand that we could only do this.{nl}We've only listened to your story.
What Goss said also makes sense.{nl}As they gather in front of the monastery, we should have some {nl}decisive evidence that would withdraw Ebonypawn's declaration.
I think we would have enough time.{nl}I am sorry, but please go back to Goss and ask him {nl}what happened when Ebonypawn was coming.
You can't prove that he was a cruel assassin.{nl}We can't release the ones that are being protected in the sanctuary by just guessing.{nl}
What they said about the traps and the monsters {nl}that conquered the monastery are also the same.{nl}It's only a one-sided story that this was done by Ebonypawn.{nl}
We are the people who pray for the generosity of the goddesses.{nl}So to withdraw the protection of Ebonypawn, you should show them some decisive evidence.
Hmm. I remember that clearly.{nl}One day, someone named Ebonypawn knocked on the door of the monastery. {nl}With his wounded body...{nl}
After bringing him inside, I began to cure him.{nl}He also requested to protect the sanctuary at our monastery.
That's right. Before he came on that day, one man {nl}who seemed to be affected by the poison also came.{nl}He was very ill, and eventually passed away before I could even ask him a question.{nl}
His grave is in Priekis Rest Area. With his keepsakes.{nl}Ah, Ebonypawn also asked me whether there was someone who came before him.
The man affected by the poison... I am sure he ran away from Ebonypawn.{nl}But why did he run away from Ebonypawn...
There weren't any other things besides that.{nl}Did this help you?
It's not good for the deceased, but I think I should look for his keepsakes from his grave.{nl}I need to find out why Ebonypawn was chasing after him. Please, you have to help me.
Did you find anything?
This is the directory of the Schaffenstar.{nl}There's a letter in the middle of it... This is the seal of the Schaffenstar. Let's rip it off.
This is the request letter for murder and the confirmation of the receipt. {nl}The receiver is Ebonypawn...{nl}I think Ebonypawn thought this letter would be at the monastery.{nl}
I am sure that Ebonypawn caused the mess of the monsters to look for this. {nl}It was easy for him to do this. This is decisive evidence. Let's show it to Goss.
A murder request... This is the evidence we need.{nl}The abbot would think differently of him when he sees this.{nl}
All the other monks are ready and went in front of the monastery.{nl}Let's go. I will see you in front of the monastery.
Everything is clear now.{nl}I will go to the entrance of the monastery first. Let's join there together.
You've came?{nl}We are ready to enter the monastery.
Everyone seems to be gathering in front of the monastery.{nl}Let's hurry.
I thought it was a manner not to touch it since it was his last keepsake.{nl}How would anyone have thought it would turn out like this.
Everyone knows that the Hunter Master and the Ranger Master are chasing after Ebonypawn.{nl}But, the reason why no one could step forward is because they didn't have any decisive evidence.{nl}
Now, this is different. This letter is evidence.{nl}Since we have the seal of the Schaffenstar, we don't have to worry about it.
This place is dangerous... I miss the monastery.
I want to be safe until I go back to the monastery.{nl}But the monsters near here are very threatening.
There will be lots of monsters if we move out a bit from the hills.{nl}I'll be counting on you.
Now, I can relax until I go back to the monastery.{nl}Thank you so much. I hope the goddesses bless you...{nl}
We don't have enough water to drink here. It is strange since this place is full of water.{nl}After this place turned into a thorny forest, we can't drink it without purifying it.{nl}
If we have Asilado water plant, we can purify it with that.{nl}But, I am too scared of the monsters... Can you obtain some of them?
We would last for a while even if there's no food, but not without drinkable water.{nl}I hope you would help us.
Wow. You've collected a lot.{nl}Thank you so much. We will use these water plants well.
We need help due to the monsters!
I didn't expect someone to come to this dangerous place...{nl}I am observing the movements of the monsters.{nl}
Everyone will gather here after we are done. {nl}Just in case they may lose their strength due to the monsters,{nl}before we begin retrieving the monastery.
There are more dangerous monsters inside the monastery.{nl}We don't have a chance if we lose all our energies here.
Thank you.{nl}But, I am worried since there are still many monsters left.
Are you trying to help me more?{nl}If that's so, it will be really appreciated...
We've cleaned up many monsters. {nl}One more thing... I want you to do the last task.
Thanks for your efforts.{nl}When the monks ask me, I will tell them to pray to the goddesses to protect you.
When you go into the monastery, let's first secure the entrance of Prayer Room.{nl}I will leave when you are ready.
We've recovered the hall. Let's continue on without taking a rest.{nl}Mintz... please take the rear since the monsters may follow.
It doesn't look easy from here.{nl}There are many monsters in the hallway so let's be careful.
We ended up like this while moving fast to save the abbot...{nl}We will move again after we get some rest so please go first.
The old body of me can't endure as I unlocked two barriers consecutively.{nl}Shall we go to Prayer Room now?
It is so fortunate to see you are okay. {nl}Now, we should move the abbot out.
We barely saved the abbot.{nl}Thanks for your efforts.
The oratory can only be opened through the orb by Holy Power.{nl}Moheim is responsible of caring for the orb. I reckon he's somewhere near the palor.
It is impossible to open the oratory without the orb unless someone opens it from the inside.{nl}There is no way for the director to know about this fuss outside either.
Are you talking about the crystal sphere?{nl}I can't move it out at all so I hid it inside the monastery.
It's so good to recover the monastery, but when are we going to finish cleaning it...
It was a really important object so I put it in the box first.{nl}Inside the reception room. If you find it, please take it to Goss.
I have to protect this place so I can't go with you.{nl}There aren't many boxes so you will find it easily.
Yes. That's the crystal sphere.{nl}Please bring it to Goss.
Abbot
Thanks for resolving the crisis.{nl}I can feel the goddesses are protecting you.
So you've come. Soon, the abbot would come out.{nl}Please wait a bit here.
Why is the monastery like this and why are you all gathered here?{nl}And you... you seem to have some business with me.
He is the abbot of the Tyla Monastery.
We barely managed to come this far so I am hoping for good results.
So you are asking me to withdraw my declaration to protect Ebonypawn.{nl}You came this far to do that...
Okay. I will discuss this with the senior monks.{nl}Can you wait until then?
I will wait for their decision here first.{nl}If their declaration doesn't get withdrawn, then I should think about what to do at then.
So it seems that their discussion is over.{nl}Let's go there and listen to their conclusion.
We haven't finished our discussion.{nl}Please wait with the Hunters.
After we've discussed with the senior monks...{nl}We've decided to withdraw our declaration to protect Ebonypawn.
From this point on, Ebonypawn won't be protected by Tyla Monastery and we request Ebonypawn to leave at once.{nl}Also, we are not going to be involved with others' decision to punish him.
I hope the goddessess will be with you on your rest of journey.
Besides from the expulsion, we can't forgive his actions that ruined the monastery.{nl}We should find him since he should be here somewhere.
He made the monastery like this due to that letter. {nl}Please be careful.
He is so cunning..{nl}The Hunters are surrounding this place so he will get caught within a short period of time.
We would have had hard time without your help.{nl}Thank you so much for your efforts. I pray that the goddesses be with you on your journey.
If it wasn't for your help, the circumstances would have not been like this.
I've read it from the book before. {nl}Some smell has the power to pull the monsters.{nl}
I should've noticed when Ebonypawn brought that lump... I didn't expect that would be enlarged this big...{nl}We are eliminating them as we see them, but I want you to help us as well.{nl}
We are luring the monsters with the smell so it won't be effective if you just destroy them.{nl}Please destroy the lumps using this liquid medicine.
When I saw it, it was about the size of my palm so I don't understand how it got that big.{nl}This is all my fault...
I don't know how long it would take to drive those monsters out...{nl}But now is the time to start.
We were able to retrieve the monastery, but as you can see there are still full of monsters.{nl}Could you help us little more?
Orange Kowaks inside the monastery are most problematic.{nl}They are the most violent and vicious monsters among the monsters that came into the monastery.
They are still inside.{nl}Please eliminate the monsters including them.
The number of monsters won't increase from this point on.{nl}But, in order to eliminate them completely, we would need lots of time.
The goddesses helped us to retrieve the monastery.{nl}Lots of other sacred places are still occupied by many monsters.
It's a mess. {nl}The monsters are sweeping across the monastery so the books are all scattered.
When would we able to gather all these books again and divide them into different categories...{nl}If you pick up scriptures, please bring them to me.
You don't have to try hard.{nl}I can collect them.
Thanks.{nl}We should be able to gather all of them again right?

It seems that there are more monsters here now compared to when I moved out of the tower.{nl}I don't know what happened...{nl}
Good, good... I will make it activate itself only when the Petrifying Frost blow.{nl}I should obtain the nucleus of the detector somewhere.
If you could bring me the nucleus of the detector, I will do the rest.{nl}You've contributed a lot in this experiment so I will give you the effects of the symbol of schilt.{nl}Although it woud not last long...
Long time ago, it used be a big city when compared with Klaipeda or Fedimian.{nl}In terms of everything. It was also an important Trade District.{nl}
But, that was the story when the city used to belong to the humans. {nl}The monsters are adopting faster than the humans.
We can't even find the traces of the bodies of the victims who were {nl}sacrificed on the day of Ruklys' rebellion due to Petrifying Frost.{nl}Those angry souls are deeply permeated into the city.{nl}
Please light the bonfire that I set at Vienti Fortress.{nl}I may get a chance to talk to the spirits.
I've put the scent of butterflies that can be obtained from the deep inside Kateen Forest into the bonfire. {nl}It has the power to comfort the souls.
Even if one is in danger, if one knows that help is coming,{nl} one will have the extra energy to endure longer.
A suitable end for a crazy magician. It could have been dangerous without the defensive magic.{nl}He probably operated the wrong line, without knowing the first valve was destroyed...{nl}
Anyway, that's great.{nl}Since we've dealt with Antares, let's go up.
He was always curious about the secret of the tower.{nl}The reason why he was imprisoned was because he was too obsessed with that secret.
I think I can find a way if I have some Red Infrorocktor cores. {nl}I should be able to do something with those even without using magic.
I am sorry, but I can't explain the details.{nl}All I can say is if we use magic, we will be discovered by the demons.
Did you just see that monster explode?{nl}That's definitely strange. It's as if the power of its essence is out of control.
That vibration from a while ago keeps distracting me.{nl}I hope it's nothing.
When the demons' attacks started becoming serious, the goddess prepared this in advance.{nl}Fortunately, the device is working alright.
We're almost at the final floor so we just have to press forward a little more.{nl}The goddess must be enduring more than we are.
The Jewel of Prominence is now alright.{nl}I am... relieved.
You... you are the one Goddess Gabija is looking for!{nl}Please help me. If things continue as they are, we could lose the goddess and the Mage Tower to the demons.{nl}
In the past, the demons have aimed to take the Mage Tower.{nl}Though, we were always able to stop their attacks whenever they attacked.{nl}
But now it's different. Most of the wizards are either dead or have run away.{nl}Only Gabija and a few wizards are still remaining in the tower, protecting it.
This is the entrance to the tower.{nl}I won't be able to use magic, but I will definitely take you to Goddess Gabija.{nl}
Are you ready?
Gabija has not disappeared completely.{nl}To protect the tower from the demons, she just had to hide herself.{nl}
Because Agailla Flurry could not find her successor, she managed the tower.{nl}To protect a precious thing... she sacrificed herself.
I can do this alone.{nl}Until Gabija regains her powers again, I will maintain the tower here.
Okay, go to the fifth floor.{nl}Please pass the Jewel of Prominence to Gabija!
This cannot be done without me.{nl}I will somehow manage to hold the tower up, so please pass the Jewel of Prominence to Gabija!
What was that vibration?{nl}Could it be...
It's the vibration again!{nl}Antares... Now I know. When he exploded, the magic of the tower was disrupted.{nl}
The tower will collapse if we leave it like this.{nl}Let's quickly go to the Magic Control Room!
We should be careful from here.{nl}This floor used to be where Antares' laboratory was located.
I feel uneasy.{nl}Maybe, Antares has been released by the attacks of the demons...
I will do the work until Gabija retrieves her power.{nl}Go quickly!{nl}
We have no choice.{nl}We should give up on the Transport Magic Circles, and instead destroy the monsters that are rushing in.
Well done.{nl}However, this jewel is just an empty shell.{nl}You can complete it by empowering it with various materials.
Lastly, we need to collect Flame Sources.{nl}You can obtain them from the monsters that possess the power of fire.
I can feel a strange energy.{nl}It seems that the status of the Jewel of Prominence is not normal.
If Antares had used that power correctly, the Mage Tower would have not turned out like this.{nl}It is such a shame.
Oh yeah. There is also a diluting solution that I've ordered from the Item Merchant in Fedimian.{nl}Can you also bring that?
To glue stone together, we often use the sticky resin of Infrogalas Mages.{nl}But, you can't find them easily at the Namu Temple Ruins.{nl}
It would be easier to lure one from the sky than to try finding one without using a food box.{nl}Alternatively, you could just go to Viltis Forest.
When you go into the monastery, let's first secure the entrance of Prayer Room.{nl}I will leave when you are ready.
The old body of me can't endure as I unlocked two barriers consecutively.{nl}Shall we go to Prayer Room now?
It is so fortunate to see you are okay. {nl}Now, we should move the abbot out.
Prayer Room can't be opened from outside unless a person comes out from the room.{nl}That's why we should endow the sacred energy into the crystal sphere of the monastery when there is an emergency to let Prayer Room know.{nl}
Moheim is in charge of the crystal sphere. {nl}He is probably around the reception room.{nl}
The abbot in Prayer Room won't know about this.{nl}We should call him out through the crystal sphere.

You've dug the Metal Plate well!
I've been able to regain some of my power thanks to you, but this is only the beginning  -- {nl} I'll help protect you now by luring the demons with the fake revelation in this tower. {nl}
Please take Laima's revelation to the Great Cathedral. Believe in yourself and never hold any doubts.{nl} Victory will certainly be yours in the end.
Welcome. {nl} We're short on many things, so we have to make use of every bit we've got.
Mothstem? I've seen it in Fedimian Suburbs. {nl}Pardoner Master was also looking for it. Were you not able to find it yet?
Hurry back to the Pardoner Master. He has been looking for that Jar of Fire for a long time.
You mean the Jar of Fire? I know about it. {nl}But I won't give you any information for free. Maybe the hardened oil from the Blue Puragi in Saknies Plains could help me talk...
If you don't need it, then I also don't have a choice. {nl} I am a merchant, not a volunteer.
Oh, thank you very much. {nl} I heard that a monster called Mothstem has the Jar of Fire and it would never let go of it.
Um, I heard the Item Merchant saw it recently. You should go ask him about it.
What a disaster. It's so disappointing. {nl}A merchant like me may not fully understand what you're feeling but still...
For all that, do me a favor and I'll give you something nice. It may not be as great as the one you broke but still quite useful.
I'm not asking for a lot. {nl} You can see this in the signs the pilgrims make along Starving Demon's Way.
If no, then I've got nothing else. {nl} If we can, we will mutually profit.
You've come to want something, huh? {nl} An interesting life really depends on reckless challenges, huh?
Well, well. What have I been doing? {nl} Oh, my Liliya...{nl}
Her music box and necklace were snatched by Naktis' servants, and infused with Naktis' curse. {nl}It's as if they are trying to mock Maven's teachings.
Hold on, my head's ringing again from that curse. {nl} There's still so much to say... I don't know if I will be able to handle it right now.
Thank you very much. It's really gotten better. {nl} The music box.. My Liliya.. She may no longer be in this world. {nl}
If you run into any of Naktis' possessions, please be sure to carefully inspect them for her sake. {nl} The symbol of our love that the demon swallowed... Please accept it as our gratitude for helping us claim revenge.
That symbol is a necklace blessed by the Great Cathedral, so it must be very useful. {nl} To me, that necklace no longer holds any meaning.
Thanks for your kind words.{nl}I would really appreciate it if you could defeat the monsters here that are disturbing me.
Please test it on the monsters that reflect the light of souls.
If you use this medicine this time, the soul trapped in a monster's stomach will shine.{nl}When you defeat those monsters, the trapped soul will be freed.{nl}
Have you found the rest of the restrained souls?{nl}As I expected... this crafting recipe now belongs to you then.{nl}
Thank you.{nl}Our allies were taken to the nest at the right side of the Ishrai Crossroads.
You should walk around as much as you can.{nl} Flame Vapor only appears for a moment.
I've heard that some saw resentful souls.{nl}Maybe, they are souls that could not reach Goddess Ausrine... That's horrible.
So you are now one competent Rodelero.{nl}But, how about fighting a Colimencia... The one at the manor of Greene family.
When there are some things lacking, it means there is some room to improve.{nl}Don't worry. I can fill that in.
You would feel some weight of it.{nl}But, you should realize your deficiencies in order to become better Rodelero.{nl}
What you've done is really amazing.{nl}I am looking forward to see your growth as a Sadhu Master.
Dionys is too strong for us to face against.{nl}Even Vakarine won't be able to do anything if we go late.

Tenant Farmer Weiss hid the seeds that he secretly grew, but he can't go get them due to the monsters. Please bring the seed pouch from the Farm Plaza.
If I am going to fall tomorrow, I don't care if I risk my life today.
I am sure that they brought them to Drasos Chapel Ruins, but since we can't leave this place, we are going to die due to hunger.{nl}I am sorry, but can you retrieve the stolen supplies for us?
When we were in the era of Premier Eminent, we were supported by the superior troops, lots of supplies and etc.{nl}But, 600 years have passed after Premier Eminent died.{nl}
Would dead people come back if the curse is cured in this city?{nl}No, but the times after now are more important.
I understand their loyalty for the kingdom, but when I see them make people do impossible things that lead to deaths...{nl}I don't know who is the monster anymore.
If you could help me...{nl}Maybe we could save them even if they are cursed with the petrification. Although they may lose their arms.
Did you defeat it? Great job!{nl}Now I don't have to fear this place being torn down until another monster shows up.
Have you met Wilhelmina at Kovos Hall Site before?{nl}She is in charge of the Knights of Kaliss, but she is full of hatred towards the Royal Army guards.{nl}
We are in a good relationship with her since we work well together.{nl}We were able to plan this since she helped us well.{nl}
Can you hand over the records to Wilhelmina that you've brought?{nl}We told them that we would help penetrate into Gargoyle so don't forget to receive something before you come here. 
Finally, the records which weren't in hands of the Royal Army guards are here.{nl}
Is this... a love letter? {nl}I don't need it so you can take it or throw it away.{nl}
Hmm... It contains most of what we need. {nl}Please give this scroll to Amanda.{nl}
This is the scroll designed to face against Gargoyle.{nl}The sounds won't leak out no matter what  you do anything inside so you won't be detected by Royal Army guards.
The Knights of Kaliss possesses many competent wizards.{nl}They will give us what we need.
A scroll?{nl}I thought she'd give us something like a ballista or a magicial weapon...{nl}
But, this is the most effective method for now isn't it?
Please get rid of Gargoyle.{nl}I need to pack my bag at the Fortress of the Land.{nl}It will not be hard for you.
Object?{nl}Ah, it is a Monocle that lets you to see the true nature.{nl}We could probably find the room where the treasure is located with that easily right?
Object?{nl}Ah, it is a Monocle that lets you to see the true nature.{nl}We could probably find the room where the treasure is located with that easily right?
The scroll Wilhelmina gave us is awesome!{nl}I didn't hear a thing even from right beside.{nl}
Shall we enter the Fortress of the Land?{nl}Let's meet inside.
Spears are mighty and never lose.{nl}I want to see the guy's pitiful face after Shadow Gailer is dead.
I heard a monster called Biteregina is threatening people at Manocle Grave.{nl}What do you think? I hope you think of it as the price for learning my skills.
If you were to pick between a gun and a spear, which one would you choose?{nl}If I were you, I would choose both.
My soul is shredded and trapped in the seal. {nl}Defeat the Experimental Slime so I can get released.
Those pieces of another me lost the voices to call you.{nl}Please find my voice again from Arma.
Please release this seal.{nl}When you collect the Crystals of Restriction from Flask Mages and break them, the seal will be broken.
The contract needs to continue. Please release me.{nl}As those observers are defeated, my spirit becomes free.
I am here and all over the world.{nl}My soul was torn into pieces long ago.{nl}
Where are my other pieces...
Are you talking about the fire pot? I know it.{nl}But, I can't give it to you for free. Unless you could get me the condensed oil from Saknis Plains from Blue Puragis...
For my future disciple, I have prepared a nice gift at Starving Demon's Way.{nl}I hope you like it.
Very nice indeed.{nl}You have no problem understanding my spells.
The Thaumaturge Master told me to give it to you.{nl}If you hadn't done it, I would have kept it for myself... Such a pity.
I don't really mind the rumors, but do people really believe that a spell can preserve your youth? {nl}Well, maybe it can but... {nl}Ah, I don't want to talk about it anymore.
For the people who go on the way of the pilgrim with hope, this curse is so much pain for them.{nl}We don't even know the true nature of the curse so I am so mad.
I was so mad that there were no Revelators back then.{nl}But, after hearing that some Revelator saved the Mage Tower, my thoughts changed.{nl}
I think the goddess may come back when they complete their duties and I complete mine.
I didn't expect that the true intent of the curse cast on this forest is after the Great Cathedral.{nl}Fortunately, we were able to stop the curse due to one Revelator, but I feel ashamed.
The curse here is serious, but there are other places where the influence of the curse is more severe. {nl}The city of Ruklys... I heard everything there turns into stone due to the curse of petrification.
I think it was my fault that I left the Mage Tower to save the people after Medzio Diena.{nl}Maybe, instead of the Revelator, I could've saved the tower.
I heard the story about the Revelator who stopped the Demon Lord at the Great Cathedral.{nl}I guess... now there won't be any more people who suffer from the curse.
I've been to many places before in my life, but this place is really horrible.{nl}Even if I want to rescue the ones who are cursed, the only thing I can do is to help them fall asleep comfortably.
I heard a Revelator defeated the Demon Lord attacking the Mage Tower.{nl}That's the most positive news I've heard lately.{nl}All the other news I've heard were horrible.
Is it true that some Revelator defeated the Demon Lord who casted the curse in this region?{nl}If that's true, it is so fortunate since we don't have to see those horrible things again.
Oh no... What was I doing?{nl}Ahhh. My Liliya...{nl}
Don't mess with the food piles.{nl} He should have shuffled over here by now... Just keep watching.
While my brothers were on their way to train, they all died from the demons' tricks.{nl}I feel sorry for my brothers who can't return to the goddesses.{nl}
And they were so consumed with madness, even after their death, they could not even return to the goddesses.{nl}That's why I want to give them eternal sleep.{nl}
It was really horrible. Those brothers who used to be kind to each other, hurt and killed each other...{nl}And the demons cheated those brothers who were not led to the goddesses.{nl}
My brothers are blaming each other and crying out in madness even after their deaths.{nl}At the altar of the goddesses.{nl}
Death may be the price I pay for my sin. {nl}Even if it was due to the curse of the demons, it is still a sin I've committed.
I didn't want to... die like this... {nl}Mother...
I've realized after my death that my colleague left me because of the curse. {nl}This thing is now useless to me... Thank you.
Our squad is all dead because of my incompetence.{nl}I'm the only one left alive, but I don't that will stay true for long.
It looks like you've done more than Roy's part.{nl}If it wasn't for you, we would not have been successful.{nl}
They're all either dead or outta here.{nl}I bet I'm the only one left on this floor. Those cowards.
My body... Unfortunately, it doesn't belong to me.{nl}I regret my faults that I'd committed in the past because of my greed.
I hope you are okay.{nl}We are all done, but you are not.
But...{nl}It won't work with this material alone.{nl}We should also have the tools...
{nl}When you go to Orsha, there must be people who have the tools.{nl}Maybe the Blacksmith or the Equipment Merchant...?{nl}Can you go there?
Be careful on your journey.
The construction of the sanctum...
{nl}Hmm...
{nl}I would sell it by receiving the money, but I will just give it to you this time.{nl}However, just throw it away after using it since this is disposable after one use.
I'm relieved we got it back. {nl}I finally get to see the holy relic, even after death.{nl}
Please find my friend.{nl}I lived so hard until now, so I can't just die here.
Ruklys Army Officer's Spirit
Finally... The worst curse has been undone!
Good.{nl}Since the hideout is safe now, you can leave the Fortress of the Land.
That mean demon occupied our fortress.{nl}I feel so resentful. That magic circle... If we could only have the magic circle...{nl}
Okay... I can feel the same energy that I felt from Ruklys from you.{nl}
I will open the portal. {nl}I've hid the means to face against the demon across here.{nl}
Please hurry to the hidden place!
What is this? A protective magic circle? {nl}Only the stories regarding the magic circle are here.{nl}
Oh... I shouldn't have expected it. {nl}There's nothing here. We better go to the other district.{nl}
I will take a look around so let's meet at the habitants' district.
Well, shall we take a look around Monocle?{nl}If you can see something special, there must be something important there.
Can you bring more of these old bombs?{nl}I am not trying to use them for malicious purposes. I just want to do some research.
I will give you the tools to dismantle the bomb.{nl}If you break the detonator with those, you can bring the bombs safely.{nl}
I don't know how you found this bomb, but I think they've used a metal detector.{nl}When you investigate more with that, maybe we could find some remains.{nl}
Find the bombs using this metal detector and use the tools I gave to you to break the detonator.{nl}Then you would able to bring them safely. I am counting on you!
This must be more than a few hundreds years old.{nl}What were they trying to do with this bomb...{nl}Anyway, thanks! 
By the way, why did you come here?{nl}Since you don't say anything about it, this must be important right?{nl}
Anyway, let's go deeper inside.{nl}You should tell me later. Okay?
The demons didn't have special objects.{nl}What... you don't have them?
Revelator. {nl}After Medzio Diena, Vakarine's power has become weak, so we have to protect her.
This is not the world of the humans nor the world of demons, but another space of Vakarine...{nl}We have imprisoned the demons inside this prison who are evil to the world.{nl}
However, after Medzio Diena, Vakarine didn't have the power left to maintain this space.{nl}As you can see, this space is gradually collapsing and the dimensional crack is getting wider.{nl}
The Demon Lords who are locked in this prison are trying to escape here.{nl}Other demons who came here through the dimensional crack are joining them as well.{nl}
Vakarine desperately needs your help.{nl}Please help us with your strength to defeat the demons at this prison.
Please first stop the demons that are trying to release the Demon Lord Blut that is locked here.
Demon Lord Blut's servants are trying to help him escape here. {nl}Hauberk's help will be useful this time.
Right now, Kupole Zydrone is holding down Blut. {nl}But since Vakarine's power has waned after Medzio Diena, we are not like what we were before.{nl}
Fortunately, Blut hasn't been completely freed yet...{nl}However, we don't know how much longer we can endure by ourselves.{nl}
We have to somehow weaken the power of the Demon Lord Blut.{nl}I am sure his allies set the camp near Bjaurer Hideout.{nl}Please get the mark of Blut that they hold.
Our original duty was to supervise and manage the prison.{nl}But... now, we are trying our best to just hold back the demons. {nl}No matter what it takes.
So you are the one who Vakarine talked about.{nl}Well done. Everything will be done with goddess' will.
We've locked Blut across this barrier.{nl}
No demon besides Blut knows more about Vakarine's weakening than we do.{nl}Blut is not completely freed yet, so we now have an opportunity to get rid of him.{nl}
But, if we don't defeat Blut quickly, this barrier will collapse soon.{nl}Let's defeat him at once. Are you ready?{nl}
We were able to defeat Blut because of you.{nl}You brought us hope.{nl}
As you know, Vakarine's power is... really weak at the moment.{nl}If we had not defeated Blut here, we might not have been able to continue protecting Vakarine.{nl}
Alright. Please go to the 2nd District of the Prison.{nl}To defeat the next Demon Lord, I am sure Kupole Arune has prepared something.
The demons that lost Blut are causing a rampage. {nl}If they escape to the outside world, it will be a great disaster.
The barrier is gradually collapsing.{nl}I don't know what would happen even if we defeated the demons...
Good work. {nl}It's a relief that those demons did not notice the weakening of the crack to the outside world.
Human exploration teams came in from the outside world in the past. {nl}Unfortunately, they all died before we could do anything. {nl}
Humans should not ever come here.
So you are the Revelator Vakarine talked about. {nl}It is great that you aren't late.{nl}
The Demon Lord Nuaele's power is weakening the prison at an alarming rate.{nl}However, we Kupoles have no way to stop Nuaele now.{nl}
Also, Kupole Aldona told me that she couldn't just wait for the Revelator...{nl}Without the time for persuasion, she went after Nuaele.
Please stop the demons that are coming here through the dimensional crack.{nl}If you could stop them before they join Nuaele, it will be great help to the safety of Aldona.
Goddess.{nl}I hope nothing has happened to Aldona...
With her forces diminished, Nuaele's power should be weakened.{nl}Before anything happens to Aldona, I will tell you what to do next.
Nuaele is difficult to face head-on with only us.{nl}But Nuaele wasn't always that strong.{nl}
Nuaele became stronger only after obtaining the pieces of Hauberk's seal. {nl}Hauberk's servants who lost their master started to follow her since she had the pieces of the seal{nl}
Since then, Nuales started wielding her new mighty power,{nl}To Hauberk, she is like a traitor.{nl}
Knowing that, there should be a way to increase Hauberk's power.{nl} It's not a bad idea from Hauberk's point-of-view either.
Please go to the 2nd Isolation Area. {nl}I am sure Hauberk's former servants are gathered there.
I am sure the Demon Lord Nuaele is aware of this now.{nl}That the power of the others is not hers to keep.
Hmm... there's something that's been bugging me.{nl} When Nuaele collected power, she could've tried escaping immediately.{nl}
But, it seems that Nuaele is waiting for something.{nl}We should find out what she is planning.{nl}{nl}
Please interrogate the servants of Nuaele.{nl}Since Hauberk is also a demon, it will be easy to read their minds.{nl}It becomes even easier when they are in their spirit form.
It seems she's planned to make this prison her world from the beginning. {nl}If her plans succeed, even if Goddess Vakarine powers were restored, it would not be enough.
Now, please meet with Aldona. {nl}She will take you to Nuaele's territory.
Goddess Vakarine is waiting for you at the District 3.{nl}But, I feel somewhat uneasy since she is so stubborn.
In the past, she told us that she couldn't just not do anything, even if her power was weakened.{nl}We barely managed to persuade her.{nl} 
To prevent something from happening to Vakarine, please move to the District 3 as quickly as possible.{nl}
The dimensional crack and the Demon Lords... they were inevitable.{nl}I could feel my power becoming weaker after Medzio Diena and I had to find some way.{nl}
I have given my Dionys great power that should not be stolen by the Demon Lord.{nl}But, that power was so strong, it started to control Dionys...{nl}
I cannot tell you details about that power at this moment.{nl}But, please just know that this power that is controlling Dionys is the only way to close the dimensional crack.{nl}
Please complete the Evening Star Key with Kupole Zydrone.{nl}With the Evening Star Key, Dionys could regain his control back over that power.
Savior!{nl}I have been waiting for you. {nl}
The strong power controlling Dionys' ego was to never fall into the hands of the demons.{nl}Not to mention Dionys is like a powerful guardian to Vakarine.{nl}
But, it was important to stop the demons...{nl}She had no choice, but to make a heart-aching decision.
We have decided to seal Dionys and its power until the prison regains stability...{nl}
We don't know what that power is exactly.{nl}But, we know that it can be used to close the dimensional crack and should not be taken away.{nl}
Fortunately, we could detach that power if we put holy power into the Evening Star Key.{nl}Are you ready?
Dionys is the guardian whom Vakarine most adores.{nl}She reluctantly sealed the strong power to Dionys and fell into the deep sadness...
Now go to Oruarma Cathedral. {nl}Protect me from the demons while I focus the goddess' power into the Evening Star Key.
Here. Please give this key to Kupole Aldona. {nl}She must be holding down Dionys now. Please hurry.
You are not too late!{nl}Let's release the power of the Evening Star Key.{nl}
When you unleash the seal, the power that is held in the key will be collected to this magic suppressor.{nl}I want you to release the seals at Rearda, Kasa, and Rada.
Dionys is not someone we can face against.{nl}Even Vakarine in her old days would not be able to do anything.
The power of the Evening Star Key is accumulating in the magic suppressor.{nl}We are all ready and there's plenty of time.
We are going to detach the power from Dionys now.{nl}If we fail, it would be as if tens of Demon Lords were let loose.{nl}
As such, we need to approach this with caution. {nl}Let me know when you are ready.
Hauberk fled towards District 4, which is under Daiva's watch. {nl}First, you should return to Vakarine. I will look for Dionys.
Savior. {nl}The time has come for you to know the truth.{nl}The power which I gave to Dionys is called the Chain of Reversion.{nl}
The Chain of Reversion is the wonder that connects every boundary of anything...{nl}Hauberk probably wants to use the Chain of Reversion to restitch his spirit together.{nl}
However, Hauberk too is the key to closing the dimensional crack.{nl}The reason why I left him the way he was, was to store power for the key's functions.{nl}
Hauberk hasn't accumulated all of his spirit yet, so he wouldn't be hard to face against.{nl}Catch him again and close the dimensional crack with the Chain of Reversion.{nl}
The District 4 which he ran away to is like a maze. {nl}Kupole Daiva and you would be able to follow him though.
How could Vakarine let Hauberk go on a rampage like that...{nl}Well, I guess she must have a reason for that?
The Oruarma Cathedral is where the goddess recovers her powers. {nl}That is why it should always be safe from the demons. Thank you very much.
Please collect the pieces of the Mark of Star that are scattered near Rada Seal.{nl}It will help the goddess recover her powers.
Thanks. {nl}If Vakarine recovers, then Dionys should also recover.
So you've come, Savior.{nl}Fortunately, Hauberk seems to be not focused on leaving this place through the dimensional crack.{nl}That means he is not complete yet enough to go out through the dimensional crack.{nl}
I think...{nl}What if he wanted to escape without going through the dimensional crack you came here with...{nl}You should look for the crack which has been weakened due to the collapse.{nl}
The weakest part now is at Nebilau Broken District, so he probably went there.{nl}Please follow him, I will prepare the next step while you do so.
Even if Hauberk does something, it can only be inside the prison.{nl}Hauberk could never run away.
With this Night Star Spectral Orb, we can easily find Hauberk.{nl}If Hauberk gives up and tries to run away, I will do my best to block it. {nl}
I won't be able to stop Hauberk completely, but...{nl}I will try to buy as much time as possible for the Savior.
If Hauberk gives up and tries to run away, I will do my best to stop him. {nl}
I won't be able to stop Hauberk completely, but...{nl}I will try to buy as much time as possible for the Savior.
Fortunately, he did not come to my side and he moved as I thought.{nl}With the Savior's power, we can surely catch him.
It was a success!{nl}If Hauberk can think straight, he should know he has no time to waste defeating Sigita.{nl}At least, let's hope that's the case.
There is only one way out from here.{nl}It will be our great chance to catch Hauberk.{nl}
Push Hauberk into the Galutin Solitary Confinement.{nl}Since Kupole Sigita is blocking Hauberk's exit at the opposite side, you need not to worry about his escape.{nl}
Well done.{nl}Hauberk didn't know what to do when he saw me and ran away to the Galutin Solitary Confinement.{nl}
Now, Hauberk would be able to defeat me easily...{nl}But, I guess he thought the Revelator would catch up to him right away.{nl}
However, the way up from here is a dead end.{nl}Tell me if you are ready to catch Hauberk.
Well done.{nl}We will collect Hauberk's sealed strong power now and take it to Vakarine.{nl}
Vakarine is getting ready to close the dimensional crack with the other Kupoles.{nl}She is desperately waiting for you, so please hurry to the District 5 of the prison.
I need proof to show to Vakarine we've been fighting here.{nl}Can you collect a Demon's Tooth in Hradeti Crossroads?
Thank you. {nl}Please keep this a secret from Vakarine.
Savior.{nl}We really appreciate your help in stopping Hauberk.{nl}Because of you, we are now able to close the dimensional crack and retrieve the spirit of Hauberk and the Chain of Reversion.{nl}
Please do not feel sympathy towards Hauberk.{nl}It is sad that his spirit was torn apart, but he too was a demon to be eliminated.{nl}
Good. Now this is the last stage... We need to close the dimensional crack.{nl}With your help, we will be able to prevent catastrophe in this prison.{nl}
Please prepare, since we will soon start the ritual to seal the dimensional crack.
We must supplement Hauberk's sealed spirit by adding the power of demons nearby.{nl}
I would give you the Evening Star Rune, but that is an object that uses my power...{nl}Which means it is not perfectly working yet.{nl}
Defeat the demons at Ausura Chapel and collect traces of the transference.{nl}With those, I would be able to complement my lacking power and complete the Evening Star Rune.
Thanks to you, I can now complete the Evening Star Rune.{nl}Take it. You should collect the souls of the demons with the Evening Star Rune.{nl}{nl}
You must go to the Lankine Separation District, the Ishisula Broken District and the Hehmastar Isolation District.{nl}I will send the Kupoles once you suppress the demons there using the power of the Evening Star Rune.
Once you do so, they will receive the souls that are needed to close the dimensional crack.{nl}{nl}
This is a place where originally humans are not allowed to enter. {nl}But, you are special and thus granted permission by Vakarine.
Vakarine should recover soon...{nl}She was already tired and has gotten weaker due to the battle with Nuaele.
This prison was created by Goddess Ausrine.{nl}Vakarine comes here periodically and manages this place.
Oh... my poor Dionys... I am so sorry for giving you this big burden.
We weren't able to monitor all the demons in the prison.{nl}That's why we engraved Sealing Tokens on them so they couldn't unleash their power.
Hauberk's spirit has become strong enough to handle the dimensional crack because of your efforts.{nl}The Chain of Reversion is also ready.{nl}
We will close the dimensional crack now.
The Kupoles and I will try our best to seal the dimensional crack.{nl}This is our only chance... if we fail this time, we may not have another chance.{nl}
I repeat, this is the last chance for the demons to make a counter-attack.{nl}Until the dimensional crack completely seals off, please resist their attacks.{nl}{nl}
Every disaster that struck this land is over now.{nl}Savior. We owe everything to you. {nl}
Everything stemmed from our arrogance.{nl}When Laima warned us that a time of hardship would come...{nl}I believed in myself so much that I could not understand what she meant.{nl} 
But, your sacred energy tells me everything.{nl}I believe it will be your power and not us that will save this world.{nl}
I cannot be of any help due to the circumstances.{nl}But, I will stay here and do my best until the Day of Salvation.{nl}
There is one more thing, though.{nl}The dimensional crack that was engraved here is also engraved at various places in your world.{nl}The most dangerous place among them now is Dina Bee Farm..{nl}
My sister Austeja is having a hard battle alone.{nl}Please also help her as you have helped me.
Once Dionys recovers, Vakarine will feel less pressured.
Thank you.{nl}If Dionys recovers completely, it'll be all thanks to you.
Can you deal with the dimensional crack at Gavara Isolation District?
Wait a minute. {nl}The Knights of Kaliss told us that the important thing is located deep inside the fortress.{nl}
We should go move deeper inside so we can start working on what we are both looking for.{nl}I will try looking for the outpost area with this monocle. {nl}
Hmm... there's nothing special.{nl}Instead, there are many Royal Army guards.
There are too many Royal Army guards to go further inside.
We should lure the Royal Army guards in order to go deeper inside.{nl}Hmm...{nl}
That's right. We have Resounding Bombs!
Resounding Bombs make really loud sounds although their explosiveness isn't that great.{nl}When you detonate them at various places, the soldiers should move to the locations where the sounds come from.{nl}
I don't have Resounding Bombs at the moment, but I can make them if I have necessary materials. {nl}For example, if I have Herbs and bombs. {nl}
I will look for the bombs so I want you to look for the herbs.{nl}Be careful not to be detected by the Royal Army guards.{nl}
When you collect all the herbs, let's meet at the lower side of the hallway at the upper floor.
The Royal Army guards are on patrol so you should be careful all the time.{nl}I am sure they are busy getting hit instead of explaining for the situation.
You brought them well without getting detected by the Royal Army guards.{nl}I am sorry. When they get hot, they make loud sounds.
Okay. Shall we start the work of the grave robbers?{nl}I saw the Royal Army guards have more bombs than they can handle.{nl}You know what that means, right?{nl}
No. no. We are not that kind of people. {nl}We don't mean to send them to the goddesses...{nl}
We just want to knock them out and take the bombs. {nl}You can do it right?
I will get ready to make Resounding Bombs.{nl}Just knock them out and bring the bombs. Okay?
Even if you get caught by the Royal Army guards, don't tell them about me.
Good. It's not like they've been detected right?{nl}I will make the Resounding Bombs so wait a bit.{nl}If this works out, we can move deeper inside.
We've completed the Resounding Bombs. {nl}If these detonate well, the Royal Army guards will {nl}move to the locations where the sounds came from. {nl}We will use that moment to head deeper inside.
Here are the Resounding Bombs. I've made them quickly so I can't guarantee their stability.{nl}Please set them well at the hallway on the upper floor and the lower side of the gathering place.
You should be careful since I can't guarantee their stability...
Have you set all of them?{nl}Let's wait until they explode.
The Resounding Bombs should be exploding soon.{nl}Cover your ears since they make a loud boom when they explode.
We don't have time to waste. Let's hurry!
Phew...{nl}I guess the Royal Army guards won't be able to chase after us here.{nl}
We should pray that what we are looking for should be inside. {nl}Go first. Let's meet at Drill Ground of Confliction!
You are an outsider... but, thanks for rescuing me.{nl}
Monsters are going crazy due to the loud sounds.{nl}They were almost annihilated.
If we go by principles, you guys should be punished by kingdom orders.{nl}But, since you've saved me and many of our colleagues have failed...{nl}
The safety of our colleagues is more important than your punishment.{nl}If you help us reclaim our camp, then we will forget about the punishment.
First, rescue our fallen colleagues.{nl}
If you run away, we'll be in big trouble, so, a soldier will be accompanying you.{nl}We shall take care of your colleague.{nl}
Don't do anything stupid.
When our colleagues gather again, we are going to retrieve our camp.{nl}There were many monsters from the beginning, but I've never seen them going crazy like that.
Thank you for rescuing our colleagues, but we haven't retrieved the camp yet.{nl}
Please help us little more. {nl}It's not a request. It is an order.
This place is being protected by the kingdom secretly.{nl}We here too are composed of the selected members from the kingdom.{nl}
We are going to reclaim the camp and try our best not to be conquered again. {nl}By doing so, we would be able to protect ourselves from monsters and intruders like you.{nl}
We need some temporary weapons and armors.{nl}
Many pieces of equipment were dropped on the ground while fighting against enemies.{nl}While I am taking care of my colleagues, please pick up that equipment.
We also have our pride and fame. {nl}We are going to reclaim our camp so that the sacrifices of our colleagues won't be lost in vain.
Thank you for collecting the equipment.{nl}We are also ready to reclaim the camp.
Okay. We will begin now.{nl}If you are scared, you can hide behind us. Let's go!
Monsters are getting ready at our camp.{nl}Be careful since they are not easy to defeat.{nl}
Okay. Let's go in!
I am sorry for not recognizing you.{nl}Your skills are so astonishing.{nl}
If It wasn't for that sudden attack, we would have not lost the camp.{nl}
We can't just relax even though we've reclaimed the camp.{nl}We don't know when the monsters will attack again.{nl}
But, my colleagues are too tired.{nl}You should help us until we organize the camp again.
It will be simple if you could place a barricade.{nl}It would help stop the monsters for a while.
There is wood inside the supply box so please set the barricade with that.
I've told you before, but you can't be at the Fortress of the Land.{nl}I am going to be quiet about the trespass since you've helped us so please leave at once.{nl} 
If you resist, we would have to execute the kingdom order.
If a person becomes a handful of soils after his death, can you imagine how he will be treated.{nl}The soils that once conquered this world...
Yes. You managed to avoid being like me. Yes...
Please hide.
I just hope the chasers won't find this place.
We can't trust the demons anymore...
You better get the black herbs fast.
The priests are only concentrating on the altars so they don't care whether we die in hunger or not.{nl}They think everything will be solved if they pray hard.{nl}That's why we decided to take an action.
It is most definitely sinful to obtain the revelation in this manner.{nl}But of course, this is the only way to obtain Maven's fourth key.
We should find out whether it is just a symbol, or if it is endowed with some kind of power.{nl}First, I want you to collect Lizardmen leather from the Abandoned Grape Farm.
Recently, we saw a similar looking girl at the Crystal Mine. {nl}But, strangely, she wasn't able to say anything.
Lizardmen are monsters that appeared in great number ever since Medzio Diena.{nl}If some kind of power is in this tree, it will definitely react to their leather.
Revelator, this is astonishing!{nl}When I apply the tree's power to the monster leathers that you brought, the leathers corroded right away.
Help me, please.{nl}I have to harvest, but my crops will all die soon because of the poison.
You are not... a messenger.{nl}This place is a military district, but we desperately need help these days.{nl}
It seems that you are quite competent.{nl}Can you help us a bit?
Thanks.{nl}There's one thing you need to know about this place.{nl}
This place is the strategic location which was built when Ruklys caused the chaos.{nl}Eminent who was the prime minister at that time came up with it to block their marching route. {nl}
They are maintained to block monsters or demons nowadays.{nl}Ever since Medzio Diena, we have not received any supplies or orders from the kingdom.{nl}
How could he just abandon his duty as a person who belongs to the kingdom?{nl}Our duty is to protect the magic circle here when some incident occurs here.{nl}
Actually, we were having hard time since we didn't have any forces to look for the subordinate who went missing after going there to repair it.{nl}His name is Higgs. Please look for him.
Are you the one sent by the commanding officer?{nl}I'll be alright now!
I think it is near Udringal Empty Lot.{nl}I am worried about whether he is wounded in this cold weather.
While he was going to do his duty, he was attacked by monsters. {nl}It will be hard to carry out the mission in his condition or go back alone.{nl}
Please help me so that I would be able to return safely.
I am thankful to the goddess that Higgs came back alive. {nl}But who would do his duty...
I've told you before...{nl}The duty of our squad is to protect the magic circle that can completely seal off this place.{nl}
It was Higgs' duty to maintain the magic circle, but he can't do it since he is wounded.{nl}And everyone is getting tired due to the coldness... I want you to help us.
Among the four shrines of Romuva Magic Circle, please activate one of them.{nl}However, in case monsters touch it and something bad happens, we will be in trouble.{nl}
So it changes all the time which one should be activated, but it won't be that hard.{nl}What do you think? Do you want to give it a try?
You are doing better than Higgs.{nl}Can you help us one more time?
Romuva isn't the only magic circle.{nl}We've sent our subordinates to the Neres Magic Circle as well, but I think the magical power has ran out.{nl}
It's not like we don't have any method, but the method is too much for our subordinates who've become weak...{nl}The only one I can trust is you now.
Just defeat the monsters near the magic circle. {nl}The vitality would be replaced to magical power. I am counting on you this time.
The thing that bothers us the most is not monsters nor the maintenance of the magic circle.{nl}The severe coldness is our biggest enemy.
We appreciate your efforts on behalf of the kingdom.{nl}They should work alright for some time.{nl}
If you meet a person from the kingdom on your journey,{nl}can you tell that person that we're diligently carrying out our duty here?{nl}May the goddess protect you.{nl}
The attacks of monsters won't just stop along with the supplies that are not coming.{nl}All we can do is just barely blocking their attacks. {nl}
I am sorry, but could you stop the monsters?
Everyone is exhausted due to the cold winds and monsters.{nl}I don't know how much longer we can survive.
Thank you for your efforts.{nl}I think the monsters have gotten weaker because of your help.
We are most worried about the coldness.{nl}We have food, but we are worried about our clothes.{nl}Chilly air comes into the holes in our uniforms.{nl}
Can you hunt for Trufflelia at Uzali Crossroads?{nl}Their hairy leathers are very warm.
We should self supply as much as we can.{nl}Although this place is remote from the mainland, we know what's going on in the kingdom. 
Thanks.{nl}I already feel warm.
Thanks for rescuing me. {nl}I saw you fighting while I was chasing after you and you are really great.{nl}
I have a simple request to you.{nl}All of my colleagues are exhausted. I am exhausted as well. {nl}
To warm our bodies, we should light up a fire, but the flint can no longer be used.{nl}Can you get some flint from Tinaga Stone?{nl}{nl}
You haven't found them yet?{nl}Go to Tinaga Stone, north of the Uzali Crossroads.
Thanks. {nl}I owe you a lot.
Are you going to the camping ground?{nl}Ah, I am Rochez and I am responsible for the contacting Mesafasla and Stogas squads.{nl}
While I was returning with the letter, we met a herd of monsters.{nl}I think I will be recovered if I take a rest for a while, but I have to deliver the letter quickly...{nl}
For now, you are the only one we can trust.{nl}Please pass this letter to Commanding Officer Ades.{nl}
Ah, if you are okay with it, please defeat the monsters on your way.{nl}I have problem fighting against the monsters in my current condition.
I will be okay if I take little more rest.{nl}I am worried about the monsters and the letter.
Stogas Commanding Officer Ades
You've brought the letter from Mesafasla?{nl}What happened to Rochez?{nl}
Ah... I'm glad to hear that you are okay.
You have been an outsider for a long time {nl}There has been no supply from the kingdom, we don't know what's going on.{nl}
Even I'm trying to stand by doing self-sufficiency, but It's hard to alive only myself.{nl}If you are okay, please solve the lack of food.
Please get the meat from Beadbird around here.{nl}Horas told me It has a good taste.{nl}
We will starve, if the Beadbird.{nl}Here is too cold, so only potatoes are growing.
Thank you.{nl}First, we have to complete it.
We are not only just lacking food.{nl}Because we received no supplies from the camp, there has been a shortage of weaponry.
But, there's more than one way to skin a cat.{nl}We can make caltrops using the old prison fragments.{nl}
If you are okay, please collect something useful?
A long time ago, this prisoner was transferred to Kalejimas.{nl}A very depressing time during the era of King Kadumel.
It will be okay, if it was moved since Ruklys' rebellion.{nl}Before that, many people were taken to do forced labor.{nl}
Is the Crystal Mine nearby Klaipeda?{nl}Actually that place is one of the work places.{nl}The Ashaq Prison is nearby Orsha as well.
I feel kind of my blood froze when looking at the fragments of prison.{nl}It is kind of feel the grudge...
Thank you so much.{nl}
As a soldier, I feel uncomfortable to receive help from an ordinary person like you, but...{nl}Horace, who was helping us is lying in the tent at the moment.{nl}
He was dispatched here from the kingdom to help our squad.{nl}After Medzio Diena, even when the contact from the kingdom was lost, he helped us a lot.{nl}
He is sick after eating something wrong while he was looking for anything that could replace food.{nl}He should be recovered soon... Since the circumstances are bad, we want to receive help from you.
First, we should do something about his fever. {nl}A long time ago, Horace once told us that the body fluid of Worgs reduce the fever so let's try that out.
I hope it proves to be effective.{nl}I feel sad to see him sick.
Acquired it.{nl}We should have obtained it before you, but we don't have enough people...{nl}I will give it to him immediately.
Fortunately, it seems to be effective.{nl}Since he came out from the camp, why don't you talk to him?
This place is full of threats from monsters and the severe coldness.{nl}Also, the contact from the kingdom disappeared and the supplies are not reaching here.{nl}
Even so, the reason why I am doing my duty here is that...{nl}Because this is the last place where we could block attacks from the demons and the monsters.{nl}
If we block this road where there's danger lurking around,{nl}it will be hard since the demons and the monsters cross here in mass.{nl}If we give up on this place, we have no more way of blocking them.
We are protecting this place since we should guarantee the safety of the kingdom.{nl}
Of course, there are many soldiers who fled away without enduring...{nl}We are going to protect this place til the end.
You've brought it for me right?{nl}Thank you so much.{nl}
Monsters were okay after consuming it...{nl}I guess it was a mistake to think humans would be alright as well.{nl}
For the continuous flow of food supplies to this squad, there's something I want to test out.{nl}Can you help me a bit?{nl}
From a long time ago when famine comes, people ate barks inside trees.{nl}That was possible in an extreme situation, {nl}but we don't know when the situation would turn extreme.{nl}
I will give you a small dagger so please peel off the barks from the 2nd work place.
I am planning to develop various recipes using the barks.{nl}Whenever I eat meats, my gum starts to bleed and I feel weakened.
Thanks.{nl}I am trying to experiment it as I recover, but...{nl}I guess we should hope the kingdom contact us before that. 
When we were constructing this location, there was a building that was used to manage the workers.{nl}Our squad is using it for cargo instead.
But, from one day, Sparnashorn started to appear so we can't get near it.{nl}Of course, we can all rush in at the same time and get rid of them...{nl}
But, the problem is that we have lots of more important and emergent matters to take care of at the moment.{nl}The supplies are still in that cargo.
Everyone gave up on that cargo so it will cheer everyone up.{nl}
Sparnashorn is very strong and vicious so don't push too hard.{nl}We always feel cold and hungry so don't worry too much.
You've defeated it!{nl}We better let our colleagues know fast so let's go to the cargo to get the goods.

By the way, what is the thing that you are looking for?{nl}I guess it's important since you don't say anything about it.{nl}
Did you find something special from the demons?{nl}
What? There isn't anything?
Our family is different from those Dico thieves.{nl}Although we break some rules in order to survive.
Fencer Master
So you've come here to learn the skills of the Fencer.{nl}That's good to hear. I welcome anyone who wishes to learn.
We, Fencers, are faster than anyone and we take away the lives of enemies with accurate attacks.{nl}People think that we are splendid, but we always put our best efforts continuously.{nl}
I will test you to see whether you are strong on basics.
Good. Continue to defeat the monsters in the Forest of Prayer.{nl}You may become bored, but those basics are most important.
The monsters in the Forest of Prayer are not easy.{nl}Prove your competence.
Very good. You seem to be ready to learn.{nl}I will start to teach you from this moment.
Even if one can damage many foes at once, it is meaningless unless one is able to finish them all off.{nl}Don't you agree?
Defenses? Well, about that...{nl}Unless you can land a strike on us Fencers, there's no need for us to think about it.
Ignas... I feel like throwing up when I heard that he allied with the demons.{nl}I will spread his evil plans no matter what it takes.
If we take a little more rest, we would be able to move soon.{nl}Until then, we will pray to the goddesses so that we wouldn't get discovered.
Alina... Grazina...{nl}I hope they are okay...
Okay, so everything is ready.{nl}Now, how can we penetrate through Gargoyle...
I will pray that your plan will succeed.{nl}We also have high expectations.
Premier Eminent...{nl}I am sure that there is a reason why his name has been kept mentioned.
The important things are probably hidden deep inside the fortress.{nl}Go first. I will follow you soon.{nl}
There are so many soldiers here than we expected.{nl}Be careful.. Don't get spotted. Let's meet inside.
Go first to the habitants area.{nl}I will take a look around more.
What do these scrolls imply.{nl}There are many demons these days, but were they trying to protect something?
Shh, be quiet.
I will do my best to survive and go back to Orsha.{nl}Then, I will be able to continue the will of Lydia Schaffen.
You better obtain some black herbs.
Quick and Accurate [Fencer Advancement]
Something is solidified hard inside the pile of soil.{nl}Please make a shovel using the materials nearby!
Talk with the Fencer Master
Meet with the Fencer Master in the Forest of Prayer.
The Fencer Master wants to test your basic skills. Go to the Forest of Prayer and defeat the monsters to prove your skills.
Report to the Fencer Master
You've defeated enough monsters as Fencer Master requested to you. Go back to Fencer Master.
Welcome to the world of Centurions.{nl}Let's learn about formations one by one.
If your determination is not strong enough, then you better give up now.{nl}If that's not the case, first defeat Devilglove who is roaming around here somewhere.
Move yourself one step closer to the goddesses by giving a donation.{nl}May their blessings be with you always.
Do you want to learn superior magic of the Psychokino?{nl}I am not sure if you possess such skills.{nl}In order to improve your magical skills, you better learn how other Psychokinos investigate.
There are some books which the Psychokino left at the Mage Tower.{nl}I am sure those books will be helpful to you.{nl}Go to the Mage Tower and come back after reading those books.
Go to the Mage Tower and come back after reading the books of the Psychokino.
Were the books helpful?{nl}
You seem to be ready.{nl}Good. I will teach you the superior magic of the Psychokino.
So you've come here to learn about the superior magic of the Linker, right?{nl}
If that's the case, why don't you help me with my previous task?{nl}This goes for all the Linkers and I want you to be a part of it.{nl}
There is a material that is necessary in order to proceed to the next level {nl}from the research of Linker magic which I was previously doing.{nl}Please get me the crystal of the distorted spirit from Manahas, {nl}and the fragments of confusing emotions from Genar Field.
Please get me the crystal of the distorted spirit from Manahas and the fragments of confusing emotions from Genar Field.
Have you obtained all of them?{nl}
This is enough.{nl}Because of your help, we can now research easier and faster.
Now, I will tell you how to use the superior magic of the Linker.{nl}Pay attention and do not miss a thing!
You want to learn more magic of the Thaumaturge?{nl}I'm liking your attitude, but there's a limit to what I can tell you.{nl}You need to realize this yourself.
If you participate yourself into a hard battle, you may realize something from it.{nl}Go to Mage Tower 1F and face against Salamander.
It won't be easy.{nl}That beast is dangerous, so be careful.
When you come back after defeating Salamander from Mage Tower 1F, you will realize something.
Very good indeed.{nl}
You must have realized something from this battle.{nl}Concentrate while thinking hard on it.{nl}I will show you the new magic of the Thaumaturge.
You want to learn more magic of the Elementalist?{nl}I'm happy to hear that you're eager to learn more, because that says about your attitude.{nl}If you're not ready for it, you may be detrimental to you.{nl}But, it seems like you really need a higher level of practical experience.
I've heard that there is a powerful monster named Reaverpede in Escanciu Village.{nl}If you come back after defeating Reaverpeade, I will become a valuable asset to you.{nl}I wish you good luck.
The Reaverpede at Escanciu Village isn't easy, be cautious.
You've done well.{nl}
Now, I can relax and teach you some magic.{nl}Look closely at what I am about to show you.
You want to learn superior skills of the Sapper?{nl}Hmmm... I'm not convinced yet. {nl}How about a test first?{nl}
There's nothing better than real battles in order to test one's skills.{nl}Please come back after defeating Biteregina at Owl Burial Ground.{nl}It is very strong so be careful.
Good.{nl}I will wait here and pray for your safe return.
You just come back after defeating Biteregina at Owl Burial Ground.
Very good.{nl}
As I promised to you before, I will show you superior skills of the Sapper.{nl}Pay attention to what I am about to show you.
You said you wanted to learn the superior skills of the Hunter?{nl}Yes. I believe that you are capable of learning those skills.{nl}However, first do me a favor before I will teach you the new skills.
Try dealing with monsters at Starving Demon's Way, Pilgrim Path, {nl}Altar Way, Forest of Prayer and Apsimesti Crossroads.{nl}Dealing with a variety of monsters is necessary knowledge for {nl}a Hunter in order to remain calm under any circumstance.
So were they easy for you?{nl}
Alrigt, as promised, I will teach you the superior skills of the Hunter.{nl}I bet you are a fast learner.
You want me to teach you new skills of the Wugushi?{nl}Then you better learn the methods on how to make new poison.{nl}You will be able to create very strong poison if you use the poison of the monsters.
Okay. Take this pot first.{nl}Just put the monsters that have poison into these pots, but the poison will disappear if they die so you should catch them alive.{nl}
But, it's hard to force them into pots.{nl}When a monster's HP is reduced to less than half, {nl}then it will become easier to put them into pots.
Just get some monsters with poison into this pot.{nl}The poison will disappear if they die so you should catch them alive.{nl}You will easily put them into pots when their HP is less than a half.
Good.{nl}This will be enough.{nl}
Okay then. I will teach you the new skills of the Wugushi.{nl}Before I will teach you, I request you to focus...
Do you want to learn more skills of the Scout?{nl}Good. I like your attitude.{nl}
Now, I will test your reconnaissance skills.{nl}Just reconnoiter at the place I will tell you.{nl}You can do it right?
Go to the Mage Tower and visit all the places in the records to see if there's anything.{nl}Just write down in the records how the places are.{nl}Each floor has one place so just don't forget to record every places.
Go to the Mage Tower and just write down how the conditions are at those places.{nl}Each floor has one such place so don't forget to write down all of them.
You've done well.{nl}
Not only your movements, but your reconnissance skills are very good.{nl}I can conclude that you are able to learn the new skills of the Scout well enough.{nl}Let us concentrate.
So you've come here to learn about the superior magic of the Thaumaturge?{nl}I am surprised to see that you are already at that level.{nl}
I am not suspecting you, but you must pass one of the tests of Thaumaturge.{nl}The objective of this test is to see whether you could control the magical power stably.
There's a test place which I've prepared for you when you go to Laukyme Swampy Place.{nl}Go to that place and move the magic condensing sphere to put it on top of the magic circle.{nl}If you don't control it well, it may fly away to somewhere or you may fail so be cautious.
Go to Laukyme Swampy Place and move the magic condensing sphere to put it on top of the magic circle.{nl}If you don't control it weill, it may fly away or you may fail so be cautious.
I knew that you were going to do well.
Now, I will teach you the superior magic of the Thaumaturge so concentrate to learn well.
An Elementalist is adept at many attributes to control various elements, {nl}but it doesn't control all attributes. If you wish to learn the superior magic of the Elementalist, {nl}I should test to see whether you are competent enough to face against other attributes{nl}that we are not familiar with and show your skills.
There is a strong boss monster at Poslinkis Forest. {nl}Its name is Netherbovine and it has a Darkness elemental property. {nl}Defeat Netherbovine to prove me your skills.
You are way better than I expected.{nl}
You are qualified to learn the superior magic of the Elementalist.{nl}I will teach them to you right away.
You've already reached the level to learn the superior skills of the Wugushi?{nl}This is very surprising.{nl}But, lastly, I should test to see if you possess such skills.{nl}
Come back after defeating Rajatoad at Demon Prison District 1.{nl}If you are competent enough to learn the superior magic of the Wugushi, you're able to do it.
Rajatoad isn't an easy foe.{nl}Be careful.
I now have to acknowledge your skills.{nl}
Good. I can't say otherwise.{nl}As I promised to you, I will teach you superior skills of the Wugushi.
You want to learn the superior skills of Scout?{nl}Then, I will test your battle skills now.{nl}You should fight well in order to survive from dangers.{nl}
Come back after defeating Deadborn at Demon Prison District 1.{nl}It is very strong, but you should be able to defeat it in order to learn the superior skills of Scout.
If your battle skills are not high enough, an irrevocable result may come when you fact against a danger.{nl}I hope you can protect yourself.
Come back after defeating Deadborn at Demon Prison District 1.{nl}It will not be easy, but I have thrust in you that you will defeat it.
Your battle skills are amazing.{nl}
I will teach you the superior skills of Scout right away.{nl}You will be able to learn fast.

If the path to the Gateway of the Great King is safe then I will be able to see more people.{nl}
A true Cataphract is the first warrior that steps up and fights in the front lines. {nl}If anything gets in your way, just strike it all down.{nl}
In the end I thought of something.
It's such a tremendous relief to find that the abbot is safe.{nl}I have tears in my eyes...
A few decades ago, the thieves attacked the guard camp or stole the supplies in secret.{nl}They were punished for doing so, but I guess they forgot about it.
Everything is crumbling under the cruel flow of time...
My family was able to pass with no problems.{nl}The Royal Army still has trust in you, I don't think you'll get caught.{nl}
I have so much to do already being a guard and caretaker.{nl}Why do I have to do everything myself? Still, I'm glad you're here to help.
Luckily I was off duty that day... I was in the advanced party, you see.{nl}I will pass this on to my relatives.
Just come at me. Show me how you fight with a sword and shield.{nl}Just know that, depending on your skill, I can either teach you or reject you.
This isn't the place for a showdown. {nl}Meet me at the vacant lot under Kapas Highway.
You have some bad habits, but there's room for improvement.{nl}As you know, I'm a demanding teacher, so prepare yourself.
I'm going to go find the second valve in the Central Control Room now.{nl}As long as that is destroyed there's nothing Antares can do.
Finally... I am so relieved that I finally managed to find you!{nl}Please help. Goddess Gabija is in desperate need of your help.{nl}
In the past, the demons have aimed to take the Mage Tower.{nl}Though, we were always able to stop their attacks whenever they attacked.{nl}
But now it's different. Most of the wizards are either dead or have run away.{nl}Only Gabija and a few wizards are still remaining in the tower, protecting it.
Goddess Gabija and the remaining mages are protecting the tower...{nl}But even the goddess will almost be at her limit {nl}since she lost most of her power on Medzio Diena.{nl}
We are gonna lose the tower to the demons if we don't receive help.{nl}Only you can stop all that from happening.
Please, come to the Karsta Hall Site at the Fedimian Suburbs.
This is the entrance to the tower.{nl}I won't be able to use magic, but I will definitely take you to Goddess Gabija.{nl}
Gabija has not disappeared completely.
To protect the tower from the demons, she just had to hide herself.{nl}
Because Agailla Flurry could not find her successor, she managed the tower.{nl}To protect a precious thing... she sacrificed herself.
Are you ready?
Gabija did not disappear on purpose.{nl}She had to protect the tower from the constant demon attacks.{nl}There was no choice for her other than to go.{nl}
Ordinarily, the best way to get accepted as a Pardoner is to contribute a lot of money.{nl}But, I think completing an assignment would be better for you.{nl}
Bring the object called a Fire Jar.{nl}There are rumors saying that the Fedimian Merchants have seen the jar.
Equipment Merchant Yorgis
Item Merchant Muras
Yes! This is it. Talk about a Kepa being the last to know about it's breath.{nl}In any case, I consent to your admittance as a Pardoner.
Psychokinos show their powers by trusting in their abilities.{nl}You should show how much you trust yourself to achieve the perfect Psychokino level.
The Red Vubbe Fighters in this forest will surely be a strong opponent to you.{nl}But you can face them if only you believe in yourself.
If you can't believe in yourself, who are you going to believe when you use your powers?{nl}Right?
Your abilities are already greater than you imagine.{nl}But with my teachings, you can dream of reaching an even higher level.
I've prepared a nice present for my future disciples at Starving Demon's Way.{nl}I think you'll like it.
What the gift could be?{nl}What gift do you think would suit a Necromancer best?
Sure it's impressive, being a Necromancer.{nl}But using our powers on humans is considered taboo.
You know that Pilgrim's Way holds the lessons of Maven right?{nl}To be able to cast a curse on humans as if they originally sinned... Naktis sure is formidable.
This isn't the first time demons have attacked the tower, but it's never lasted for this long. {nl}People on the outside believe Gabija to be missing, is that right?
Thanks to our other allies I'm alright.{nl}I never thought Ironbaum could be destroyed.
This Great Cathedral is an important heritage of the first bishop Maven, {nl}as well as being the sacred location of the revelations.{nl}
But my body refuses to leave this place.{nl}I don't think I can dare to carry out such a sacred mission like this.
So you are now one competent Rodelero.{nl}But, how about fighting a Colimencia... The one at the manor of Greene family.
If you dream to become the greatest Cataphract,{nl}you should be able to defeat Gaigalas at Tenants' Farm without a sweat.{nl}If you understand me, you come back quickly.
You want to advance? Then there's something you should do for me instead of a test.{nl}Please retrieve the lost indulgence money from Aqueduct Bridge Area. You can do it right?
I heard it was lost in the region near Aqueduct Bridge Area, so please find it from Aqueduct Bridge Area.
At the time when I didn't know what to do, the goddesses have sent you.{nl}Anyway, congratulations on your advancement.
So you want to become a Falconer Master.{nl}I don't know which bird you'll end up with, {nl}but the best way to interact with anyone is through food.
Can you go fetch some meat from Beast-type monsters to use as food?{nl}Let's see if you have what it takes to be a Falconer Master.
The stronger the monster is, the more meat you'll get.{nl}Weaker monsters won't give you as much.
It seems like you've completely destroyed the Pot of Silence.{nl}Is there another problem, though?
Soon... Almost there. We can finally be free...
We, Fencers, are faster than anyone and we take the lives of enemies with our accurate attacks.{nl}We may look showy, but behind all that is strenuous and continuous effort.
Being the best in your field is really impressive, huh?{nl}Especially if you're a Psychokino.
For someone like you a battle test should be an easy task by now.{nl}At this point I think it would do you better to learn about {nl}the research carried out by earlier Psychokinos.
There's a tome left by the Psychokinos of the Mage Tower, close to Fedimian.{nl}I think that tome could be of use to you.
The tower is probably crawling with monsters, but I'm sure you can handle it.{nl}Now hurry and go fetch it.
You might... have to look in every single floor.{nl}Psychokinos aren't that easy to classify, you see...
Looking at your expression right now, I think that tome is definitely going to help you.{nl}
Make sure to keep that in mind.{nl}What I'm going to teach you now is just to help make your journey a little bit easier.
You've finally reached the last stage of the Linker.{nl}I recently started on a new study which I think will be useful to you as well.{nl}
What if Linkers could connect not only to people's spirits but their emotions as well...{nl}I think this would allow for a stronger string of mana.{nl}
What do you think?{nl}Think of it as your last task and helping me out with my research.{nl}
Thanks.{nl}Let's see... I'm going to need some kind of trace of a spirit and emotions.{nl}
Get me a Crystal of Twisted Soul from Manahas and {nl}a Shard of Chaotic Emotions from Genar Field.{nl}They'll be excellent objects of study for my research on spirits and emotions.
Looks like I'll be able to finish my research in no time with such a helpful assistant.{nl}This is all for the benefit of Linkers.
So. While we prepare for research, let me teach you about a Linker's strongest type of magic.{nl}It becomes quite difficult since it's the last stage, but I have faith that you can do it.
Thaumaturges, unlike other wizards, focus more on actual battles.{nl}Even if you're trying to learn more magic, which is admirable in itself, {nl}there's only so much I can teach you.
You're doing well.{nl}Go to the 1st floor of the Mage Tower and fight the Salamander.
Sometimes learning from a difficult opponent is important.
Go to the 1st floor of the Mage Tower and defeat the Salamander. {nl}There's something you must learn there. That's how I learned, too.
You're mighty good.{nl}I'm sure you've learned something from this battle.{nl}
Always remember that.{nl}There's magic even stronger than the one I taught you so far, {nl}but even that magic comes down to how you use it.
I wish other people could be as passionate about magic as you are.{nl}But getting into something blindly can do you damage, too.
Yes...{nl}I think what you need is some high-leveled battle experience.{nl}
I heard Escanciu Village hosts a fierce type of monster called Reaverpede.{nl}Defeating it will be a valuable experience for you.{nl}
It is not an easy opponent, so be careful.
Elementalists have to combine different elemental properties.{nl}So, the more diverse your experience is, the better the payoff.
Excellent job.{nl}I feel confident about teaching you other types of magic now.{nl}
To prove yourself, you have to battle.{nl} I hear there's a dangerous monster called Biteregina at Owl Burial Ground.{nl}
You need to able to face danger if you want to become the best Sapper.{nl}What do you say?
The best techniques will give you the best payoff.{nl}I expect great things from you.
Your skills are impressive.{nl}I promise that, if you follow my teachings, you will become an even greater Sapper.
You say you want to become the greatest Hunter?{nl}For someone of your caliber, that is not unthinkable.{nl}
But don't think you're going to do well no matter what.{nl}First you need to do something for me; then I'll teach you a new technique.
As a Hunter you need to be able to face different monsters.{nl}You need to be able to keep your composure in front of any opponent.{nl}
Go and defeat some monsters in Starving Demon's Way, Pilgrim Path, {nl}Altar Way, Forest of Prayer and Apsimesti Crossroads.
Being picky with hunting won't help your experience or your training.{nl}To learn how to keep your cool when faced with any monster, go out and face different types.
So, what do you say?{nl}I'm sure you must have a feeling about this.{nl}
Alright, from now on just do as I say.{nl}I'll teach you the path of a real Hunter.{nl}
How to be a stronger Wugushi?{nl}Help me make poison and I'll teach you a few things.
Thanks.{nl}I want you to catch me some poisonous monsters in this jar.{nl}
It's not that easy to trap them, though.{nl}You have to make sure they're tired enough, then you can put them in the jar.
You can make very potent poison from monster venom, you see.{nl}But bring them alive. If they die, the venom disappears and it won't work.
Shall we learn a new Wugushi technique, then?{nl}I'm going to go straight into it, so pay attention.
You work well, no doubt about that.{nl}Keep learning more advanced techniques and you could become famous.{nl}
This time we're going to test your reconnaissance skills.{nl}All you need to do is scout the place I tell you to. Got it?
Go to the Mage Tower.{nl}I'll let you know the exact location later.{nl}
Survey the area and write a report. Remember each floor has different areas.{nl}Try not to miss anything and record everything you can.
The work of a Scout is synonymous with reconnaissance.{nl}And perfecting your basic skills is the best training you can get.
You came back safely.{nl}I see you're not just agile but you have scounting skills, too.{nl}
Come find me whenever you want to learn a new technique.{nl}And don't forget: perfecting your basic skills is the best training you can get.
The best Thaumaturge... I'm surprised you're already at a level where you can aim for that.{nl}But the domain of the Thaumaturge is very, very wide. It's practically infinite.{nl}
Alright. Enough of this small talk.{nl}Are you ready to show me just how well you can control your magic?
I have a testing site at Laukyme Swamp.{nl}Go there and move the Magic Concentration Orbs to the magic detection area.{nl}
If you lose control of your magic they can end up in another place, so be careful.
I used to train like that all the time when I was younger.{nl}Things became a bit of a mess after Medzio Diena, but it'll be fine.
Impressive.{nl}I knew you could do it.{nl}
Since you completed this test I'm going to pass on to you my last teaching...{nl}How you use and develop it, however, is up to you.{nl}
We create our own limitations.{nl}I can see you feel the same way.{nl}{nl}
Being an Elementalist doesn't mean you can control all the elements.{nl}However, we don't let that become a weakness to us, either.{nl}
Especially for someone like you who's aiming for the top level of Elementalist...{nl}You mustn't let that happen.{nl}Understood?{nl}
One element property we don't often deal with... is darkness.{nl}I wonder if your skills are enough to face this particular element.{nl}
The Netherbovine in Poslinkis Forest is known for the element of darkness.{nl}Go there and defeat it.
For us who believe in the goddesses, working with darkness is taboo.{nl}Although there are those who risk it for the single purpose of defeating the goddesses' enemies.
Your abilities are remarkable.{nl}I'd say you're more than qualified to learn the highest level of the Elementalist.{nl}
Allow me to teach you, then.
I have a task for you. The request came from Wings of Vaivora.{nl}It seems like some baron opened a portal that needs to be closed.{nl}
It was... the Demon Prison.{nl}I wonder what this person was thinking of opening a place full with crawling demons.{nl}
Apparently they sent this request to other places as well, but we can't miss it, can we?{nl}Be the first to complete the task and I'll teach you one of the strongest Wugushi techniques.
Your target is the Rajatoad in Demon Prison District 1.{nl}An easy opponent for a Wugushi, but you can never be too careful in that prison.
Some people have really lost their sense out of fear of disaster.{nl}Orsha is struggling enough as it is. {nl}I don't know if it's a good idea to go there, but I don't want more people to get hurt, either.
Seems like you did a very good job after all.{nl}It was a difficult task, but I have to admit you have skills.{nl}
Alright. Let's get started on the new technique. {nl}I promise to look after you until you become a top Wugushi.
So you came to learn the last technique of the Scouts.{nl}Before that, there's something I want you to do for me.{nl}
It's a favor for the Scout Master...{nl}Apparently the Wings of Vaivora sent us a request but there's no one to carry it out.{nl}
And you're a full-fledged Scout now.{nl}I think this will be a good chance to see what you've learned so far, {nl}and I'm confident you can pull through it...{nl}What do you say?
The mission is to defeat the Deadborn in Demon Prison District 1.{nl}They're very powerful monsters, but for someone of {nl}your level it won't be that difficult of an opponent.
Your expertise in reconnaissance and stealth won't keep you safe forever.{nl}I hope you keep that in mind and take care.{nl}
You fought bravely.{nl}As promised, I'm going to teach you the last technique.{nl}
From the way you completed all my tasks I think you'll have no problems learning it.
The Himil family was at the center of the original Schaffenstar.{nl}Then they left, and when I was born they were no longer an archer family but a warrior family.
We can be misunderstood for dealing with evil forces {nl}or using the power of demons instead of the goddesses.{nl}But using evil forces isn't evil in itself.{nl}We remain within the realm of our magic and the goddesses' blessing.
I came from outside the kingdom.{nl}This place wasn't the only one affected by Medzio Diena, you know.{nl}I came to see what's happening here, but it's taking longer than expected.
The name Saker was given to me by the royal family.{nl}That's how dedicated I am to the kingdom, as I always will be.
I was in the army once.{nl}I couldn't get used to living with so many rules, however, so I quit shortly after.
Plague Doctors don't depend solely on the grace of the goddesses for their healing powers.{nl}We also use human medicine, which means we are able to cure ailments other clerics cannot.
Everything in the world can be expressed in numbers.{nl}Even music. You don't believe it?
Dragoons are exceptionally brave warriors.{nl}No one can stop a Dragoon charging with their spear.
Sometimes simple persuasion isn't just enough and you must do things by force.{nl}This may very well be the case with wizards now.
When you curse someone you must dig your own grave too.{nl}Do you get what that means?
Carrying a heavy cannon around all the time is far from easy.
Not to mention that cannon balls cannot be compared to bullets or arrows.
I'm not just trying to tell you how hard it is for me, though.
Isn't the markmanship of Musketeers just fascinating? With skills like that....{nl}You can fire fast and clear a whole group of enemies or step up and deliver that fatal blow.
After Medzio Diena, Plague Doctors became more important than ever.{nl}That's why I want to mentor future Plague Doctors and help the world.
I know many people think numbers are a pain to work with.{nl}It perplexes me how something so simple and clear can be difficult.
To put it simply, a Chaplain is... a priest that is affiliated with the army.{nl}It is believed that helping the army in accordance to {nl}the will of the goddesses will in turn protect everyone.
Everyone that goes to war desperately wants a sacellum, {nl}so that they may receive blessings from the goddesses.{nl}That is why Chaplains are needed.
So. It seems that you have finally made up your mind about becoming a Chaplain.{nl}A priest like yourself is always welcome.{nl}
Although... There are some formalities left.{nl}To cut straight to the chase, how about helping {nl}the Royal Army stationed here for your assignment?
The more I see, the more I like it.{nl}The Royal Army here at Dvasia Peak is spearheading a road to the Gateway of the Great King.
They are running into a lot of trouble due to the intense hindrance of the monsters.{nl}Wounded soldiers are only the beginning, the amount {nl}of materials stolen by monster is simply staggering.{nl}
Talking about dealing with a few monsters...{nl}It will be a great deal of help to the Royal Army {nl}if you could retrieve some of the materials from them as well.
You will be able to leave a memorable impression on the Royal Army if you help them out.{nl}Of course, it is also good reference to use when recommending you to become a Chaplain.
Excellent.{nl}I have already started to hear praise of your deeds.{nl}
Now, let me tell you what Chaplains are capable of.
(Something seems to be engraved here, but the black fog makes it too dark to see.){nl}
The inner shell of Keparis is perfect.{nl}They last a long time after being polished and engraved. {nl}Would you go and get me some?{nl}{nl}
You were faster than I thought.{nl}Now I can polish this inner shell and make it into a scripture. Thank you.{nl}
String made from Orange Dandel leather is good, but a bit short.{nl}I'm going to give you an anvil for tanning.{nl}Can you make some bookbinding string from the leather string?{nl}
First you need to get some leather string from Orange Dandels.{nl}Then you use this anvil to turn it into some sturdy bookbinding strings.{nl}
(There are engraved images of goddesses, humans and a demon goddess.)
Blacksmith Ilanai
Antanas sent you here, right?{nl}I have to tell you, this was not an easy request...{nl}
Not many would take this order, you know. {nl}Are you engraving a holy spell?
The chisel? Ah. {nl}I couldn't get it exactly the way Antanas wanted so I had someone else take care of it.{nl}
Go see Jura.{nl}She works at the equipment shop.
See you later.{nl}Make sure to come back if you need anything repaired.
Equipment Merchant Jura
The chisel?{nl}Ah, you mean the one Ilanai ordered?{nl}
Jura is in charge of the chisel, not me.{nl}She's the equipment merchant.
Good, this is just how I wanted it.{nl}Now I can get started.
Did you get the chisel?{nl}Special orders are always welcome so feel free to come back.
We're collecting the objects left behind by the Kedora Merchant Alliance during Medzio Diena.{nl}Our leader Merrisa is in charge of the operation.
The District 4 which he ran away to is like a maze. {nl}Kupole Daiva and you would be able to follow him though.
Please show your sympathy....{nl}Hauberk simply does not remember the brutal sins he committed in his past.
Please do not feel sympathy towards Hauberk.{nl}It is sad that his spirit was torn apart, but he too was a demon to be eliminated.{nl}
He is merely incapable of remembering the sins he committed in the past.{nl}It will be a bloody day when he remembers his name...{nl}
I could not tell you the truth as Hauberk was near you.{nl}Please forgive me.
Hauberk is also a sinner. {nl}You don't need to sympathize with him.
Be weary of Hauberk trying to recollect his Soul Fragments.{nl}His Soul Fragments merely do not remember each other...{nl}
It will be a bloody day if when he remembers his name...
This was all because we were so pretentious.{nl}When Laima warned us that trouble was coming...{nl}I was so confident in myself I couldn't understand the meaning of Her words.{nl}
Are you the person they sent here?{nl}Even if it's not you, will you please help our village?{nl}
It wasn't like that on Medzio Diena, but then the bees suddenly started turning into monsters. {nl}Other apiaries are already devastated; I'm worried about what will happen to ours.
You there.{nl}Are you with that group of Revelators that ran away?{nl}
Good.{nl}I only believed the priests but I can't take it any longer.{nl}
So I want to recruit a talented Revelator like you, what do you say?{nl}I'll pay you well.
You came back faster than I thought.{nl}So. Did you have a look?
Are you the Revelator who purified Seal Tower?{nl}Finally... you're here.
These seals exist because of several dimensional cracks spread throughout the world...{nl}If the seal had been broken, the demons would have started an invasion.{nl}
On Medzio Diena I lost most of my power, so I gathered all that was left of it to make a seal...{nl}Alone, however, all I could manage to put together was this measly seal...
Thanks to you, the seal of Uskis Arable Land is now stable.{nl}However, many other Revelators have lost their consciousness {nl}to the evil energy of the seal in Spring Light Woods.{nl}
It looks like the discussion is over.{nl}Let's see what conclusion they came to.
When you first came to see me I wondered if you were worthy of the title of Hoplite...{nl}But here you are now, a full-fledged Hoplite.{nl}
At last it seems it's time for your final test.{nl}I want to see the results of your training so far.
The Apsimesti Crossroads have long been the stage of Hoplites' final test.{nl}Many Hoplites have fought monsters and battled there until their spears broke...{nl}
All their broken spears and armors...{nl}The fruit of those efforts will be the judge of your final qualifications.{nl}
This test won't simply serve to measure your strength.{nl}The level you're trying to reach cannot be achieved that easily.{nl}
To complete it you will also have to experience yourself the {nl}efforts that others have gone through to reach the final level.
Good job.{nl}You'll be a good role model for future aspiring Hoplites.{nl}
I know you're already at the top level, but if there's anything you need, just come see me.
You look a lot more striking than the first time I saw you, my friend.{nl}Alright, let me teach you the last Barbarian techniques.{nl}
I will be frank, I do have my doubts about you on whether you can handle them.
Talk is cheap. What matters is your skill.{nl}This medicine is something we use for training in my hometown... {nl}Actually it's more like a poison.{nl}
Drink it and defeat the monsters down at the Apsimesti Crossroads.{nl}Of course, you'll have to do it on your own.
But you're strong enough, so. You can quit if you want.{nl}If that's all you want to be.
It seems your passion for power is even greater than mine.{nl}I like it. I'm going to teach you everything I know.
Yeah. You're a true Rodelero now.{nl}But to really become stronger you have to learn how to give up your strengths once in a while.
You seem ready.{nl}If so, head to the Apsimesti Crossroads and fight some monsters.{nl}
Sounds easy, right?{nl}How about fighting without your shield then?
A Rodelero's shield is its most reliable ally.{nl}But you cannot be a true warrior if you're not confident in your own strength.
Once again you proved your potential.{nl}Leave the rest to me. I'm going to teach you techniques that'll make your jaw drop.
I thought you'd give up after a while...{nl}But here you are. You must really like Cataphracts, huh?{nl}
You're not so bad yourself.{nl}If you complete the task I'm about to give you, I might just start to like you.{nl}
It's very simple.{nl}All you have to do is go to the Apsimesti Crossroads and defeat some monsters.{nl}
But don't forget, we are Cataphracts.{nl}I'll be really disappointed if you're not straddled on your companion's back at all times.
If you're not familiar with battling on top of your companion, {nl}you might as well give up on being a Cataphract.{nl}Don't tell me you feel dizzy!
Bravo!{nl}I was only half-joking earlier, but I really had no idea whether you could do it.{nl}
Feel free to come see me again.{nl}I think I can put up with teaching you a couple of things.{nl}{nl}
I'm sorry, but there's something I need you to do that's more urgent than your final test.{nl}The Apsimesti Crossroads are being crowded with monsters and people are in danger.{nl}
Use the things you've learned to defeat the monsters.{nl}I should be the one to deal with this but it's an urgent matter, so we'll do this instead of the test.
A broker standing between life and death...{nl}That's how the Bokor Master from Klaipeda described the Bokor.
However, that doesn't apply to humans.{nl}You must always help people according to the will of the goddesses. Remember that.
That was an impressive deed.{nl}I will now teach you everything I know about being a Bokor.
I think it was when I was around your level...{nl}Tesla told me this as his last teaching.{nl}
You can have the best eye for materials and the best techniques...{nl}But without proper maintenance you won't last long as a sculptor.{nl}
Back then I didn't understand what he meant, but now I think I do.{nl}You can make the best statue out of the best materials, {nl}but if your work doesn't last, isn't it worthless?{nl}
That's why maintenance is so important.{nl}I just received an order that would be good for you, would you like to give it a try?
Let's make this your final test, then.{nl}The priests asked for repair work on the statues of Goddess Vakarine in Orsha and Fedimian.{nl}
First go to Bellai Rainforest and collect some greasy Papayam pulp.{nl}I'll use it to make a balm to repair the statues.
Tesla always said that a work of honest care perseveres for hundreds of years.{nl}Hm... I think he was right.
You're back already?{nl}Just wait a moment. I'll make the balm right away.
The balm is finished.{nl}Go to Orsha and Fedimian and use it to repair the statues of Goddess Vakarine.{nl}
Take good care of them, they are statues of the goddess after all.
Tesla used to always tell me this.{nl}The duty of a Dievdirbys is not only to carve the piece, but to look after it with gentle care.{nl}
If you want to become a memorable Dievdirbys, you must never forget this state of mind.{nl}
I was just starting to think it was about time you came to see me.{nl}Alright. If you're ready to show me just how strong your faith is.{nl}
You see, Paladins are fearless because we believe the goddesses will always protect us.{nl}So. Make sure you're ready for this.
This ancient relic is cursed.{nl}It has the power to attract monsters.{nl}
Go to Hyth Cliff in Starving Demon's Way.{nl}Find the Abandoned Altar and use the relic on it.{nl}
I assume you know what happens next.
Right now so much is being tainted by evil forces.{nl}But as long as we believe in the goddesses, nothing can stop the Paladins.
I say you have what it takes to be called a true Paladin now.{nl}Alright. I'm going to teach you what a Paladin is really about.
It seems you're finally starting to feel the limits of your abilities.{nl}Know that in the final level of Rodelero... you can break those limits.{nl}
Whether or not you're able to face that is another question.{nl}The Colimencia in the Greene Manor should help you with that.
I believe that people have no limits.{nl}They simply go through moments of distress.{nl}
I merely offer people a way to overcome them.{nl}So all you need to do is prove that you're ready to face you own distress.
How was fighting such a strong enemy?{nl}I'm sure you realized your own shortcomings.{nl}
But if you chose the path of the Rodelero you must carry it through to the end.{nl}Isn't that what breaking your limits is all about?
If your goal is to become the best Cataphract,  you need to book some results.{nl}Right? I'm talking about defeating an enemy that'll make your name known across the country.{nl}
I'm sure you've heard about the savage Gaigalas of Tenants' Farm.{nl}The number of victims killed by it is countless, they say.{nl}
That should be enough for you.{nl}Go and defeat it.
There's nothing the spear of a true Cataphract can't break through.{nl}Just keep this in mind if you want to become the best there is.
Impressive. The more I see what you can do, the more I like you.{nl}The title of greatest Cataphract is coming for you, that is for sure.
How you carry out your mission is up to you, {nl}but your blessings are the salvation of many others. {nl}Helping others in relieving their agony is a virtue every Sadhu of the goddesses needs.{nl}
However, you must possess the power to put it into practice.{nl}If you want to reach the highest power of the Sadhu, show me that you have it.
Go and face the evil deeds of the monsters that terrorize us.{nl}I hear the Colimencia is causing mayhem at the Greene Manor.
To me there is no real final stage.{nl}I hope you abandon all conceit and keep advancing in your journey.
Other Paladins are already following the footsteps of your heroic acts.{nl}But I want to see for myself just how much you're worth.{nl}
Since this is your final test, it's won't be easy.{nl}Maybe the Gaigalas at Tenants' Farm... Yes, that will suit you as a worthy opponent.
As long as you believe in the goddesses there's nothing to fear.{nl}It's what I've been telling you since the first time you became a Paladin.
I know rumors are always a little exaggerated. {nl}But you, you sure live up to your story.{nl}
I'm sorry I ever doubted you were worthy of the title of Paladin.{nl}
This isn't exactly a level anyone can reach...{nl}I sincerely hope you'll prove that you're worthy of that position.
Where can I find it?
Give me a different task
It's best to face it
That sounds dangerous; I'll pass
That's a bit too much for me
I'll show you
I'm not powerful enough for that yet
There can be no weaknesses
I'll come back after I train a bit more
I'll accept your request
That place is dangerous; I'll pass
Tell me about the request
That sounds dangerous; I'll pass

I'll help the Royal Army

There seems to be something written here but the fog makes it hard to see.{nl}Please collect more crystals that emanate a mysterious light from monsters,{nl}so we have enough light to see.
With all the crystals that emanate a mysterious light combined, the writings became visible!
The last thing I need is another task
I'll go and defeat it right away
That's a little too much for me
I don't think that's necessary

Just as I expected!{nl}I figured you had what it needs to become a good Rune Caster.{nl}
You need to craft your own Rune Stone if you want to become a Rune Caster.{nl}You'll need to gather the required materials to create it.
Since I owe you, I'll give you the most important material, the Blue Demon Stone.{nl}There are quite a few more materials required, so listen up.{nl}
Go to Tyla Monastery and get Malstatue's Evil Energy Fragment.. {nl}You also need to gather Velaphid's Cold Blood and Pumpleflap's Robust Horn as well.
You can gather the rest of the required materials to craft a {nl}Rune Stone from various monsters at Tyla Monastery.{nl}Remember, acquire Malstatue's Evil Energy Fragment, {nl}Velaphid's Cold Blood and Pumpleflap's Robust Horn.
I see you've gathered all of the materials.{nl}Now, let's start with creating a Rune Stone.
This is your Rune Stone.{nl}Now you will be able to use magic of the Rune Caster.
It's a success!{nl}If Hauberk has any thought of doing so, he wouldn't have wasted any time in harming me.{nl}Let's hope he does so.
It may have been thanks to Goddess Austeja, but this region was safe from Medzio Diena.{nl}
But the goddess hasn't come again afterwards...{nl}The monsters are also becoming a nuisance and making everyone feel nervous.
I'm thinking of quiting beekeeping and look for another job because of the monsters.{nl}But the villagers say that this is supposed to be safer than other places... {nl}I can't imagine how it must be elsewhere.
They say that the goddess made a seal at Uskis Arable Land and Spring Light Woods.{nl}The villagers expected an flock of monsters because of the honey... {nl}But I think it is because of the seal.
Cleopas and the villagers...{nl}They keep creating problems with the priests because {nl}the monsters are interrupting the beekeeping.{nl}
I think that we should stand together at a time like this...{nl}Somehow I don't think that'll happen unless Goddess Austeja comes back.
They say that the Owl Sculptures placed around the {nl}forest are there to make sure that souls don't get lost.{nl}Some kind of sculptor supposed to have sculpted them alone...{nl}It's impressive that he managed to make all of them.
There had been some tales of meeting the lost souls...{nl}But lately they are a more common sight. {nl}
The monsters are also attacking more than before.{nl}What in the name of the goddess happened out there...

I have a request for you.{nl}The soldiers are suffering too much from Luvine Rubbas.
Even when the Dico thieves went crazy, I didn't say anything {nl}so I didn't know they would slap me from behind.{nl}The Dico thieves stole our supplies.{nl}
Now, I just hope Sabina stays calm.{nl}We don't want to become like those people due to the Petrifying Frost here.
Many skilled scholars and wizards in the kingdom didn't solve the curse of the Petrifying Frost...{nl}I don't understand what he can do as a Kaliss Knight.
Wait. My head still rings due to the curse. {nl}I have many stories to tell you... I don't know if I will be able to endure until then.
If you show your loyalty to the goddess, {nl}you will be able to receive a blessing from the goddess.{nl}Please understand that each pilgrim has different amounts{nl}of contribution which they can make from each other.{nl}
I realized that the betrayal of my colleagues was due to the curse.{nl}I don't need this anymore... Thank you...
It's not that we don't know the efforts of the priests, but we should protect our village ourselves.{nl}It's hard for us to live on due to the monsters so we can't just stay still.
You got in trouble.{nl}Because of me... I am so sorry.{nl}
Actually, people saying that the Petrifying Frost is {nl}punishment for the revolt is just a made-up story.{nl}It was the curse that came when the revolt was over,{nl}so I understand why humans think like that.{nl}
But, the first one who broke it was the Demon Queen, Gesti.{nl}She brought the curse of the petrification in this region... {nl}and humans died and their spirits turned into stones.{nl}
Of course, the goddesses tried to save the humans!{nl}But, the demons claimed that the humans were not just dead, but they also turned into stones...{nl}
Rather, they... asked us whether we have forgotten not {nl}to interfere with each other's matters... and they... there...{nl}
Wait. This is too scary...{nl}A terrible disaster has come down. {nl}
A disaster so big... that the goddesses had to give up on the salvation of this place.{nl}It was a threat. They warned us that they would bring an even greater disaster...{nl}
Yes. The Petrifying Frost... everything...{nl}That's the cost of giving up on the salvation to block an even greater disaster.
We want to rescue all those spirits even now when the war with the demons has started.{nl}Since you fixed all the detectors, I will lead the spirits to their eternal rest.
Many documents of the Great Cathedral were lost because of the servants of Naktis.{nl}Thinking about it now, that was too much of a loss...{nl}All those were accumulated for hundreds of years...
But, he is also the key to close the dimensional crack.{nl}The reason why I left him like that was because {nl}I wanted him to reserve his strength to be the key.{nl}
I heard Dionys is suffering from slow recovery.{nl}Can you obtain the empty spirits from the demons at Pasaga Isolated Sphere?
I think they are planning to burn the entire forest...{nl}They are just not listening. Can you stop him?
Everything was ruined because of the monsters.{nl}That's why Joseph looked for the Revelators after going to Klaipeda.{nl}
Because of the evil energy, I can't do the farming. Those monsters are really...{nl}I've been farming here for a long time, but after that girl came here, we faced terrible things.{nl}
Do you know the place called the Astral Tower?{nl}All the famous archers in the history are from this place starting from Lydia Schaffen.{nl}
Start searching
Something strange seems to be happening.{nl}Frozen soldiers and a Necromancer...{nl}Should we collect some information at the post of the soldiers?
Finished searching
Boards with blood...{nl}When we put together the situation so far, it seems a massacre has occurred here.
Sound of a scream
You've heard the sound of scream!
Necromancer Adomas
Help... To Lemija...{nl}I should tell Lemija to be careful about Faustas...{nl}
We should run away quickly... my... bag... memo... to Lemija...
Please hurry, before it's too late. We should somehow stop Faustas.
I am Lemija... Who are you?{nl}
This... memo? Are you giving it to me?{nl}Sure, I will read it...
Did Adomas just ask you to beware of Faustas?{nl}That doesn't make sense. He is our colleague...{nl}
Then wait. {nl}Adomas... Where is he?{nl}
What? Adomas... Is that really true?{nl}And those frozen soldiers chasing you... what are you talking about?{nl}
Even if you say it like that, it's hard for me to believe.{nl}But, this memo... I can tell it is written by Adomas...
I gotta go see it and check.{nl}If you are okay, can you take me to Adomas?
Nothing is here?{nl}Ah, I am sure Adomas wouldn't have done it.{nl}
Are you joking with me?{nl}I don't know how you know Adomas and Faustas... but you are really rude.{nl}
Alright. I am done. {nl}I have to meet with two other people.
Faustas broke the taboo and experimented with the dead bodies of humans!{nl}The frozen soldiers that you've seen so far is all because of him...{nl}
While I was trying to stop Faustas...{nl}He told me that he would send me to Adomas...{nl}
I am so sorry. I should've trusted you.{nl}I am sure that Adomas... I don't know why Faustas is doing this.
Actually, Faustas came to Vedas Plateau because of the Necromancer Master's instructions.{nl}The families of the soldiers who worked here asked us to handle the corpses.{nl}
But, then we lost contact after that...{nl}The master who was worried sent me and Adomas here.{nl}
But, then... how come such tragedy...{nl}He is not someone who would do something like this.{nl}
I am sure that there is a story behind all of this...{nl}We need to avoid breaking the taboo.
We don't have enough time to request help from the master.{nl}And even when they are the same as us, Faustas is especially skilled...{nl}
I am sorry, but... Can you help us stopping Faustas?{nl}I am begging you, please.
He just didn't break the taboo. How could he do that to Adomas...{nl}What's wrong with him...
This is enough!{nl}Hold on. I will make you a talisman.
It is completed. Use this talisman on a frozen soldier. {nl}It will absorb the magical power of Faustas that is embodied in them.
I will prepare the magic to break the barrier. {nl}Please collect his magical power to the talisman.
It is very strong and dark magic...{nl}I think this will be enough, but is this really the magical power of Faustas?{nl}
This is strange.{nl}It seems that the magical power became stronger than what I knew before.{nl}
The magic to break the barrier is ready.{nl}Hurry. Follow the road at the bottom and go to Minkatos Forkroad from the post.
Here. From now on, I will break the barrier with his magical power. {nl}Please move away for a bit.
Hey... you...{nl}Have you ever lost someone you love in front of your eyes?{nl}
Those soldiers... the ones who are more cruel than the demons...{nl}They've taken my Elluma away...{nl}
Even if I continue to kill them! {nl}I just... I just cannot forgive them... and I couldn't protect her... {nl}
It was so miserable... As I had to follow her to the goddesses...{nl}Demons with scars on their faces came close...{nl}
Yes.. The Kruvina that he handed over... would save her... {nl}If I could find her back, the taboo is...{nl}
But, look at me...{nl}Even when I devoted my life to that greedy Kruvina...{nl}I wasn't able to find her... I... can't meet her anymore...{nl}
Elluma... Is she going to forgive me?{nl}I am sorry. Lemija... I will apologize to Adomas if I can meet him...{nl}
That is... for sure...
Faustas...
I am sorry... Please give me some time to think about it...
No matter what the reason, the sins Faustas has committed can't be forgiven.{nl}He broke the taboo, experimented with humans and he even killed Adomas...{nl}
But... Everything was done to save his loved one...{nl}Anyway, I will tell the master about Faustas.{nl}
But, to the bereaved families...{nl}I hesitate to tell them that the soldiers have done such a thing...
Thank you so much for helping me so far.{nl}Alright then... I will do my work now.
His power... is strange. {nl}An evil energy... I don't feel so good.{nl}
Let's go. It is more important to stop Faustas than me.{nl}There has to be some reason behind it...
It seems that Adomas passed away.
As I was looking for Faustas, I found the barrier that he created.{nl}I was trying to break the barrier, but soon I failed because the magical power was too strong.{nl}
It is little uncomfortable, but nothing other can be done in order to reduce the gap from him.{nl}The frozen soldier who you saw... {nl}We just have to steal his magical power that is embodied in the soldier.{nl}
But, instead of me, we need the medium to hold the magical power.{nl}Since I was attacked by Faustas, his magical power is a big burden to me.{nl}
Could you collect the pieces of the corpses from the monsters nearby? {nl}I will create the talisman that will be used as a medium with those pieces.
Old Letter
To my missing grandfather.{nl}-{nl}Hello, grandfather. How are you? {nl}I am guarding at Vedas Plateau and I lifted my pen as I remember you.{nl}I am doing this because I miss you so I hope you don't scold me!{nl}How's the village? 
When I heard about the demons that were locked in the underground mine from you, it was too scary..{nl}Ronesa wept after listening about it with me.{nl}I feel everything precious which I felt normal in the past.{nl}I will write you another letter next time. I hope you are well until then.{nl}-{nl}- Your grandson, Hendrick -
Memo left by the Commander
I am the commander of the Vedas Plateau headquarter.{nl}I am leaving this in hope that someone will understand this.{nl}My subordinates have completely changed.{nl}They started to suffer from the coldness and hunger so they abandoned their pride and started to steal nearby places like the bandits.
It's been a long time that they didn't follow my orders.{nl}Even so, I couldn't stop them from living on.{nl}My condition is getting worse.{nl}Even if I lose to my disease, I won't be like them.{nl}I will lock myself into the hideout.
Hidden Commander
Who are you...?{nl}
So you've come after reading my memo...{nl}I guess my last wish reached the goddesses...
I am so glad that I met you...{nl}I don't have enough time...{nl}
I have a favor to ask you...{nl}There is a woman who is waiting for me... although... I am dying...{nl}
On behalf of me... Please hand over this wedding ring to her...{nl}I don't think I can keep the promise we made... I am sorry...
Do you have any business with me?{nl}
...This ring... so it happened like that...{nl}Yes... he...{nl}
Thank you so much for handing this over to me...{nl}If you don't mind, I want to be alone for now...
Thank you... Her name is Retia...{nl}She must be working at Verkti Square...{nl}
Now, I will be able to go beside the goddesses...{nl}Thank you... so much... my friend....
Have you collected the relics of the soldiers?{nl}Thank you so much. I will pass these to the remaining families.
Thank you for telling me the last news about him...
The 13th of X{nl}-{nl}Elluma... Elluma died...{nl}While I left my seat, the soldiers started to attack her.{nl}As I gained my consciousness, I found out that I killed the soldiers with my own hands.{nl}
I'm feeling empty...{nl}This mission doesn't matter to me... I didn't even protect my beloved one...{nl}Maybe I should've followed Elluma as well...{nl}{nl}
The 14th of X{nl}-{nl}The demon with black clothes appeared in front of my eyes.{nl}I had nothing to fear since I've already made up my mind that I would follow Elluma.{nl}The demon grinned at me and asked me if I wanted to save Elluma.{nl}
He was holding a red stone piece called the Kruvina,{nl}Since this place is full of snow, the corpses don't rust... that power may save Elluma.{nl}{nl}
The 18th of X{nl}-{nl}As I used the Kruvina, the magical power that I possess amplified.{nl}The problem is that as the Kruvina continuously attempts to get my life force, {nl}it continuously consumes my life force.{nl}I guess I should handle the Kruvina more cautiously.
The Xth of X{nl}-{nl}I can feel that the Kruvina is slowly encroaching my body.{nl}It's like a glass that has its bottom broken, even when I am not using the Kruvina, I can feel my life force flowing.{nl}But, I can't stop now.{nl}I've already broken the taboo and experimented with humans.
The 11th of X{nl}-{nl}Starting from tomorrow, Faustas will be dispatched to Vedas Plateau.{nl}Due to the instructions of the Necromancer Master. {nl}He received a request to clear the corpses of the soldiers.{nl}
I said I will follow because I thought the mountain covered {nl}with snow would be helpful to both me and Faustas.{nl}Faustas was surprised, but it seemed he didn't like it.{nl}I should get prepared soon.{nl}{nl}
The 12th of X{nl}-{nl}I've arrived at Vedas Plateau without any problems.{nl}I had worried that I would only encounter the corpses of the soldiers, but I felt better as I saw a few survivors.{nl}The soldiers are strong as I expected.{nl}
As the Necromancer Master instructed, Faustas started to collect the corpses.{nl}I should think about what I can do for the living soldiers.

The abbot is locked in a monastery filled with monsters, but Ebonypawn...{nl}There's a limit to how someone acts. Don't you agree?
It wasn't just the bees that changed.{nl}These monsters I had never seen in my life started to come over to Siauliai Woods.
I know this doesn't concern you on a personal level.{nl}But whatever the reason, as a cleric I cannot help the work of the demons.
Really? Thank you!{nl}All you need to do is plant these seeds at the Radanza Farm. Thank you once again!
On top of that, the abbot is locked inside the monastery.{nl}One thing is after we reclaimed the monastery, {nl}but before then please don't mention the expulsion.
Let's make this your final test, then.{nl}The priests have asked to repair the statue of Goddes Ausrine in Orsha {nl}and the statue of Goddess Vakarine in Fedimian.{nl}
The balm is finished.{nl}Take it and repair the Goddess Statues in Orsha and Fedimian.{nl}
I've prepared some magic to break the barrier. Go now.{nl}Follow the road south to the Soldier's Camp, the head to the Minkatos Forkroad.
Burning Stones [Fletcher Advancement]
You've received the balm. Use it to repair the statue of Goddes Ausrine in Orsha and the statue of Goddess Vakarine in Fedimian.
Thank you. I hope I'm not giving you needless trouble all because of me.
Although I don't know you, I am glad to see you.{nl}It's good to be acquainted with someone here. Everyone should help each other out.{nl}
If you could bring me the nucleus of the detector, I will do the rest.{nl}You've contributed a lot to this experiment so I will give you the effects of the Symbol of Silt.{nl}Although it woud not last long...
I didn't expect that the true intent of the curse cast on this forest is after the Great Cathedral.{nl}Fortunately, we were able to stop the curse due to one Revelator, but I feel ashamed.
So nothing occurs as I expected.{nl}If that's the case... We can't say we are in distress. We just have to rely on the one{nl}that we demons want to eliminate.
Oh, I heard from Titas but I didn't think that's you. I feel reassured. {nl}Well then, please support the monster extermination mission.
This thing on my side is devised to read the memory of the spirits.{nl}I made it myself. I have done this before.{nl}
No remorse for revolting.{nl}This Restraint Token will calm them down.
By the way, Blut seems to be proud of what happened to Hauberk because of him. {nl}He was in a group that targeted the strongest and Hauberk was at the top of their list. {nl}
I need proof to show to Vakarine we've been fighting here.{nl}Can you collect demon teeth in Hradeti Crossroads?
Dead of the dead... what could that mean?{nl}Do you have any idea?
But you have to pay for damaging public facilities. {nl}Sorry but you have to fix the wooden seal.
I'm getting too old for this..
Merchant Dolonas
That coward is sure taking too much time.
Tomalov
Preparation is killing me.{nl}I hope the Kedora Merchant Alliance can stay in Manahas a bit longer.
The Kedora Merchant Alliance is currently recruiting new comers in Manahas.{nl}Entry test is to bring slimy wings to them.{nl}There are two options, one is to go back to Fedimian and buy them. The other is defeating the monsters and acquire them myself. But Fedimian is too far away and the monsters in this area are far too tough for me.
{nl}If it is not too much of a problem, could you help me with this?{nl}You can get slimy wings from defeating Kepari Shamans and Orange Dandels.{nl}If I get in the Kedora Merchant Alliance, I will surely repay you.{nl}
I am not entirely certain whether the Kedora Merchant Alliance will stay in Manahas while I go back to Fedimian and get back.{nl}They wouldn't even tell me where they are headed next.{nl}Even if I do manage to follow them, they might ask for something different.
Could you get some more?{nl}I don't think these will be sufficient.{nl}But thank you so much for all your trouble.
We will need a lot of solvent in order to make the reagent that removes Naktis' curse.{nl}But, as you can see, we can't get the solvent at the moment.
The girl left this tree before Medzio Diena.{nl}My master asked me to find out more about the tree, but I know nothing about it... I want to get help from you.
{nl}First, go down to the well and fill this bowl on that well.
I am working here by order, but this place feels bad.{nl}A long time ago, the son of my master disappeared in the underground tunnels. That alone is somewhat frightening.{nl}
It is completed. Use this talisman on a frozen soldier. {nl}It will absorb the magical power of Faustas that is embodied in them.
I'll help you, but I still don't believe you.

As your competence increases, people won't know who made these traps.{nl}On the contrary, people may find out who made these traps so easily.{nl}
Our comrades who were attacked by Petrifying Frost... they are just left there without avoiding the rain and the wind.{nl}On top of that, we have a limited support... We have no choice, but to wait.{nl}
The grave robbers are going all out here.{nl}We have to wait for extra support from headquarters.
I want to talk to Laius again.{nl}But, I guess I should wait until he comes to me...
The level of the strongest Hunter... I am not sure if you could follow well.{nl}I will give you an assignment. Hunt for various types of monsters.
Well done.{nl}However, this jewel is just an empty shell.{nl}You can complete it by empowering it with various materials.
I am sure there is magical power left.{nl}I have nothing else but to hope it still exists.
So nothing occurs as I expected.{nl}If that's the case... We can't say we are in distress. We just have to rely on the one{nl}that we demons want to eliminate.
Ah, is this the first time you've seen our merchants?{nl}I fully understand. It's because we've only done our business in secret.{nl}
I think...{nl}What if he wanted to escape without going through the dimensional crack you came here with...{nl}You should look for the crack which has been weakened due to the collapse.{nl}
If you resist, we would have to execute the kingdom order.
We had no other choice but to run away.{nl}The problem was the abbot. He was praying in the Prayer Room.{nl}
It is little uncomfortable, but nothing other can be done in order to reduce the gap from him.{nl}The frozen soldier who you saw... {nl}We just have to steal his magical power that is embodied in the soldier.{nl}
There are many strange things that can't be seen in forests other than Kateen Forest.{nl}Such as the wooden owl sculptures.w
I support the Hunters, but I don't know what the other senior monks are thinking.{nl}However, I don't think it would be a problem if we get hard evidence.
For example, help cleaning the monsters at our workplace.{nl}The gathering place. What do you think? Can you help us?
Whose side are you on?{nl}The Royal Army or the Knights of Kaliss?{nl}If you don't want to answer, then just do what you are told.
Is this... a love letter? {nl}I don't need it so you can take it or throw it away.{nl}
A scroll?{nl}I thought she'd give us something like a ballista or a magicial weapon...{nl}
But as they hide more and more, more people will be curious about Ruklys.{nl}The gallows could be near, but how could a scholar just do nothing?
The soldiers doing their missions here all worked here for a long time.{nl}They experienced lots of things such as Petrifying Frost or monsters so they are somewhat insensitive now.
Please do not read the old records or take out the artifacts to outside.{nl}Even we can't forgive you if you do so.
Poison is a double-edged sword. So you must take caution when handling it.{nl}If a drop of it enters your system through a scratch...
Fight me and win.
This battle was a shameful one as a commander. {nl}I don't know what would have happened if it wasn't for you..
Wait. My head still rings due to the curse. {nl}I have many stories to tell you... I don't know if I will be able to endure until then.
Show your determination to defeat enemies for the goddesses.{nl}Sacrifice their vicious beings to the sanctum as proof of your belief.
The only thing I could tell to the villagers who were wounded was to wait..{nl}Even if it was the monsters' doing. Reality is cruel.
Not bad. Not bad at all.{nl}Welcome to Doppelsoeldner!
Whew, this is really endless. {nl}I don't know how much longer I can take it.
What a rare meat delicacy. Must have been hard to obtain it.{nl}Be a good Falconer.{nl}
Vincentas
I don't know who you are but...{nl}Assassub Ebonypawn is lurking around.
{nl}As you can see, all my best soldiers...{nl}It didn't spare me neither...
{nl}It's far too dangerous for you as well. Run!{nl}
{nl}You are the Revelator. The Revelator who made the name in the Western part of the Kingdom?{nl}If you are the Revelator, perhaps you can face Ebonypawn.
{nl}Could I ask you to help me?{nl}In order to face Ebonypawn, there are some items we need...
{nl}We need them quick.{nl}They will be among the supplies we have lost during the escape.
This old life perhaps be useful for the Kindom...{nl}
Nevermind that..{nl}It was a mere rambling of an old man.
Have you retrieve them?{nl}Let's see...{nl}
Oh thank heavens, they are in good shape.{nl}I will look for something that might be of some use for you.
Yes, yes. Take this military bomb and antidoe with you.{nl}
Ebonypawn is hiding somewhere here.{nl}Watch out for the traps set by Ebonypawn.{nl}
Our squad fell into those traps...{nl}So please be careful.
{nl}Get you to the armory and on your way there, search for that coward.
We weren't taking the assault lying down. We did manage to hurt Ebonypawn.{nl}Not certain on the severity though.{nl}
The state of his wounds will keep him away from attacking the Revelator hastily.{nl}Even so, best to not let our guard down.
Sorry for being so useless. If I weren't injured...
These are from my men.{nl}At least, their keepsakes have been retrieved.
{nl}To be perfectly honest, I had my doubts about you.{nl}But after seeing what you have done for me... I have something to tell you.
{nl}I am Vincentas of the Royal Bodyguards.{nl}My duty is to protect the Royal family from threats ever since Medzio Diena.
{nl}I was on a mission to escort them to safety.{nl}The surviving members of the royalty is working towards rebuilding the Kingdom and the preparation is almost complete.
{nl}The Chancellor was on the way to seek co-operation from Southern cities. It was then when Ebonypawn struck.{nl}Sent by those who want to eliminate the royal family.
{nl}To rebuild the kingdom, Ebonypawn must be eliminated.{nl}At my current state, all I could do is ask for your help.{nl}I am so ashamed.
The battle we have had caused great harm to both sides.{nl}Ebonypawn at his most weakest is our best chance to strike.
{nl}The training field that we have not yet searched, he must be there.{nl}Punish Ebonypawn.
I want to join the fight...but I will only drag you down.{nl}However, I will patch myself up and join you right away just in case.{nl}
At my current state, getting there would be a challenge. So, if possible, could you sweep up some of the monsters on your way to the inner training ground.{nl}I will join you as soon as possible.
I am beginning to think that Goddess has not foresake the Kingdom.{nl}She has brought you here, after all.
So, Ebonypawn has finally fallen.{nl}
You exceed your own reputation.{nl}
I am not ready to fight yet but i can move.{nl}I have to inform the royalty.{nl}
I will tell them of your triumph.{nl}Let us meet again in the future.
A new Miko is always welcome.{nl}Just following Kanuushi's orders are busy enough.
We have to find Divine Spirits, maintain the barrier that suppresses the Tree.{nl}If you desire to join us, you wouldn't mind helping us, right?{nl} 
I have set some barriers thoroughout the kingdom.{nl}They suppress the Tree from getting larger.{nl}
Could you check up on those barriers for me?{nl}Completing this errand would prove whether you are up for more difficult tasks of a Miko.
Since you are not a proper Miko yet, you won't be able to perceive barriers.{nl}Take this gohei with you.{nl}Wave it in front of a barrier and it will reveal itself to you.{nl}
Nevellet Quarry 1F, Royal Mausoleum Workers Lodge,    Sicarius 1F.{nl}Also, there are one each in Residence of the Fallen Legwyn Family, 2nd Demon Prison and Roxona Reconstruction Agency West Building.
I want you to know that I am not giving you this workload not because I don't want to do it myself.{nl}You understand, right?
There were days where we would just sit in our rooms, sipping tea all day...{nl}Alas, those days are gone.
Have you check them all?{nl}Nothing unusual right?{nl}
The barriers that I personally set up cannot be broken easily.{nl}Anyway, good work.{nl}
You can be a good Miko like me.{nl}My eyes never deceive me. I can see that in your future.{nl}
Then I could have some time to breathe...
Be careful with this. It turns your bodily fluid acidic.{nl}Throw it at monsters and retrieve their bodily fluids.
It would be easier to lure one from the sky than to try finding one without using a food box.{nl}Alternatively, you could just go to Viltis Forest.
To make the scripture, sheets are important, but binding is also important.{nl}Especially, the strings. It will be no good if the scripture gets untied.{nl}
There are so many soldiers here than we expected.{nl}Be careful.. Don't get spotted. Let's meet inside.
Have you ever seen the Great Cathedral or the Mage Tower before?{nl}How about a gigantic goddess statue like the one in Fedimian.{nl}
Is there anything else you want to ask?
The kingdom fought hard against Medzio Diena.{nl}Two of the four heroes are from the royal family.
{nl}The kingdom must stand proud and tall for the world to stand straight. That makes assassins like Ebonypawn the number one target to be taken of with extreme prejudice.{nl}Godspeed.
Hmm, even if it's not the Church's order, shouldn't the Great Cathedral be restored first... {nl}Wouldn't we be able to find the answer to the curse more easily then?
I don't know if we will be able to find a way to release the curse if things continue like this.{nl}If I only had the power, I would have driven all demons out from the Great Cathedral.
The current state of absent goddesses, we had to take matters into our own hands.
{nl}With greater authority comes greater responsibility.{nl}Despite the increased burden on our shoulders, we had to live and fulfill the duties of an inquisitor and a cleric.
After Medzio Diena, our authority grews and so did our responsibility.{nl}We had no manpower to train new inquistors until now. 
{nl}It is a shame that those so-called believers with different faith are growing in numbers and their activities growing rampant.{nl}That is why we must strengthen our base by accepting voluteers to our noble profession. Inquisitors.
In the past, she told us that she couldn't just not do anything, even if her power was weakened.{nl}We barely managed to persuade her.{nl} 
Your lead was a big help. {nl}I wonder if this is all the guidance of the goddess..
The demons that are spreading the vicious curses are still roaming the Great Cathedral.{nl}As a priest under the goddesses' name, how can I just leave this be.
We are going to reclaim the camp and try our best not to be conquered again. {nl}By doing so, we would be able to protect ourselves from monsters and intruders like you.{nl}
Whether it's to restore the weakened seal or to cure the addled Revelators, {nl}We will need that symbol.
I know that purification is important,{nl}but if we don't save those poisoned farmers right away, they may lose their lives.{nl}As a druid, how can I leave those people behind?
I will believe my master even though he has made a wrong choice.
The tales of valor about you as a paladin haven been well heard and inspired so many other paladins.{nl}But I want to see your prowess with my own eyes.{nl}
All the heathen activities are a bit too much to handle on our own...
Thank you for helping us.{nl}I should visit the site to see what they were planning.
An archer does not just shoot from far behind.{nl}A hackapell charges towards the battleground with trusty comrades. Straight in.{nl}
And our combat style is not tied to a bow and arrows.{nl}We can wield a pistol, a dagger, a sword, a shield and other various weapons to bring the most efficient outcome in combat.
Many other archers lack flexible mind.{nl}There are some limitations when you only train yourself with one type of weapon.{nl}
Our bowsmanship is more advanced form.{nl}The combat style that can adapt to different combat situations.{nl}
That is the bowsmanship of a Mergen.
A shield is not a cowardly tool.{nl}The real cowards are those who only use their shields to hide behind it.{nl}
We equip light and get as close to your enemy as possible.{nl}Strength is the most effective way to strike down upon your foes.{nl}
How can you claim yourself to be a gladiator if you are afraid of combat?
Our ways of spears exist for the kingdom.{nl}Tender one's spear and fend off the enemies of the kingdom.
Charging towards the battlefield faster than anyone else. Crushing our enemies and protecting our kins.{nl}That is the path of a lancer.

The cure for the Nobreer epidemic is finally complete.{nl}The patients' condition is slowly improving, too.
I refuse to accept there was ever any truth to the words of Ruklys, the traitor.{nl}As a servant of the Royal Army, my beliefs are with the Kingdom entirely.
If we knew the inside of the Fortress of the Land, we could have disguised some members of the Knight of Kaliss as tomb raiders and gotten in...
Sometimes your armor breaks and you gotta fight with your bare body.{nl}The feeling you get when you still manage to hurt the enemy like that... You gotta live it to know it.
What, you don't believe me?{nl}Guess you're still a little unexperienced...
Amanda is going to carve something on the tombstone.{nl}What could she be thinking of writing?
We've decided to have a few Knights of Kaliss infiltrate the location undercover.{nl}Paying Amanda costs a fortune.{nl}
However I don't want them to risk their lives in vain.{nl}I'm sorry to ask, but since you've been inside the fortress, I would like you to give us an idea of what we should be careful of.
Please write down anything we should mind inside the Fortress of the Land on these notes.{nl}Feel free to be very specific.
I pondered deeply before deciding to have the Knights of Kaliss enter the fortress.
{nl}In the end, money was the biggest aspect to factor in my decision.
This should be enough.{nl}I'll select a few talented knights to enter the fortress.
If you helped the Amanda Grave Robbers, guess I gotta believe you.
I received orders from Amanda to join the Dico Tomb Thieves and get anything that could be useful to the Knights of Kaliss.{nl}Unfortunately I can't deliver the stuff myself so I was gonna ask a few of Amanda's people.
The thing is they're still not here, so I'm worried the Dicos are gonna find out about me.{nl}Would you go to the Inner Enceinte District for me and deliver the things to a person called Wilhelmina Carriot?
Amanda did say she would get one of her subordinates in the Dico Tomb Thieves; I assume that's you.{nl}Let me see what you brought.
Making business with the Amanda Grave Robbers was definitely a good decision.{nl}Thank you for your help.
Did you really do it?{nl}I mean, the monsters around here are kinda weak, so, you know.
{nl}You need to fight a monster that's stronger than you.{nl}Without depending on your armor, that is.
Don't push yourself too much, though, get some training first.
Wow... You really did it, huh.{nl}Impressive.{nl}
You look a bit tired, though.
Ah... Thanks to you I did find a proper stone, but I don't have the tools to carve it.
Stone carving tools?{nl}Yes, I have them right here.
{nl}You're always welcome to ask for anything you need.
Yeah, this should do it.{nl}Hold on.
I'm gonna go carve it now.
I carved out our achievements on it.{nl}I want our successors to remember them.
Thank you for finding the textbook.{nl}I know it wasn't your intent coming here, but you were a great help.

To go to the Great Cathedral mentioned in the Mage Tower Revelation, you must pass through Pilgrim's Way, which connects to Fedimian. Move to Starving Demon's Way.
Wilhelmina Carriot seems to have made a decision. Talk to her.
Report on the Environment Inside the Fortress of the Land
The Knights of Kaliss plan to infiltrate the Fortress of the Land without the knowledge of the Royal Army. Use the writing tools provided by Wilhelmina Carriot to note down any aspects they will need to be careful of when entering and navigating the inside of the fortress.

What a rare meat delicacy. Must have been hard to obtain it.{nl}Be a good Falconer.{nl}
I realize you are a Revelator, but please understand I cannot cooperate with the demons in any way.
Here, take it.{nl}It looks like your faith in the goddesses is very strong.
The seal of Demon Lord Baiga...{nl}Now that's scary.
{nl}Out of the three demon lords under Giltine, Baiga is the most terrifying.{nl}He's extremely cold and distant, but most of all cruel.
I imagine Dawn Maidens must have the same power of curse as Naktis, seeing as they are so similar in appearance.
If there was a way to find out, it would be extremely useful for my research on curses.
Think your companion is the best?{nl}Let's see you prove it, then.
What, you didn't expect me to just believe you, did you?
What's wrong...?
{nl}It seems you have something to ask.{nl}I'll be glad to help you if I can.{nl}
Hm... I've never seen this script either.
It's probably best if you ask someone with more knowledge.{nl}Someone like the Sage Master.
Let's go see the Sage Master.
So you found some writings engraved in a tombstone at Fasika Plateau and you brought a rubbed copy.{nl}Alright, let me have a look.
I'm not sure what script this is, but it isn't human.
My word...
This is demon language.{nl}It's ordering someone to put a curse on Fasika Plateau, it seems.{nl}I worry these orders may already have been put into practice.
{nl}That is what it's written, although curses aren't really my forte.{nl}Maybe the Bokor Master will know how to handle this curse.
I should go see the Bokor Master, she's the expert on curses.
The demons are planning to curse Fasika Plateau, you say?{nl}I see, I need to find a way to stop them from placing this curse.
To curse an area as wide as Fasika Plateau, the demons would need to plant a few cursed objects throughout.{nl}They could very well have done this already.
{nl}It's hard to tell what the cursed objects might be with the naked eye.{nl}You'll need to take the curse detecting orb I'm going to give you.{nl}The orb detects the energy of the cursed objects and will guide you towards them.
{nl}The Curse Detector, however, cannot distinguish between different types of curses.{nl}Besides, Fasika Plateau is a rather large area.
You're right.{nl}Regardless of the setbacks, the important thing is to find the cursed objects and stop the demons.{nl}Here, have the Curse Detector.
{nl}Use the Curse Detector to find the cursed objects and bring them to me so I can destroy them.
There's no time to waste.{nl}We must stop Fasika Plateau from becoming a cursed land.
The energy coming from this broken piece of mirror...{nl}It's a curse of dissidence and conflict.
{nl}I'll take care of the pieces of mirror.{nl}We may have stopped the curse, but this won't keep the demons from trying again...
{nl}Thank you.
That's... a ledger from the Kedora Merchant Alliance. And it's written in secret ink.{nl}Are you saying you found this at Genar Field?
{nl}Let's see...
{nl}First, I'm going to need the rest of the ledger.{nl}If that's okay, would you go back to Genar Field and find it for me?
{nl}I'm afraid I have to stay and collect some things for the Alliance...
Thank you.{nl}I'll give you a detector to find the rest of the ledger written in secret ink.
Use the detector and it will lead you to the rest of the ledger.{nl}Go to where it points you and collect the remaining parts.
I hope no part of the ledger has been damaged.
You found the rest of the ledger. Thank you.{nl}You just took a lot of work out of our hands.
It's going to be a while until I get more supplies, but I'm already out of Holy Powder.{nl}I can't go to Klaipeda myself, though, it would make me worry for the soldiers.
Would you?{nl}Take my letter, then.
{nl}As the Chaplain Master, I could never make you buy materials for me with your own money.{nl}Thake this letter to the Priest Master and he will give you the Holy Powder.
Supplies are delayed, I see.{nl}Just a moment.
The Priest Master is getting some Holy Powder.
Here you go.{nl}You can deliver this to the Chaplain Master.
What great relief you brought me.{nl}This should last me for a good while.
You were cursed by a Dawn Maiden?{nl}Oh no, are you all right?
That's a relief.{nl}There's no doubt the goddesses are looking over you.
{nl}Dawn Maiden curses aren't as strong as the ones cast by Nakis, but they seem based on the same principles.{nl}If only I could research their essence.
Are you sure?{nl}But you were just cursed by a Dawn Maiden...
{nl}Well, if you really are determined to find a way to break Naktis' curse...{nl}Just make sure you're careful.
Come back if you feel it's too dangerous.
So this is the essence.
I'll start studying it immediately, hopefully soon I can find a way to break Naktis' curse.
You're here again. 
{nl}Although, you do look a litte... hurt.
{nl}Did something happen?
You're looking for a way to soothe the Rabees and Honeybeans?{nl}Well, regular bees usually like the scent of Beaj flowers.
Rabees and Honeybeans are a little different, though.{nl}To soothe them, we will need to combine Beaj flowers and scented herbs to create a candle with the power of Goddess Austeja.
You can easily find the Beaj flowers and scented herbs at Uskis Arable Land.
I'll combine the flowers and the herbs and use the power of Goddess Asteja now to create the candle.{nl}It won't take long, just wait a moment.
Priest Raeli is making the candle.
The candle is complete.{nl}You only need to place it where the Rabees and Honeybeans live.
Honeybeans and Rabees live mostly in Dina Bee Farm...{nl}Just place the candle in any area where you see them.
The effects won't be immediate.{nl}But the scent of the candle will help them calm down eventually, so don't worry too much.
Alright, if you really think your companion is so great, let's put it to the test.
{nl}True companions stay loyal and fight together.{nl}When you're fighting a monster and your companion helps you win, that's when you really see what they're made of.
{nl}I'll agree with you if you can defeat a monster stronger than you with your companion.
It's okay to give up, though.{nl}Don't let your companion get beat up just to prove something.
Not too shabby, huh?{nl}Alright, you can brag all you want about your companion.{nl}I'll agree.
That spirit again...{nl}I even sang them their favorite song, I don't know what happened.
{nl}Escanciu Village is nice and far, too.{nl}Maybe I should check the trumpet...
Do you mean it? That would be great.{nl}The divine spirit in Escanciu Village loves the sound of this trumpet.
This is the score for the spirit's favorite song.{nl}Play this to the divine spirit, I'm sure they'll love it.
Just make sure to hit the notes right, the divine spirit of Escanciu Village is very sensitive.
I knew the Divine Spirit was gonna love that song.
Are you saying there's an evil spirit in the Mokusul Chamber?{nl}Very well, I will find it and banish it.
If you say so, alright. Thank you.{nl}I will tell you how to drive the spirit away.
{nl}Use my evil spirit detector to find it, then trap it with the draining orb.{nl}You should make sure to trap the evil spirit as soon as you find it, or else it may escape.
And don't let your guard down after you find the spirit.{nl}Evil spirits are extremely agile and could attack when you least expect.
Thanks to you those who lie in the Mokusul Chamber can rest in peace at last.
I've taken on the work of Appraiser Master.{nl}Fedimian has always been a city where many visit, and so too are there many who request my identifying work.{nl}But what's more, because I've become the Appraiser Master even more people are requesting me. 
Even though there's a lot of work for me to do here, I still receive requests from my clients for in-person identifications.    
{nl}When this happens, it's very difficult.{nl}I understand requesting in-person visits because of personal reasons but I also have a lot to do here. 
Oh, I'm happy to hear that.{nl}If you help me, I'll teach you my identification techniques. 
{nl}After I became Appraiser Master, the Fencer Master and Orsha's Accessory Merchant, Jurus, sent me letters.{nl} Their positions keep them busy, so they requested that I make an in-person trip.     
{nl}The Fencer Master asked for identification on a family heirloom.{nl}She wants to sell her heirlooms to help the poor but she needs my certificate. 
{nl}Then, Jurus asked me to identify his shop's accessories.{nl} 
{nl}But after also becoming a Master I've sudden gotten busier and, after considering the rest of my work, I can't go.{nl}So, you see, please bring the Fencer Master's heirlooms and Orsha's accessories to me. 
{nl}If you do, I can identify them and also judge to see if I can issue certificates. 
The Fencer Master is in the Forest of Prayer, while the Accessory Merchant, Jurus, is in Orsha. 
That's the Fencer Master's heirloom..and Jurus' accessories too. {nl} Please give them to me. I'll try identifying them. 
Wow.. both are such fine items.{nl}The Fencer Master's heirloom is well kept. 
{nl}The craftsmanship level of Jurus' accessories is quite high.{nl} Even if I compare it with accessories from the nobles and royals, I can barely notice a difference. 
{nl}I will now issue the quality certificates. 
The Appraiser Master is writing the quality certificates. 
To show my thanks for helping me, I want to teach you my identification skills, but there is still a lot of work for me to do. 
{nl}Please deliver these certificates to the Fencer Master and the Accessory Merchant, Jurus.{nl}I will prepare to teach you about identification skills on your return. 
The value of the Fencer Master's heirloom is so impressive that it's an item that can't be carelessly judged.{nl}And Jurus' accessories are so beautifully and exquisitely crafted that they can't be easily imitated. 
{nl}These items cannot be thoughtlessly degraded. 
Did you deliver the certificates? 
{nl}You did well in my place.{nl}As a way to relay you, I will teach you my techniques. 
If the fragment you're carrying is imbued with divine energy, it could very well be a relic.{nl}
Allow me to have a look at it.
Your fragment looks like a simple piece of a wand.{nl}I'm... not sure if there's any divine energy in it.
{nl}Although it could be that I'm simply not skilled enough to detect it yet.
{nl}Oh, now that I think of it, I did see a few demons carrying around similar fragments.{nl}I didn't pay much attention to it then, but it would be good to investigate them.
{nl}If it's not too much to ask, would you retrieve a few of their fragments?
I will be studying the fragment we have meanwhile.{nl}Thank you.
You brought the fragments.{nl}I can confirm whether they are related to each other or not now.
After gathering all the fragments I do feel a faint divine energy, like you said.{nl}If my guesses are correct, these fragments could belong to a destroyed relic.
{nl}Destroying a holy relic like this can only be the work of Naktis or her subordinates.
{nl}Unfortunately, Inea isn't sure about the fragments, either.{nl}They do seem to form the shape of a wand, but there is no such object on our list of recovered relics.
{nl}I suppose it lost its power and value as a relic after being destroyed.{nl}And there are still many relics Inea hasn't recovered; she must have been unable to collect these fragments as well.
{nl}Oh, but she did say something that could be useful.{nl}Apparently Priest Ruodell at the Grand Corridor has found a fragment similar to these.
{nl}Take these two fragments and go see Priest Ruodell at the Grand Corridor.{nl}He can sense divine energy better than any priest. He may just find a connection between the fragments.
You brought the wand fragments.{nl}Let me have a look, then.
I found similar fragments inside the Main Chamber.{nl}The divine energy in them was so faint I nearly missed them.
{nl}I couldn't find any mention of the fragments in the order's list of recovered relics, however.{nl}They could belong to an old, forgotten relic.
{nl}I was going to try and recover the remaining fragments and bring them back to the order.{nl}But it seems we already have all of them here.
{nl}First, I'm going to use divine power to examine the fragments.{nl}If it's not too much to ask, would you handle any demons nearby?
I'm trying to see whether the relic can be restored, but it could take some time.{nl}Have you cleared the area of demons?
Fortunately I happen to have all the tools I need; I believe I can restore the relic to its original shape.
I did restore the relic using my tools and some divine power, but it still feels unstable.{nl}I suppose it's inevitable, considering it was already destroyed once.
{nl}I believe Priest Goda is preparing a magic circle at the Sanctuary.{nl}I heard he was still missing an instrument to finish the magic circle...
{nl}Would you take this wand to Priest Goda so he may use it for the magic circle?{nl}It may be a little unstable, but it does contain divine energy and I'm sure it can be used for the circle.
Unstable as it is, I don't think the wand would be considered a proper relic by the order.
{nl}I believe it will be put to better use by helping Priest Goda finish his magic circle.{nl}I suppose I'll be hearing from the order later...
Have you delivered the wand yet?{nl}You ought to hurry.
So this is the wand.{nl}I heard about it from the other priests.
As you know, I'm creating a magic circle to deal with the demons in the Sanctuary.{nl}It's a magic circle meant to weaken the power of the demons.
{nl}I haven't been able to finish it, however.{nl}I'm missing an instrument I can use to complete the magic circle.
{nl}The wand you brought looks a little unstable, like it could easily break.{nl}But I suppose the divine energy could preserve it for a while.
{nl}Would you please complete the magic circle for me?{nl}I'm afraid the demons would notice if I tried to move there myself.
After the magic circle is completed, I'll make sure to find another instrument to replace the wand.
You finished the magic circle! I already feel the demons becoming weaker.{nl}Thank you so much.
Have you seen a type of monster that looks like a tombstone? They're called Burialers.{nl}I discovered that these monsters were created by combining a tombstone and a spirit through evil energy.
{nl}I only wish I could free those poor spirits trapped in the tombstones and guide them to eternal rest...{nl}But I was so invested in the curse, I'm afraid there is no more strength left in me now.
{nl}Would you be so kind as to purify the Burialers for me while I recover?
I will give you the holy water you'll need for the purification.{nl}To see the effects, you must use the holy water only after the Burialer has been weakened.
I'll be counting on you while I recover my health.
You purified all the Burialers in the area.{nl}I feel a little better now.
{nl}I can deal with the other Burialers from now on.{nl}Thank you for your help.{nl}
Edward
Oh... Hello there. My name's Edward.{nl}I was just on my way to tend to some important issues.
{nl}Unfortunately, I was attacked by monsters on the road and they took all my equipment.{nl}Luckily I escaped in one piece, but I'm going to need a weapon for my protection.
{nl}If that's alright, would you find me my weapons?{nl}
I'm missing a dagger and a bow.{nl}They have my name carved on them, so you'll know they're mine.{nl}
Thank you.{nl}I really can't move around without my weapons.
You're something else.{nl}Thank you very much.
The truth is... my daughter suffers from a rare disease.{nl}I did see a priest who I heard had cured a child suffering from the same illness, but...
{nl}The priest says he cannot cure my daughter right away.{nl}He needs a very particular kind of flower called Davelae, is what he said.
{nl}That's the reason I came all the way here, you see...{nl}I heard from a farmer not long ago that an unknown flower had bloomed where the Tamas live.
{nl}I want to know if this flower is the one I'm looking for... Could you perhaps bring it to me?
I would go myself, but I think I sprained an ankle earlier when the monsters attacked.{nl}I saw you handle those monsters and I thought this task wouldn't be too much of a trouble for you.
I only wish this flower is the one I'm looking for...
I don't think this is a Davelae flower.{nl}It looks too different from what I heard...
{nl}I looked all around for this flower; I don't think I'll find it here.{nl}I guess I'll have to keep going up towards Shaton Farm.
{nl}I'm sorry for the trouble...
Oh, hello, nice to see you here.
{nl}I'm afraid I was, yet again, attacked by a group of monsters.{nl}They were too many to handle with my weapons alone, but fortunately I had some paralyzing poison saved up for an emergency.
{nl}I barely managed to escape; I was just catching my breath right now.{nl}I think I'm going to need more poison if I want to keep looking for that flower...
{nl}I asked the tenants if there was any herb around with paralyzing effects, but it seems not.{nl}The only thing that does have those effects is Cyst fluid.
{nl}If it was a herb I could easily pick it myself... but a monster is a little too much for me.{nl}If that's okay, can I ask you to collect some Cyst fluid for me?
I'll give you an empty flask.{nl}Please collect the Cysts' fluid in it after you defeat them.{nl}Thank you for your kindness.
I do see a few Cysts over there... but I wouldn't dare go near them.
Thank you!{nl}I can coat my arrows with the fluid now and get moving.
{nl}This... Cyst fluid smells awful, now that I notice...{nl}I wonder if that's why it paralyzes other monsters...
Well, I'm still a little sore, but I'm all set to start moving again.{nl}I looked all around the farm but the Davelae flower was nowhere to be seen... the tenants had never heard about it, either.
{nl}I hear this road leads to the Reservoir, so that's the path I'm planning to take now.{nl}If you're going in the same direction, would you care to join me?
Very well, I'll get going then.{nl}I have my poisoned arrows now, so I can deal with a monster or two.
I'm afraid I'll have to owe you another favor.
{nl}It seems the Cyst fluid I was going to use for poison has attracted the monsters.{nl}As I was running away from them I accidentally broke the flask.
{nl}Suddenly a whole horde of them came running.{nl}Sigh... My wounds haven't healed yet and now I'm out of poison. I'm in a bit of a tough spot, but I have to make it through.
{nl}This is nothing, really, compared to the pain my daughter must be going through... I need to keep moving.
You must have been worried for me.{nl}After having depended on you so many times...
My body is starting to hurt all over.{nl}I need to take a Melbania antidote and keep looking for the Davelae flower...
Thank you...!{nl}This should be enough to cure the symptoms.
I'm starting to feel better now.{nl}Oh, and also... I asked a steward here and he said he's seen a flower that looks like the Davelae.
{nl}I want to keep moving right away... but in this condition, I don't think I can get too far...{nl}If that's alright, would you bring me the flower he mentioned?
He said he saw it near the Tvirta Reservoir Embankment.
I have a feeling this will be the flower I'm looking for.{nl}If it isn't... Well, I'll just have to keep looking...
Ooohh...! It looks... exactly like the Davelae...!{nl}I've been searching for this flower for so long... I can't even remember when I started.
{nl}My daughter can finally be healthy...{nl}Thank you... thank you so much!
{nl}I need to return to my daughter right away.{nl}Thank you for finding the flower... I'm forever grateful.
Will I finally find the flower here...?
So many thoughts run through my head when I'm wandering around.{nl}Most of all I think of my daughter...
It looks like I'm all out of food for Jareth.{nl}But I can't ask the commander... I need to find some food around here.
{nl}I don't think I've recovered enough to do it on my own, though...{nl}Would you find me some meat or something I can feed to Jareth?
{nl}You can probably hunt some Cockats around here, that should work.
You'll see plenty of Cockats in this region.{nl}Thanks for the help.
I'm going to need a lot of meat, considering how much Jareth eats.
I think this should be enough.{nl}Thank you.
There's a suspicious trap here.{nl}Remove it?
Are you saying the suspicious trap you found was made to attract monsters?
{nl}That has to have been set up by Evoniphon.{nl}Although I'd never heard of a trap like that.
{nl}We would be in big trouble if one us was caught in that trap.{nl}Thank you for letting us know.
I can finally move now, but I'm still really tired and dizzy.{nl}I was wondering if you could bring me some honey from the Pendrosiums.{nl}
Wow, thank you, I appreciate it.{nl}But the thing is, you can't just catch the Pendrosiums to get to the honey.
{nl}There's this scent I use after tiring them out a little.{nl}The Pendrosiums are really sensitive to it; a little whiff and they're knocked out. That's when you get the honey.
{nl}Just put the honey in bottle.{nl}There's plenty of Pendrosiums wandering around so they shouldn't be hard to find.
I can handle the hunger, but I can't stand being this dizzy...
You filled it all the way up!{nl}Thank you!
I don't know if the Hunters think all these demons are gathering here because of Evoniphon.
{nl}But right now there are just too many demons... I can barely move around.{nl} I'm especially worried about the Infrogalas Mages.{nl}They're too many for me to handle on my own.
It's dangerous out there, so be careful.
I really think something needs to be done about the Infrogalas Mages.
These demons just keep coming back, don't they?{nl}Still, I feel a little better now.
{nl}Thank you.
I just don't feel quite safe yet, you know.{nl}The energy left behind by the Brambles is still affecting Sirdgela Forest.
{nl}And if the monsters come all the way to Viltis Forest, then there's no way we can stop them.
{nl}On the road leading to Sirdgela Forest there's a place called Zvalge Forest Way.{nl}Some time ago I installed a few devices there to stop the demons from advancing.
{nl}The monsters didn't let me carry on though, and the devices were never activated.{nl}If only I can activate them now, we wouldn't have to worry about the monsters for a while...
Thank you so much for helping!{nl}The blocking devices are little tricky to activate, though, so let me explain.
{nl}I installed the four devices underground, so you won't see them at first.{nl}The orb will react when it's near the place where they're buried, so you'll know how to find them.
{nl}Once you find the devices, you need to turn on all four.{nl}They'll shut down after a while, so you'll have to be quick here.
{nl}Only after all the devices are on can they be activated.{nl}There will be monsters around, so be careful.
If you manage to activate the devices, it will keep the monsters of Sirdgela Forest from advancing here.
I'm glad you could activate the devices, that's a big relief to hear.{nl}Thank you.
I believe I've become a little sensitive recently.{nl}I have a strange feeling.
{nl}You've probably noticed all the Loftlems wandering around.{nl}I can't tell why, but the way they're moving seems a little strange.
{nl}I feel as if I'm being watched... I want to make sure, but I'm afraid they will notice if I try to investigate.{nl}Would you face a few Loftlems and bring me anything particular you may find?
Thank you.{nl}My intuition rarely fails, you see.
{nl}Make sure to bring back anything odd you may find.
I'm also curious to know what the Loftlems' structure is like.
So the Loftlems are carrying around strange devices, you say?{nl}Let me have a look.
Hmm, I'm not sure about the device, but it seems to record images through the monsters' eyes.{nl}It also contains some demon energy.
{nl}Why would the Loftlems be recording images... And the demon energy... what does this mean?{nl}There may not be a way to eradicate all the Loftlems, but we cannot let them use these devices.
{nl}We must do something about the demon energy.{nl}I do have an idea; would you be willing to help?
I'm thinking we could use something called a Hallucination Stone on the Loftlems.{nl}First, we're going to need Liverwort spores to make the stone.
{nl}But remember not to touch live Liverwort.{nl}The vacant lot south of Pakridy Entrance has plenty of dead Liverwort to collect, so I advise you to go there.{nl}
With the Hallucination Stones, we can make the Loftlems record false images.
That's quite a lot your brought... thank you.{nl}I'll get started on the stone right away.
The Hallucination Stones are complete.{nl}Not it only needs to be buried in the grounds near the monsters.
{nl}Could I ask you to take the Stones and bury them for me?{nl}I'm afraid the monsters will suspect if they notice me doing anything unusual.
You may bury them in three different spots along the road.
I just wonder why they are collecting these images.{nl}They're monsters, what are they possibly doing with them...?
I ought to investigate this further and alert the order.{nl}I'm extremely thankful for your help.
Hang on... I can't let the Dico Tomb Thieves find those chests, though.{nl}They get a hold of them, my superiors are gonna kill me.
{nl}Oh, I got it! I can just make a few fake chests, they'll never know!{nl}If you got any time on your hands, do you wanna find me some stuff I can put inside?
I'll be here making the chests.{nl}There's a lot of Moyas around here, maybe you can get some rocks or something from them, that'd be perfect.
I hid everything at the Gerove Workshop Site; put the fake chests in a place where they can see it, too.{nl}I'm guessing they'll think they're ours and steal them.
Woah, yeah, that's more than enough.{nl}Thanks a lot.
I'm making the fake chests to fool those Dico guys.{nl}Can't let them get their hands on the stuff we have over at the Gerove Workshop Site, ya know.
{nl}I'm thinking I should get some "treasures" to plant around the fake chests, too...{nl}Have you seen those Saltisdaughter wands?
{nl}They have some sort of crystals at the end that look hella expensive.{nl}Can you bring me some of those crystals?
Alright, I'm counting on you.{nl}I'll be here preparing the rest of the chests.
I bet you those guys are just gonna take the chests without even looking inside.{nl}It's not like they have the guts to stay more than a few minutes, anyway.
Woah... Are you sure these came from the monster wands?{nl}Bet I could make some nice cash selling this stuff in the market... Thanks, anyway.{nl}I'll take care of the rest.
Guard Horton
Do you see the flooded district below the tower?{nl}There's something shiny there and I'm really curious to know what it is.
{nl}I think it might be a gem, but my boss is always watching so I can't go down and check.{nl}And I wouldn't dare go down there by myself with all the monsters around.
{nl}If you don't mind, would you go and see what it is?{nl}If it really is a gem, I'll make sure to give you a proper reward.
I think there may be more than one gem, so please look carefully.
Sometimes the guards will find antiques in the petrified city.{nl}It could very well be possible that there are treasures hidden at the Flooded District, too.
So the shiny object was an old magic circle?{nl}I don't recall hearing about a magic circle ever existing in the Flooded District.
{nl}I'm guessing it was a magic circle someone started to make a long time ago.{nl}Seeing as it was abandoned, it can't have been very important.
With the way the world is today, we don't get many supplies coming in.{nl}We're constantly short on rations, so the soldiers often need to get food from around the area.
{nl}Do you see those chests under the tower{nl}That's where we hide our emergency food supplies.
{nl}We can easily see who accesses them from the top of the tower, and the monsters don't know about them, either.{nl}If that's alright, would you bring me a bag of food from there?
{nl}I didn't have anything for breakfast and I'm a little hungry now.{nl}I'm afraid I can't leave my post... Please do me the favor.
Any chest is fine.{nl}I'll warn the other guards.
We find these emergency food supplies useful when our rations are late.
This is more than enough!{nl}I'll make sure to share with the other soldiers.
Guard Manderson
As you may know, this entire area was petrified by Ruklys' curse.
{nl}Many objects lost here are now inside the stomachs of monsters.{nl}Rumor has it they gobbled up a few expensive items as well.
{nl}Don't ask me how those things are still alive when everything else turned to stone.{nl}In any case, I would really like to find out if the rumors are true, but with my superior right in front...
{nl}If you don't mind, would you check for me?{nl}The Coastal Fortress isn't very far...
If you find anything, make sure to bring it to me immediately.
The Coastal Fortress may be dangerous, but who knows what kind of treasures are still lost there.
These are some heavy pouches you brought!
There doesn't seem to be anything good in here.{nl}There's a ring, but it looks old.
{nl}Oh, there's something engraved in it.{nl}It's a little hard to read...
{nl}Lyshys Beacon Mound?{nl}That's the name of a place... 
{nl}I wonder what it means.{nl}Would you go there and check?
Lyshys Beacon Mound is in the Coastal Fortress.{nl}The ring could be a sort of key, so make sure to take it with you.
If you find any treasures, please don't tell anyone.{nl}We're bound to get in trouble, especially if any robbers find out about it.
So it was only a meeting place for an illegal trade?{nl}That's very far from what I imagined...
{nl}No treasure, either...{nl}It doesn't sound like much, does it? I should let it go.
{nl}Oh, but do keep this a secret from Rofdel and the other guards.{nl}I wouldn't want them to misunderstand.
Coming all the way up at the start of my shift is the worst.{nl}I'm tired and it's so dangerous out here.
Sometimes our rations arrive late and we resort to emergency food supplies.{nl}Of course, the place where we keep them is a secret.
I heard some thieves were looking for expensive items in this area.{nl}Even the guards sometimes find antiques there, can you imagine?
The hardest thing for me is climbing all the way to the top of the tower.{nl}I just envy the people who work at the bottom, that's all.
I ate some Melatinun meat on my way here, but it must have been toxic.{nl}The monsters took all my food too when they stole my weapons, you see.
{nl}I've been surviving on any scraps of food I've been able to find, but I really shouldn't have eaten that Melatinun meat.{nl}I did ask around and it seems the Melania herbs that grow nearby are detoxifying.
{nl}I need to gather all the strength I can and go find the Davelae, but in this condition...{nl}If you can, please bring me some Melania...
Welcome.{nl}Oh, I don't believe I've seen you before, adventurer.
{nl}There may be few of us, but we are working hard to stop the demons.{nl}That said, we can always use the help of any brave adventurers.
{nl}If you enter this mission, you must protect the Divine Torch from the demons.{nl}This may sound simple, but be careful, as the demons become stronger and stronger over time.
{nl}Once in a while you will also see a treasure chest appear; be sure to open it.{nl}Now, if you wish to enter the mission, just give me the word.
This is a warning to all adventurers attempting to enter the Narcon Prison!{nl}The Royal Army has reported that this dungeon is currently inhabited by large numbers of demons.
There was an unidentified magic piece discovered near Gaudezi Altar.{nl} After talking with Maras, go find Lamar. 
Report to the Cleric Master, who manages the sanctuary.
