Bokor. You've chosen a difficult path. {nl}Refer to the instructions in your Adventure Journal and make your own doll.
You must make a doll by yourself. {nl}Check your Adventure Journal to see how you can make the doll. 
Congratulations, a new Bokor is born. {nl}When I first chose the path of a Bokor, I started by creating a doll of my own. 
Peltasta Master
If you want to receive my teachings then you have to prove your worth first.{nl}Here's a challenge: Defeat some Vubbes on the 1st Floor of the Crystal Mine.
How can you bear the title of Peltasta if you can't even handle that much? 
Good. {nl}I hope your new growth leads to you saving the world. 
Highlander Master
I'm so thankful that you want to be the successor of my swordsmanship, but I suspect that you won't follow my teachings well.{nl}I will test you by having you defeat the Vubbes that are occupying the 1st floor of the Crystal Mine.
Hurry. {nl} Although this is your initiation challenge, the Vubbes are a threat to the Miners' Village.
Good work, you've completed your initiation in becoming a Highlander. {nl} Keep up the hard work and dedication.
Pyromancer Master
I can see that you want to learn magic from me, but I can't teach just anyone. {nl}I will see how well you can assist my research and then decide. 
Good work. Thanks to you I can start the next step of my research. {nl}I will teach you Pyromancer magic as promised. 
Good, you're here. I need you to defeat the evil spirits that I will summon. {nl}I will record the unique wavelength that is transmitted in the process. 
I am doing research on the 4th state of matter. {nl}It is impossible without the cooperation of the Bokor Master, who deals with spirits. 
Yes, splendid. {nl}Tell the Pyromancer Master that we have all the materials we need. 
Good. {nl}That study is being done with the Bokor Master. So go pay her a visit and she'll tell you what to do. 
Cryomancer Master
You want to learn Cryomancer magic from me? {nl}Sure, I'll teach you, but only if you take care of something first! 
The Pyromancer Master should not be around. {nl}So it'll be an easy task.
Don't feel guilty about it. You did a good job. {nl}I've got your back from now on, so you don't need to worry. 
It's sneaking into the Pyromancer Master's room and opening a box. {nl}As for what's inside the box...Well, you'll just have to kill it off.
This will be enough. {nl}My magic is not easy, so you will need to work hard to keep up. 
Your will to learn from me is good, but first I have a favor to ask. {nl}We can continue our talk if you are up for it. {nl}
Lydia Schaffen's gears are like divine materials to us archers. {nl}I would give up my entire fortune just to have them.
I never imagined that I would see this myself. {nl}Thank you. I will teach you thoroughly from now on, so you better be prepared. 
I heard the lost telescope lens from the Astral Tower is in Crystal Mine 1F. {nl}Get me that lens before the other masters find out and I'll teach you my techniques. 
So you want to learn the way of the arrow from me...Then I have a mission for you. {nl}I will base my decision on how well you accomplish the mission. 
Evoniphon...I will never forgive him.
Hunter Master
You collected all the books. Good job. {nl}I will teach you the way of a Hunter as promised. 
You got some good results. I will teach you from now on. {nl}I hope you live up to my expectations. 
I heard the bats in Crystal Mine 1F have a special type of venom. {nl}I'm sure it's the same venom used by the assassin Evoniphon. Bring me that venom.
Barbarian Master
You can understand an opponent's abilities by facing them sword to sword. {nl}Prove to me that you are a true warrior, and I will lead you in becoming a real Barbarian. 
You indeed qualify as a warrior. {nl}I will make you become a true Barbarian. 
I understand that you want to be stronger with a spear. {nl}Complete the mission I assign to you, and I will teach you my spearmanship.
Please bring me Groll Leather from Spineheart Dale, Chafperor Poison Darts from the Fallen Worry Forest, and Jukopus Black Powder from Miners' Village.
I understand your will to become stronger. {nl}I also see that you may have what it takes to be good with spears.
Psychokino Master
If you want to understand Psychokino, then how about you work as my assistant?{nl}I will guarantee you that it is an attractive job.
Please, first defeat Matsums from Spineheart Dale and collect their flower alcohol.{nl}They break easily so it's hard to get the decent ones.
Good. The flower alcohol from the Matsums is okay.{nl}You will see something interesting soon.
Now go to Gintara Highway at Spineheart Dale.{nl}Sprinkle this liquid medicine onto the experimental Matsum doll that I installed and let me know the result.
The Matsums attacked you? {nl}Since the Matsums accepted the Matsum dolls as their friends, I consider it successful. 
Good work. {nl}You've done a good job as my assistant, so I'll teach you what being a Psychokino truly means. 
My research is about the methods of shifting psychokinesis to the substance of matter. {nl}In other words...It's a method of brainwashing by using medicine. 
Linker Master
Temperament is very important for Linkers. {nl}While it may be easy to shut out one's heart, opening it up requires a special kind of temperament. {nl}
I will test you to see if you have such temperament. 
Good. However, you must prepare some materials before taking the test.{nl}Bring me Thornball Thorns and Fragments of Velwriggler from the Gate Route.
Excellent! {nl}But this is just to prepare you for the test. {nl}
I will start the test now. {nl}Behind the Gate Route is a rip in the space of the world.{nl}
Normal people are only capable of seeing reality as is, but if you have the temperament of a Linker, {nl}you should be able to perceive a hidden world. {nl}Find the book from there and bring it to me. 
Have you gone there yet? {nl}Just go to the Gate Route and check. I've marked the location on the map.{nl}
Looks like you found the book. With this, you have passed my test. {nl} Nevertheless, please read that book to demonstrate your determination as a Linker. 
So you want me to teach you the skills of a Sapper... well then you must customarily pay a fee for my service. {nl}Not to me. But rather, I want you to give a donation to the Cleric Master in Klaipeda. {nl}Let's say, around 5000 silver? 
Wait, there's one more thing. {nl}I hid some objects at Flude Island in the Siauliai Western Woods.{nl}Before you go to Klaipeda, find the objects first and return them to their original owners in Klaipeda.{nl}{nl} 
Oh, this. I saw it somewhere...hmm...it looks familiar...{nl}Well I'll take it with gratitude since you're giving it to me.
Ah, this is the tool I lost. {nl}Thanks. Where was it?
Did you forget about the donation? {nl}It's 5000 silver.
Cleric Master
Thank you, in the name of the goddess.{nl}I promise the donations will be used for those injured by monsters. {nl}
I used to be a thief, but I came to realize certain things and I stopped my criminal life. {nl}But there is a small matter left on my mind... and I want to resolve it now. {nl}
Anyway, you did a good job. {nl}Let's cooperate from now on, teaching and learning from each other. 
I'm looking for a book. Four books by Lydia Schaffen. {nl}If you help me find the books, I will teach you my skills. 
The book used to be in Miners' Village, but it was lost when the Vubbes raided. {nl} Try visiting the Vubbe Outpost.
This is the book. You will need this book if you dream to be the best Archer. {nl}I will make you a copy if you can gather the entire book collection. 
The Quarrel Shooter Master holds the next book. {nl}He was looking for Merog leather earlier. Maybe you can try making a deal with him using that.
Do you have the Merog leather yet from the Hunter Master?
This is of good quality. The Hunter Master will be pleased. {nl}You can take the book. {nl}
Merogs are in the Fallen Worry Forest, and the Quarrel Shooter Master is in Klaipeda. {nl}Someone might get ahead of you, so better hurry.
The Archer Master in Klaipeda has the next book. {nl}He's not a mean person, so he will give you the book if you ask nicely. {nl}
He is helping with the repair of the damaged city wall. {nl}I heard the rocks are delivered from the Miners' Village, so bringing some to him can be a way to ask. 
Did the Hunter Master tell you to send this? {nl}If you're looking for Lydia Schaffen's book, you could have just asked. But thanks anyway. 
The last book is with the Ranger Master in Klaipeda. {nl}Give her this pouch. {nl}I could go myself, but we're not really comfortable seeing each other. 
Don't ask why. Work is work, and it's a fact that we don't want to see each other. 
This pouch...Did you come from the Hunter Master? {nl}Here. Take this book to her. 
Although that woman acted humble to you, she's pretty scary whenever she approaches me. 
This will be enough leather. {nl}Bring them to the Quarrel Shooter Master before someone else does. 
This rock will be useful in repairing the wall. {nl}Bring it to the Archer Master quickly. 
Are you the one who wants to learn my skills? {nl}Great, I was just looking for someone to help me find Lydia Schaffen's book. {nl}You're going to help, right? 
There was one volume in the Miners' Village, but it was lost when the Vubbes raided. {nl} I'm pretty sure it's in the Vubbe Outpost now.
Ho-ho yep, this is it. {nl}This will be helpful for people like you, who dream of becoming a Quarrel Shooter. {nl}I will give you a copy if you collect the entire book collection. 
Three more left. {nl}I think you can get one of them by giving some money to the Hunter Master.
The problem is, I'm broke. 
You mean Lydia Schaffen's book that I have? {nl}I'll hand it over for 5000 silver.
You heard me right, please pay the price . {nl}Around 5000 silver will do. {nl}
5000 silver...Yup, that's right. {nl}I'll give you the book as promised. 
Well...the Archer Master must have the next book. {nl}He's still helping repair the wall, so wouldn't he appreciate it if you got him some rocks? {nl}I could take them to him myself, but...owwww...my back.
The Archer Master has the next book. {nl}He's not a mean person, so he will give you the book if you ask nicely. {nl}
I heard he is helping repair the damaged city wall. {nl}Rocks were delivered from the Miners' Village, and he'll be moved if you bring him one. 
Did the Hunter Master told you to send this? {nl}If you're here for Lydia Schaffen's book, you could have just asked. But thank you anyway. 
Now, for the last book. {nl}Give this pouch to the Ranger Master and get the book. 
Did the Quarrel Shooter Master send this? {nl}Thanks. I'll hand over the book as promised. 
Bring the book quickly. {nl}I can't hold it. 
Great, it's this one! {nl}I'll teach you the skills of a Quarrel Shooter as promised. {nl}
This rock will be useful in repairing the wall. {nl}Bring it to the Archer Master quickly. 
If you want to learn more of my skills, there is a condition. {nl}I want you to help me find the four books by Lydia Schaffen. 
I heard the first book was with a resident in Miners' Village before the Vubbes attacked. {nl}So I think it could be in the Vubbe Outpost now. 
I'm surprised you found it so fast! {nl}And it's in good condition. {nl}
I think you might be able to buy the next book from the Hunter Master...{nl}I'm broke after paying to fix the wall. Haha...
You mean the second book by Lydia Schaffen? {nl}I'll hand it over for 5000 silver. 
I think around 5000 silver will do. {nl}I heard that's the book's value. 
Ah, you came at the right time.{nl}If you could take Merog leather to the Quarrel Shooter Master, he will make you a copy of the next volume.
Did the Merog leather come from the Archer Master?
You will find Merogs at the Fallen Worry Forest.{nl}Take those to the Quarrel Shooter Master in Klaipeda.
The quality is fine enough. The Archer Master will be pleased. {nl}Here, I've prepared a copy, so take it. 
Now there is one book left. {nl}Give this pouch to the Ranger Master and get the book. {nl}
Did the Archer Master send you? {nl}Well, good work. I'll give you the book as promised. 
Isn't the book ready yet? {nl}I want to see all of Lydia Schaffen's book as soon as possible...
Finally, it's all here. {nl}I'll teach you my skills as promised. 
I have some books to collect. They're Lydia Schaffen's books. {nl}I'll teach you my skills if you collect the books. What do you say? 
The first book was in the Miners' Village, but it disappeared after the Vubbes attacked. {nl}I assume the book is in the Vubbe Outpost? 
Oh, that's pretty good. {nl}It will be helpful for you to read it too. 
The problem is the Hunter Master. I really don't want to see her face. {nl}So you go and get the next book from her. 
You mean the book I have? {nl}Well, okay. I'll hand it over for 5000 silver. 
I think around 5000 silver will do. {nl}Can you spare that much? 
You came at the right time.{nl}The Quarrel Shooter Master told you that if you could bring Merog leather, he will make you a copy of the next volume.
Didn't the Ranger Master tell you anything?{nl}I asked him for Merog leather.
Merogs are at the Fallen Worry Forest and the Quarrel Shooter Master is in Klaipeda. {nl}Someone may go there and get the book faster than you, so please hurry.
The book is in good condition.{nl}Now, bring the book to the Archer Master. {nl}
The Archer Master in Klaipeda has the last book. {nl}I heard he is repairing the wall, so this might help you get the book. 
I heard there is a rock that will be useful for repairing the wall in the Miners' Village. {nl}Bring that to the Archer Master as a present. 
Did the Hunter Master told you to send this? {nl}If you're here for Lydia Schaffen's book, you could have just asked. But thank you anyway. 
You finally collected them all. Good work. {nl}I will teach you my skills as promised, but it's your job to keep track and follow along.
You got some good quality leather. {nl}Bring it to the Quarrel Shooter Master. 
Why did you bring that to me? Take it to the Archer Master quickly.
Sculptor Tesla
A sculptor's talent is important, but so is having an eye for seeing important materials. {nl}I will help you learn my skills if you bring me the blue crystals I'm looking for. 
That is the problem. {nl}The Yekub swallowed it as soon as it was found on the 2nd Floor of the Miners' Village. 
Oh, this is it. {nl}I have a lot of time, so I will teach you thoroughly.
You want to learn the swordsmanship of a Highlander from me? {nl}I will consider it if you can get cooperation from the Peltastas.
As compensation for seeking cooperation, just support 5 boards of wooden buckler type.{nl}Defeating Upents at Indigo Trees Plateau will be enough.
Thank you for the supplies, but the Highlander Master wouldn't have sent you for just that. {nl}Tell me what you want. {nl}
An overall cooperation between the Masters? Certainly. {nl}Tell him that the Peltastas will cooperate. 
If the Masters unite, it won't be long until the kingdom rises again. {nl}You did a good job. I will teach you my swordsmanship.
That should be enough. {nl}Now go seek the cooperation with the Peltasta Master. 
We Peltastas promised the Highlanders we would lend our forces to rebuild the kingdom.{nl}So if you want to learn from me, you should also be responsible.{nl}
Meet Uska and lend your force.
So you came here at the request of the Peltasta Master.{nl}The Highlander Master once guaranteed that he would get support from the other masters. {nl}
We, Peltastas, consider our duties as humans to be most important. 
We, Peltastas, consider our duties as humans to be most important. 
I was about to ask for aid in the search. {nl}
I sent 4 scouts to the Spineheart Dale, but they all disappeared.{nl}Maybe they didn't think the Thorn Forest was that dangerous... Please find them.
Some issue may have emerged.{nl}Please go to the Spineheart Dale quickly.
These...were their keepsakes. {nl}We can at least give the keepsakes to their families. Thank you. {nl}
I will tell the Highlander Master myself, so please go back. {nl}Good work. 
It might not be a pleasant feeling, but that's good enough. {nl}I will allow you to learn the way of the Peltasta as promised. 
I need to gather the energy of fire for my research, but I just don't have time. {nl}If you gather it for me, I will help you learn the magic of Pyromancers.
Be careful. The pot will break if you don't keep an eye on it. 
Please put this pot on the ground when you go to the Descended Tree Garden.{nl}After that, when you defeat the enemies nearby, energies will be accumulated in the pot.
There is an important book that I'm looking for. {nl}If you get me that book, I will help you learn the magic of Cryomancers. 
Did you say you'll find the book? {nl}Sorry, but you're late. 
I heard rumors that it's in the Miners' Village, but I don't know the exact location of it. {nl}Maybe the Mayor would know...
The Vubbes took all the books when they attacked. {nl}Maybe they will use it for fire in their outpost. 
If there was something like that, we would have taken care of it. {nl}You can go and try looking for it. 
You found it. Great job. {nl}You'll have to work really hard to follow my training. 
I heard the book was last seen in the Miners' Village. {nl}It's a very important book, so maybe the Mayor might know something about it.
You must have found the book. I don't know how, but congratulations. {nl}Why don't you go back to the one who's waiting for that book? 
Krivis Master
A Krivis should be free from the constraints of humans and dedicate themselves to the clergy. {nl}This is done by offering dedication prayers to all the Goddess Statues in Siauliai. {nl}
Repent. {nl}Ask the goddess for forgiveness and be born anew. 
I can feel that you are full of the goddess' blessings. {nl}Welcome to your new life as a Krivis. 
Swordsman Master
An old saying goes, fight to the death and you will survive. {nl}I will be able to teach you if you come to realize what it means. 
You haven't realized what it means. {nl}Fight a bit more. 
Right... Now do you understand? {nl}Remember that you're a Swordsman and devote yourself to being one. 
Then fight against Mentiwood at the Seven Hues Mesa.{nl}You may learn something from doing this.
The most important thing for a Priest is to believe in the goddess, and prove it. {nl}Exorcise the soldiers possessed with evil spirits in the name of goddess. 
The soldier is being taken care of in the Miners' Village. {nl}Your sincerity will become your strength. 
Your sincerity has been proven. {nl}We will walk together in the name of the goddess. 
Learning magic from me comes after helping my research. {nl}Let's talk about the talent problem afterwards. 
First get me Skins of Grolls from the Spineheart Dale, Feelers of Chafperors from Fallen Worry Forest, {nl}And lastly, the nuclei from Jukopus. I am counting on you.
You've gathered everything. {nl}Now let's move on to the next step. 
Klaipeda is far from the capital and was barely attacked by the monsters. {nl}I paid attention to that point, and I am studying to make a great magic circle. {nl}
And for that, I need to accumulate data. {nl}Can you use this scroll around the city? 
I've marked on the map where you need to install it. {nl}You need to use it on every single point. 
Good work. I've gathered some useful data with your help. {nl}My research is complete so you can come to train anytime.
You must have come to learn the faith of Clerics. {nl}I will teach you if you help by treating the injured soldiers of Miners' Village. 
The Cleric Master shines light on many at such a young age. {nl}Take this holy water and go to the patients quickly. 
You need holy water to treat them. {nl}You should get holy water from the Priest Master and Krivis Master first. 
If it's for the Cleric Master, take as much holy water as you need. {nl}She has a beautiful heart that even this old priest would envy. 
Please send my regards to the Cleric Master. {nl}May the blessings of the goddess be with you. 
Please send them my regards while you get holy water from the masters. 
Service is what you do for others, but it is also a way of cleansing your own reflection. {nl}I hope your wandering soul will be cleansed as you treat patients. 
Good job. {nl}I will teach you the faith of Clerics, as promised. 
I think that you may not have a great spear right away, {nl}but you must have a spear that you are strongly attached to. {nl}What do you think about it? 
Spears are the pride of Hoplites. {nl}A strong spear is something that Hoplites can boast, like their name.
That's great. {nl}Alright. You have what it takes to learn spearmanship from me. 
Alright. {nl}If you want my recognition, show me a spear upgraded to level 6.{nl}
The reality changes as you think. And only thoughts make it possible.{nl}That's called supernatural power. {nl}And the intensity of it will vary based on how much one trusts himself...{nl}
Ah, I only told you boring things.{nl}You want to be a Psychokino, right?{nl}If you could help me a bit, then I will help you so that you can release the strong supernatural power that is hidden inside of you. 
Go to the Nardymo Twin Waterfall in the Goddess' Ancient Garden. {nl}Please bring me the Essence of Demons there.{nl}Okay... I am counting on you.
Okay. This is it.{nl}By looking at its color, I can see it is full of demonic power.{nl}Haha! I will teach you the true power of a Psychokino from now on, so be ready!
You want to learn Quarrel Shooter Skills from me? {nl}Right on time. I was also looking for someone to help me.
You were sent by the Quarrel Shooter Master, right? {nl}You must find a map. A map hidden with the Fletcher's secrets. 
The Sapper Master says he found some information about the book I'm looking for. {nl}Go to the East Siauliai Woods and meet him. 
The colleague of mine who sneaked into the Mage Tower some time ago told me that he saw a strange map.{nl}I think the map is what I am looking for.
He told me a Minotaur has it somewhere on the 3rd floor.{nl}He had troubles because of that monster, so you should prepare yourself well.
Oh, is this the map? Good job. {nl}I'll teach you my skills as promised. 
Is this the map? I really can't tell. {nl}Take it to the Quarrel Shooter Master. 
So you came to learn more skills from me. {nl}Then go help the Rodelero Master in Fedimian. I will evaluate you based on that. 
Did the Archer Master send you?{nl}Klaipeda is becoming stable but Fedimian is still at risk. 
I hear that most of Fedimian, aside from Holy District, is buried and in need of help. 
I want you to defeat the boss monster in the Mage Tower. {nl}Monsters are pouring out of the tower {nl}and we are having troubles as it is rebuilding Fedimian.
According to the scout who made it in, there was a Minotaur on the 3rd Floor of the Mage Tower. {nl}Defeating it will be good enough to serve as a warning. 
Well done. Thanks to you, the monsters have been warded off. {nl}Extend my gratitude to the Archer Master as well. 
Well done. {nl}I will train you to be stronger as promised. 
You want to learn the skill of a Ranger from me? {nl}Okay. If you help me, I'll consider it depending on how you do. 
Evoniphon. {nl}It seems that the Ranger Master still has some regrets.{nl}
I saw the Elementalist Master talking to the man in a hoodie.{nl}I can't guarantee if that was him, but I can't forget that unique fragrance.
I heard you're looking for someone who wears a hoodie and has a unique scent. {nl}
Of course I remember. It was a man with a dangerous scent. {nl}He asked about materials that not many people know about so I thought he was strange. {nl}
Evoniphon... I will never forget it. 
After talking with the Elementalist Master briefly, he disappeared into the darkness.{nl}Please go see him.
How would I know his whereabouts. {nl}He asked about materials I did not have so I told him where he could get it. 
I told him that he would be able escape from the 3rd floor of Mage Tower.{nl}That is the place where the famous Rodelero's search squad also ran away from.
This scent... yes, it's Evoniphon's.{nl}This will be enough. I will teach you my skills as promised. 
Yes, this is the scent. {nl}It was very unique so I couldn't forget it even if I wanted to. {nl}
I am looking for traces of one man. His name is Evoniphon.{nl}I heard the Squire Master in Fedimian has information about him so please go see him.
Hey, if you came here to be stronger, you've come to the right place. {nl}But you can't have it for nothing. You have to do me a favor. {nl}
It's not a big task. I want you to help one of my experiments...{nl}First defeat Drakes at the 1st Floor of the Mage Tower and collect flame catalysts.
Drakes are actually nothing, but the problem is that the monsters nearby are more dangerous.{nl}Umm... Cheer up!
Oh, right. You should be able to do it easily if you want to become a Sapper. {nl}Now you just have to help with the experiment. 
Well, it's pretty simple. {nl}Check how effective this bomb is on the monsters in East Siauliai Woods.
I hope it works this time...
They fell back without much damage? {nl}Hmm, what could the problem be...I'll need to check from the beginning again. {nl}
Anyways, Thanks. {nl}You can come back anytime if you want to learn my skills. 
You want to learn about the Bokors? {nl}Then first, get me a card from a powerful monster out there. 
It doesn't matter which card it is as long as it's from a powerful monster. {nl}What you will bring to me is already decided. 
Complete. Traveler. Promised victory. Perfected world. {nl}Finding a full interpretation is up to you.
Sometimes the destined, harsh fate can lead to a dark future. {nl}I will lead you through the path of the Bokor as promised. 
I'm looking for a cat that can model but I'm old and it's not easy. {nl}Bring a suitable cat and I'll teach you my skills. 
Grandpa Tesla wants a cat? {nl}There are plenty of cats over at Klaipeda Plaza, but {nl}it won't be easy to catch one without special food. 
I like cats because they do the basics. {nl}The cats have all lines. 
I can give you special cat food for catching a cat. {nl}If you find my father, I will give it to you for free!
My father is a merchant who used to often come to Fedimian.{nl}He told me he would go to the Mage Tower to do some trades and never returned.{nl}
One of Fedimian's soldiers told me that he saw a merchant's luggage on the 3rd floor of the Mage Tower.{nl}You are the only one I can ask for a favor. I am counting on you!
This is the symbol that I engraved on my father's sleeve..{nl}This is very precious to me. Thanks.
I'll give you the special cat food as promised. {nl}It's made with stuff that the cats like so it should work.
Oh oh, it's that cat. {nl} As promised, let me lead you to a higher ground. {nl}
I've traded for a long time with a Klaipeda Item Merchant, so they might help you. 
I want you to do something in return for learning magic from me. {nl}It's simple but a little dangerous. Would you like to give it a try? {nl}
Just put this pot in the reading room that is at the 1st floor of the Mage Tower.{nl}The problem is that there are Chapparition that are standing in the reading room... I think you would be more than able to defeat them.
If you find it dangerous, please get out quickly. {nl}I'll just have to find another disciple. 
Good work. {nl}I will teach Pyromancy as promised. {nl}
I can promise you a higher level of strength. {nl}Of course, it won't come for free.
Please bring the Beaks of Cockatrices from the Crystal Brook, and Scales of Arma from the 3rd floor of the Mage Tower.{nl}It shouldn't be too hard for you.{nl}
Well done. {nl}I'll help you become stronger.
You've come to the right place if you want to practice stronger magic. {nl}But you can't learn from me with your weak determination.
I can see your passion, but what about your abilities? {nl}Bring me a Phyracon Fragment and a Green Drake Scale in the Mage Tower.
Great job. But I still have my doubts. {nl}I'll decide depending on how well you assist my work.
I used to do research on town defense magic and I think we can try that in Fedimian. {nl}But in order to do that I'll need a lot of data. {nl}
Your job is to use this data recording scroll in Fedimian.
I've marked on your map where you should use it. {nl}Use it at each location.
Good work. You wanted to take magic to the next level right? {nl}I'm very strict so I hope you follow along well.
Healing the body also heals the soul. {nl}If you want to take yourself to the next level, then service others by healing them.
There are still many people who need treatment. {nl}Share your kindness with them.
The goddess helps those who help. {nl}It may not be much, but I hope I can be of assistance in taking you to the next level.
Cataphract...{nl}I'm not sure if you have the strength to learn.
I like your courage.{nl}Show your skills by defeating Sparnasman in the Rhombuspaving Dale. 
Great work. You seem qualified to learn my skills. {nl}Oh, and I apologize for underestimating you.
A Cataphract is the one who stands at the front lines and fights.{nl}Destroy everything that is an obstacle to completing your task.{nl}I just remembered something appropriate.
There are monsters that attack tourists in Sunset Flag Forest.{nl}You should eliminate such dangerous monsters as quickly as possible.{nl}If you complete the task without any problems, I will acknowledge your skill.
Congratulations on passing the test.
Put all of your focus on one point and pierce the enemy. {nl}Of course, you're not yet at that level so I'll approve if you just defeat it.
Sorcerer Master
If you want to learn magic from me, you must show me how strong you are. {nl}It's simple, win a magic duel against me.
Don't be scared. I'll take it down to your level. {nl}I'll meet you in the vacant area of the plaza.
Alright. You seem tough enough. {nl}You can come to me anytime you want to learn magic.
Necromancer Master
Necromancer spells will devour the spell caster if their soul is not well trained. {nl}Fight me and prove how strong your soul is.
Wait in the vacant area of the plaza.
Well, that's good enough to start. {nl}I'll teach you the spell of Necromancers.
Druid Master
You need to awaken your senses first if you want to become a Druid. {nl}I'll awaken your senses to flow with nature through a duel.
There's not enough space here so I'll see you at the vacant area of the plaza.
You have some special senses. {nl}If I can lead you well as a Druid, your future will look promising.
Only combat makes us stronger. {nl}Prove yourself if you want to learn from me!
Our ways are simple. {nl}If you live, you have what it takes and if not, you don't. {nl}Since you are alive, you are worth it.
If you're qualified, I'll take your mana to the next level as a Linker. {nl}It doesn't matter which magic it is. I'll test you through a duel.
I tested you at your level and you appear qualified. {nl} As promised, I will help you sharpen your mana.
Hunters talk only with arrows. {nl}I will tone it down to your level so if you want to learn from me, {nl}you have to overcome me.
You won this duel. {nl}I will train you as promised.
You must have strength if you want to learn the Highlander's sword. {nl}Show me what you have. {nl}{nl}
I see that you have the bravery and strength that suits a Highlander. {nl}I will take you to the next level with the honor of becoming a Highlander.
I heard Sparnasman at the Rhombuspaving Dale is threatening people.{nl}It will not be easy, but it will be enough to test your skills. 
When you're holding a shield, your courage is important since you should not avoid enemy's attack, but return the attack instead.{nl}Before you learn from me, you should show me how brave you are.{nl}{nl}
Defeat Chapparition at the 1st floor of the Mage Tower.{nl}That bleakness will be enough to test your courage.
I understand your bravery from this. {nl}Always make yourself a proud one for your shield.
Sincerity is the strength of a Krivis. {nl}Prove your sincerity through a duel with me.
The duel will take place in my Training Room. {nl}I will see you there.
Your sincerity is as firm as stone pillars. {nl}I'll lead you to a higher level as promised.
The faith of a Priest should be unshakable no matter what. {nl}I will test you to see how strong your faith is through a duel. {nl}
The duel will take place in my Training Room. {nl}You go first.
I see that your faith is strong from the outside but deep inside, I still see hesitation. {nl}
Throw away the hesitation and fill it with the grace of the goddess. {nl}I will help you reach a higher level through this grace.
A Swordsman should swing their sword with no hesitation. {nl}Hesitation is a gap in one's heart. The enemy will always be looking for that gap. {nl}
There's a Minotaur on Mage Tower 3F. {nl}Fight it and throw away any hesitation of the sword.
Hesitation is a dangerous weakness. {nl}I hope you are able to realize that.
Alright... You have what it takes to further develop yourself. {nl}Keep devoting yourself to training.
Centurion Master
The path of a Centurion, is by no means an easy path to take. {nl}But it's a different story if you win a duel with me. What do you think?
The duel will take place in the vacant area of the plaza, so be there first.
That is enough. {nl}I will take the responsibility of teaching you.
Sadhus train by training their soul to become stronger. {nl}I will check through a duel...to see if your soul is prepared enough to take on our training.
Let's duel at the empty lot in the square.{nl}I will adjust to your level so don't worry too much.
I can see your will. {nl}Welcome to the Sadhu.
Hackapell Master
It's good that you want to learn my combat skills, but first I need to check your abilities. {nl}I'll need to know your weaknesses in order to teach you.
I'll see you at the vacant area in the plaza. {nl}Be there first.
This seems enough. {nl}Harsh training will begin now.
Wugushi Master
Wugushis don't hesitate to use poison. {nl}Before you learn anything, I'll show you how we fight. {nl}Arrows or airguns, I'll show you with whatever it takes.
Let's meet in the vacant area of the plaza. {nl}This place is too small, others might get hurt.
See that? This is how Wugushis fight. {nl}You'll need to throw away your guilt of using foul methods if you want to be a Wugushi.
If you really want to be a Rodelero, check your shield again. {nl}When I first chose the path of Rodelero, I began with getting a Level 6 Shield.
Prepare a Level 6 Shield. {nl}I need to check your will at least.
You have perseverance unlike the rest of the youth nowadays. {nl}Come by anytime you want to learn.
I trust my judgment more than anybody. {nl}I will check through a duel if you have what it takes to be with the Squires.
The sword is sharper when you believe in yourself.
I can see your skills. {nl}I hope you will become even greater from now on with my teachings.
Thaumaturge Master
Thaumaturge magic is one of the most difficult magic but I can lead you well. {nl}Do me a favor and I will guide you in the path of the Thaumaturge.
There are many research documents which the Magicians left at the Mage Tower when they ran away from the tower.{nl}Please bring back the research documents from the 3rd floor of the Mage Tower.
You completed it faster than I expected.{nl}That's good. I'll help you pull out the abilities of the Thaumaturge inside you.
Put aside the boring theories and get to the actual battle. {nl}It's a simple mission. Go back if you don't wish to fulfill it.
Please collect the body fluids of Slimes, and bone fragments from Hallowventers at the Crystal Brook,{nl}and lastly activate the nucleus of Grave Golems at Remaining Tree Dale.
Good work. {nl}Since you've completed your mission, let's begin the duel right away.
Scout Master
Being a Scout doesn't mean you're only good at hiding and infiltration. {nl}You also need to have combat skills to be a true Scout. {nl}
Prove yourself in a duel against me, then I'll teach you my secret skills.
You have pretty good senses. {nl}But my training can't be done by sense alone so better keep up.
Paladin Master
We have followed the goddess and fought for justice and belief.{nl}If you truly want to learn from the Paladins, you need to prove your faith.
Sparnasman at Rhombuspaving Dale would be enough for your reputation. {nl}Please show us the power of the knight who serves the goddesses.
At least you weren't bluffing. {nl}Good. You're approved to learn as a Paladin.
So you want to learn from the Highlanders. {nl}Alright. But there is a condition.
You're the support from the Highlander Master. {nl}It's urgent so I'll get straight to the point.
There's a problem in the Crystal Mine and Commander Uska asked us for support. {nl}But we, the Peltastas, don't have the time right now.{nl}
So I want you to help Commander Uska for us.
A pledge is important. {nl}I cannot accept anything that breaks the trust in the current confusing state.
I thought it would be difficult even when we were asking for support. {nl}But now we're relieved that you're the support.
The Highlanders and Peltastas' honor is on the line. {nl}Please help Commander Uska.
There are rumors that a huge monster is roaming around the Crystal Mine 2F. {nl}The mines are an important industry for Klaipeda so we can't just idly stand by. {nl}
So please check the Crystal Mine' 2nd Floor and get rid of the source of the rumors.
The safety of the villagers is on the line. {nl}Please search it thoroughly.
I can't believe there's still that kind of thing left...{nl}It's a relief that no one was hurt. {nl}We should consider sending the elite troops until the Crystal Mine is stable.
Anyway, thank you for the hard work and send my thanks to the Highlander Master. {nl}I will thank the Peltasta Master when I meet her soon.
Good work. Now the Pelatastas owe me another one.{nl}I will lead you as the Highlander Master promised.
Seems like I get your help a lot. {nl}Please take care of Klaipeda in the future too.
You want to learn from me? {nl}Alright, I'll accept you if you do me a favor.
Did the Peltasta Master send you? {nl}If it's about the shield, I already know.
If we don't get the supplies then we don't have to keep the pledge with the Highlanders. {nl}Also, our trust will be broken.
I should have sent a letter of apology but I wasn't able to. {nl}There will be word from a client soon so wait for a while.
How many times has this occurred!{nl}I am sorry, but please go meet the Fletcher Master and find out what happened.{nl}Go to the Remaining Tree Dale.
Fletcher Master
Did you come from Klaipeda? {nl}You can't even if you rush it. Go back.
Did you not hear me? {nl}It will be a long time before it is your turn.
I haven't been this mad since that tree took my workshop to the sky {nl}Four years ago on Medzio Diena.
Did you get rid of it? That's great to hear. {nl}One less reason for the lazy Fedimian merchants.
I will be able to send the rest of the stuff soon, as promised. {nl}You can go back now. I need to concentrate.
I can keep a good relationship with the Highlanders with your help. {nl}I will lead you as the Peltasta Master has promised.
I will send my disciple to the Highlander Master so don't worry about that.
It's emotional to see that there's someone willing to learn from a person like me. {nl}Alright, if you get my things back, I will teach you the skills of Corsair.
That idiot of an assistant captain took everything and fled to the Great Cathedral.{nl}Monsters may have them. I hope so.
Now that's something! {nl}I will teach you the skills of a Corsair, as promised.
Fight with all that you've got. I will show you how to fight with sword and shield. {nl}Remember that it depends on your abilities, whether I teach you or desert you.
Do you think otherwise even when your best is not enough?
You have a bad habit. But it could be changed. {nl}I teach strictly so you better be prepared.
Teaching you skills will not be a problem as long as you do me a favor. {nl}
There's something I requested of the Fletcher Master but there's no news yet. {nl}I want you to check on it. I'm more worried about the person than the thing...
Did the Archer Master worry? I'm fine. {nl}If there's a problem, it's that the materials can't follow my crafting speed.
Well he's hot tempered so... Please take care of it.
I think it'll be over soon if you gather good stones from the Penitence Route of the Cathedral. {nl}Around 150 will do, I'll give you a bag for them.
I wish there was a well flowing with the materials. {nl}It's my lifelong wish.
A Golem? That's strange. {nl}Maybe the goddess helped.{nl}
Done. Take it. {nl}Send my regards to the Archer Master.
I was just going to send you an errand. Sorry for the Golems. {nl}Anyway, I'll provide you my skills as promised.
I have no business with you. {nl}I'm busy. Go back.
You came to me to learn the skill of a ranger right? {nl}I'll consider it if you do me a favor.
I can't grasp what the Evoniphons are doing.{nl}I'm sure it's not something good but I can't even tell their objectives, it's making me mad.
So these must be the samples. These will be good enough for our trade. {nl}Alright, I'll help you become stronger.
You want to learn my skills? {nl}I'll think about it if you get me the tree I'm looking for.
The monsters are carrying grubby looking trees at Pretense Intersection.{nl}When you beat on them, some of them will make clear sounds. Bring those to me. 
Ah, that's right. Just throw it there somewhere. {nl}It's nothing difficult so I'll teach you, but if it disturbs my work, {nl}then I'll stop right away.
I don't know whether you would be able to follow even if you want to learn from me.{nl}I will give you an assignment. Find the monster I request and defeat it.
Keparis from the Starving Demon's Way, Kodomors from the Scattered Stairway and Dendens from the Purple Tree Fault Forest.{nl}Of course, I will give you bait.
Since you've done the mission well, I'll teach you about the Hunter's way. {nl}Good work.
If you dream to reach to a higher level as a Wugushi, I have an assignment for you.{nl}At the Grand Corridor of the Great Cathedral, collect the special poison from Stoulets.
The needle with the medicine that I mixed is in this tube.{nl}If you could hit Stoulets with this, you would be able to collect the poison.{nl}{nl}
It's hard to stray away from the charm of poison. I'm one of them. {nl}I'll let you know how appealing it is too. Let's start slowly from today on.
It is your assignment to find the hidden monsters.{nl}The location is the Purple Tree Forest.{nl}If you wish to be a Scout, you should be able to do this. Don't you think so?
No one can hide perfectly from the scouts. 
It was easier for you to do than I thought.{nl}Great. I think it'll be fun to teach you. {nl}Come to me anytime you want to learn from me.
I think you're good enough to be accepted as my disciple but you still need to be tested. {nl}I will welcome you if you bring the rubbings of Lydis Schaffen's gravestone in the Goddess' Ancient Garden.
It's the gravestone of the person that all archers look up to. {nl}Do it well so that all the writings are readable.
I used to be a Schaffenstar back in the day.{nl}Anyway, I will teach you my skills as promised.
Rogue Master
If you want to learn from me, you must be quick.{nl}At the grand corridor at the Great Cathedral, let's start off by surpassing 5 monsters with Smoke Bombs. 
Preternatural swiftness is the flower of the Rogues. {nl}The swift movement confuses your mind.
I thought it would be difficult but you're great at it. {nl}I will teach you the skills slowly so you better warm up first.
You need to show your bravery if you want to learn from me. {nl}Use this note to provoke the monsters at Penitence Route. {nl}
Are you brave enough to turn the enemy's blade to you when your allies are in danger?
I can picture them full of anger. {nl}You've passed the test. You're good enough to learn from me.
You want to learn from me? Then there's something you should do for me. {nl}Teach the Hackapell Master who believes that there's something in the world that can't be penetrated.
The spear is unbeatable and invincible. {nl}I want to see the face of poor Shadowgaler when it's defeated.
If that fellow asks, I'll proudly tell him that our skilled Hoplite took it down. {nl}I will acknowledge you with this.
You want to learn from me? {nl}Then you have to pass a test. {nl}
I heard the other Masters are sending their disciples to defeat Yekub in the Cathedral. {nl}But that is what you must bring an end to. Go now.
If you have the ability to learn from me, then Yekub will be easy enough.
I want to see their faces when they fight a Yekub that doesn't even exist. {nl}Alright, you're good enough.
You came here to learn the Formations of a Centurion?{nl}Then first I gotta find out if you're competent enough to command other people.
You can meet Colimencia when you go to the Layered Rock Forest.{nl}You must be competent enough to defeat it in order to become a Centurion.
You're welcome to become a Centurion. {nl}You'll learn step by step about the Centurion formation from now on.
Squires are strong but helping our partners is where we shine. {nl}Using the rope to make connecting attacks with fellow allies {nl}is an attack that is notably stronger than any other attacks.
This is an Arrest rope.{nl}Take this to the Sanctuary of the Great Cathedral and practice as much as you can so you are able to control it well.{nl}Let's talk about learning from me after that.
In order for connecting attacks to succeed, nobody can make any mistakes. {nl}That is why you need to practice hard.
How comfortable are you with it? {nl}I will teach you thoroughly as promised.
I heard the monster called Biteregina keeps threatening people at the Sunset Flag Forest.{nl}If you could defeat it, I will teach you my skills.
Since I am a Master, I should also help other people, but I just don't have enough time.{nl}Anyway, as I promised to you, I will teach you my skills.
Going through these dangers can be a good experience.
The Peltastas requested help. {nl}We have limited troops but we also can't reject the Peltastas as we have a pledge with them.
I want you to assist the Peltastas and carry out the mission.
We, the Peltastas, receive shield supplies as a condition for keeping our pledge with the Highlanders. {nl}The shields have always been delivered on time but recently the supplies have been cut. {nl}
Ask the Highlanders what the problem is and if you can, please solve it.
If you say so, there is a way.{nl}If you could defeat the Moas at Crystal Brook that destroyed my ingredients, I will shift your turn ahead.
I'm following the traces of Evoniphons.{nl}Recent information says that they tested something in the Cathedral.{nl}
Go to the Cathedral right away and get a sample of Moya's fluid. {nl}We'll should know something after examining it.
I'll give you this flare since you're a novice. {nl}It'll help you find the monsters efficiently.
Poison is a two-sided blade, so you should be careful with it. {nl}Especially if you get a finger cut while using poison..
I assume you've come to learn something from me because you have the ability. {nl}To win a duel against me.
Go to the vacant area above the stairs and wait. {nl}I'll be there after finishing this up.
You're faster than you look. {nl}I will teach you my skills from now on, so come anytime.
I heard the Minotaur showed up. {nl}If you want to learn from me, you should be able to hunt them down effortlessly.
If you didn't go, I would have gone myself. {nl}I'm giving the task to you, so you better be thankful for it.
Great. You have my recognition. {nl}Come by anytime if you want to learn the skills of the Hunters.
With your abilities, the Reaverpede in Lonesome Market should be easy to defeat. {nl}If you can't do that, I can't take you on as a Ranger apprentice.
I'm relieved you're here. {nl}Everyone is focused there but only us Rangers are not dispatched.
I heard you were a step faster than the Hunters. {nl}Good work. I'm a very strict teacher so you better be prepared.
Teaching you the skills of the Scouts isn't difficult. {nl}But you need to have the capability to follow it, don't you think?
Alright then. {nl}Deadborn appeared at Ruklys Road but the troops there need help. {nl}This should be fairly good hunting material.
Good job. You did better than I expected. {nl}Come by anytime if you want to learn something.
So you want to learn Sapper skills from me? That's a good idea. {nl}I'm currently lacking materials for a new trap.{nl}
So you will need to help me with it. {nl}You'll need to defeat the Rocktortuga at Ruklys Memorial and bring me Natural Mano Stones.
Rocktortugas at the Ruklys Memorial. {nl}The Rocktortugas in other areas don't give Mano Stones.
Alright. Got the Mano Stones..{nl}Come by anytime if you want to learn Sapper skills.
You said you want to learn my skills?{nl}If you could bring me some burnable stones from Yonazolems' central district, I'll think about it.
In other words, it's impossible.
You have unreasonably great skills. {nl}I'd welcome a disciple like you. I shall teach you my skills.
We enhance our immunity by experiencing lots of poisons.{nl}If you could survive from the poison of Rajatoad at the central district, then I will teach you how to control poisons as well.
Would it make sense if Wugushi is poisoned and weak?
Our teachings are harsh so I hope you understand. {nl}Anyway, you can come anytime if you want to learn.
I'm so ashamed of my disciples ruining all the commissions. {nl}If you do a good job, I will teach you the Quarrel Shooter skills.
It's the Templeshooter in Downtown. {nl} Even my disciples ran away when it was right in front of them, so prepare yourself for it.
You defeated it. Now I feel better. {nl}Come for lessons anytime. I'll teach you wholeheartedly.
Schwarzer Reiter Master
If you want to be a Schwarzer Reiter, then answer this question.{nl}If you want to survive intense battles, what will you need?{nl}
Allies? Support? Supply? No, a sword and a gun would be enough for me.{nl}They are the only things that I can trust.
And one more thing. Hatred for your enemies!{nl}If you wish to advance to Schwarzer Reiter, you should remember that hatred.{nl}
Because you won't be able to advance until you beat me.{nl}Come to me when you are prepared.
It seems that your luck has run out. {nl}Let's get started.
I feel like I am seeing my younger self in you. {nl}Now since you have become a Schwarzer Reiter, we are now mirrors to each other.
I need to test if you are qualified to learn my skills. {nl}Defeating Sparnashorn seems fair enough for someone like you, what do you think?
I heard Sparnashorn is huge, so it spends most of its time on the ground rather than in the air.
I didn't expect you to defeat it. That's pretty good. {nl}Alright. You can come anytime you want to learn skills.
I heard Minotaur have shown up at the Lonesome Marketplace.{nl}Please bring me the proof of your victory.
I don't know why, but from some point in time, lots of monsters started appearing from the petrified city.{nl}I heard other masters are having trouble because of that.
You want to reach a higher stage in life through the calling of Clerics. {nl}I will help you achieve it through service.
There are many people waiting for treatment, but there are not enough medicinal herbs. {nl}Please get Nicotia herbs from the Centurion Master in Pilgrim's Way.{nl}
It will be a long journey. {nl}May the blessings of goddess always be with you.
Ah, the Cleric Master sent you. {nl}Nice to meet you. I'm the Centurion Master.
Unfortunately, we're out of the Nicotia that the Cleric Master is asking for. {nl}There was an urgent request so it had to be used.
But don't worry. {nl}Nicotias grow all over the place so it'll be fine if you just take the young shoots.
Nicotia is not far away from here. {nl}Send my regards to the Cleric Master.
Thank you. This will help many people in pain. {nl}The goddess will also be glad that you reached a higher level of Cleric.
If you want to step up as a Krivis, then go and worship the goddess Statue in Fedimian. {nl}A pilgrimage is a sure way to fulfill duties to the goddess.
Take the offering before you leave. {nl}The Priest Master and Cleric Master will give you the offering needed for worship.
You're leaving for the pilgrimage. {nl}I can still remember pilgrimage when I was a young clergy.
You can feel your heart filling with faith when you look at the Goddess Statue in Fedimian.
I can give you the offerings.{nl}But before that, I have a favor to ask you. {nl}
Residents are complaining about the Rocktortuga running wild in Siauliai Western Woods. {nl}I will give you the offerings if you defeat that monster.
The goddess will also be happy for your mercy.{nl}Here, take the offerings. {nl}
The goddess will also be happy for your mercy.{nl}I also want to visit Fedimian again if I could.
You're going on a pilgrimage to Fedimian.{nl}Here, take the offerings.
The Goddess Statue is at the center of Fedimian. {nl}It's huge and wide so be careful not to get lost.
There's an interesting legend about the Goddess Statue in Fedimian. {nl}If you have the opportunity, it'll be good to see it too.
I can feel that you are full of the goddess' blessings. {nl}Good work. Those blessings will lead you to a higher place.
Are you coming from Fedimian? {nl}the Krivis Master is waiting for you.
Will you take on the vocation of Priest and follow the path of goddess? {nl}You can do so by getting rid of evil.
Evil forces are showing up in the Starving Demon's Way in Fedimian. {nl}Extract its identity from it and smudge it with the name of goddess.
Anyone who follows the words of the goddess can receive her powers to drive out evil spirits. {nl} But that strength will depend on the depth of one's faith.
Well done. {nl}In the name of the goddess, please judge the evil in this world so they are unable to get a foothold.
If you want to research about the way of Bokor, you should do something for me.{nl}Please get the jewel from the Krivis Master.
The Bokor Master sent you?{nl}So they have decided to dispose of that jewel.
It will be very dangerous.{nl}You should prepare yourself.
Take it. It is the jewel that is cursed by a vicious being.{nl}Several priests are trying to handle it, but they are having hard time.
Since we are also curious about that, please come back sometime later.
I have a bad feeling.{nl}I hope nothing bad occurs...{nl}
You've brought it.{nl}But...damn.
The curse in this jewel is calling Tutu here.{nl}While I figure out how to handle this curse, there is something that you should do.
First, tell the Krivis Master to prepare the memorial service.{nl}After that, please go to the East Siauliai Woods and block Tutu.
Something could happen when the power of the curse gets stronger.{nl}Our mission is to stop that.
Yes. In fact, that jewel is the one that a young priest from the village picked up.{nl}After he brought this jewel, he suffered from nightmares so I made a request to the Bokor Master.
Okay anyways. I will prepare the memorial service.{nl}Don't worry about it and just block Tutu from the East Siauliai Woods before it comes to Klaipeda.
These things happen because the world is in chaos.{nl}The goddess must feel sad about it...
I cleverly dealt with it because of your help.{nl}As a Bokor, I can expect you to grow from now on.
You defeated that Tutu. Well done.{nl}As a result, I can prepare the memorial service without any problem.{nl}
Return to the Bokor Master fast and tell her about it.
It's good that you are learning skills from me, but I want you to also understand the importance of caring after that.{nl}The priests in Klaipeda requested care for Goddess Statue, how about that?
I want you to get the perfumed oil used for maintaining the statue first.{nl}If you ask the priests, they will give it to you.
This is the perfumed oil.{nl}Since Tesla is too old, I was worried that my request may be too much, but I guess it's alright now.{nl}
This is all I have..{nl}I heard the Krivis Master also has some.
Perfumed Oil? Ah, here it is.{nl}Please take care of the statue.
Please tell Tesla that I am okay.
Meet the Priest Master too.{nl}The amount of perfumed oil you have may not be enough.
That's the task we entrusted to you, so if you need it we will give to you. {nl}Here you go.
Even if you receive perfumed oil from the Priest Master, it may not be enough.{nl}You should take great care with it.
The amount of perfumed oil you have seems a bit lacking.{nl}Since the Bokor Master also has some oil, why don't you go meet him?
Perfumed Oil? we will definitely give it to you.{nl}Tesla told us that he doesn't need any pay for that, so we felt sorry about it.
Too bad I can't go with you since I don't have enough time.
The statues that we entrusted to you are the statue in Fedimian and the statue in Klaipeda.{nl}Okay then, I am counting on you.
If you use the absolute power of the goddess, your journey to Fedimian should be a little easier.
Well done.{nl}Return to Tesla.
It is also a task of a Dievdirbys to take care of the work, not just the creation of the work.{nl}Don't forget about this feeling if you want to learn the skills of a Dievdirbys.{nl}{nl}Oh, you came back already. {nl}Well done. {nl}
It is also a task of a Dievdirbys to take care of the work, not just the creation of the work.{nl}Don't forget about this feeling if you want to learn the skills of a Dievdirbys.
The number of monsters increased a lot at Starving Demon's Way, and they are threatening the villagers there.{nl}If you want to step forward as a true Sadhu, then share your abilities.
Doing penance is not just for yourself, but to also be kind to others.
As you become kinder to others, you will reach a higher stage.{nl}As the Sadhu Master, I will lead the way for you.
First of all, a Paladin shows by acting rather than telling.{nl}Prove your religious belief of the goddess by dueling against me.
First of all, the religious belief is the power to us Paladins.{nl}You possess great religious belief.{nl}
You passed the test.{nl}You should be prepared for me to train your spirit harder from now on.
Monk Master
Your religious belief is affirmed when you have a well trained body.{nl}I will test you.
Good. Your religious belief is very strong.{nl}I will accept you as a monk. You should be prepared since our training is very hard.
Pardoner Master
Ordinarily, the best way to get accepted as a Pardoner is to contribute a lot of money.{nl}But, I think completing an assignment would be better for you.{nl}
Please bring me the fire pot.{nl}I heard a rumor that the merchants in Fedimian saw it.
Wow! Welcome.{nl}Do you need anything?
Fire pot? I saw it at Crystal Brook. {nl}The Pardoner Master was looking for it as well. I guess he couldn't find it.
Oh, the Pardoner Master. {nl}There's a lot he doesn't know...
Oh. Yes! This is it.{nl}I will accept you as a Pardoner.
Please return to the Pardoner Master.{nl}He was looking for the fire pot for a long time.
Fire Pot? Of course I know of it.{nl}But you know I am a merchant. If you could get me the hardened oil from the monsters at Starving Demon's Way...
If you don't need it, then I am okay with it.{nl}Since I am busy, I will just do my work.
Oh, Thank you.{nl}A monster called Mostem keeps his hands on the fire pot at all times.{nl}
Ask the equipment merchant over there, he said he saw it recently.
A Wizard is a magician who focus on the basics of all magic.{nl}If you seek a stronger magic, you should go back to the basics.{nl}
Please defeat the violent Golem at the West Siauliai Woods.{nl}I will decide whether I will continue to teach you based on your results.
Haha.{nl}I remember when you were a probationary wizard.
Yes. Well done.{nl}Let's start from the basics. I will help you to the best of my abilities.
The Poata are threatening the villagers at the East Siauliai Woods.{nl}If you could defeat those monsters in the name of the Goddess Gabija, I will teach you my magic.{nl}{nl}
One can say that he is stronger upon sharing knowledge with others after learning something.
Well done. The Goddess, Gabija, must be very satisfied.{nl}As promised, I will take you to the next stage of Pyromancer.
You dream to reach a higher stage with the power of chilly air.{nl}Mushcaria at the West Siauliai Woods will be a good assignment for you.
It's not good to see a weak human chasing after strength.
You did well without any faults.{nl}As promised, I will train you further.
A Psychokino shows his power by believing in his own abilities.{nl}You gotta show how much you trust yourself to receive my lessons.
The Red Vubbe Warriors in this forest are hard to fight against.{nl}But, if you trust yourself, you will be able to defeat them.
How are you going to use this super natural power if you don't trust yourself?{nl}Don't you think so?
Your abilities are way better than I expected.{nl}But, if you learn from me, you can reach a higher stage.
Before you learn magic from me, I want to see how you control mana.{nl}Defeat the Vubbe Warrior at the West Siauliai Woods using any magic you want.
As you know more about a Linker, it is very interesting.{nl}Don't you think so? Reading the string of mana...
You possess great abilities indeed.{nl}As a Linker, if I can lead you well, you will become a really powerful magician.
Before you learn the magic of a Thaumaturge, I need to test your magical skills.{nl}Defeat the Burning Salamanders at the Mage Tower.
It is important to measure your skill.{nl}It will be more important if you don't pass the test.
This is nice.{nl}I will help with my best efforts for your future development.{nl}{nl}
Instead of bragging about yourself in words, it's much better to show others that you are competent.{nl}I will give you a test. Defeat slimy Reaverpede at the Remaining Tree Dale.
The Reaverpede at the Remaining Tree Dale would be a good fit for your reputation.{nl}I've heard about you enough, but I should check with my own eyes.
Very nice.{nl}You have obtained the right to become stronger with this.{nl}
You had better give up if your will is not strong enough.{nl}If that's not the case, defeat the Devilglove that is around here.
Evil spirits are just tools.{nl}I will not do anything that would turn my back on the goddess.
You really use every possible means.{nl}Well, we are the same about that. I will permit you to learn magic from me.
I have prepared something nice down there for someone who would become my disciple.{nl}From there, pick up some corpse fragments. 
Being a Necromancer is really nice.{nl}But, using humans as ingredients is absolutely forbidden.
Very nice indeed.{nl}You have no problem understanding my spells.
Chronomancer Master
If you want to learn my magic, I should first understand your skills.{nl}Defeating Reaverpede at the Remaining Tree Dale should be enough.
No matter how strong a magic is, it can not stop time from flowing.{nl}But, it could be possible if it were Agailla Flurry's work...
You did way better than I expected.{nl}I will acknowledge your skills. Please follow my teachings closely from now on.
I don't know if those Masters really think about the safety of the goddess and the kingdom.{nl}Ironbaum is approaching Klaipeda, but no one is worried about it.
That attitude is what I wanted.{nl}I will teach you the true magic if you defeat Ironbaum at the West Siauliai Woods.
Especially the attitude of the Cryomancer Master really...pisses me off.
I remember when you first arrived in Klaipeda.{nl}If you want, you can start the training right away.
Ironbaum is running around the East Siauliai Woods rignt now.{nl}But, the Chronomancer Master is not doing anything about it.{nl}
I know it is little ridiculous to ask a favor to a person whom has come to learn my magic, but I have no other choice.{nl}I want you to defeat Ironbaum to teach him a lesson.
Klaipeda may fall into danger, but he only cares about his safety. That's pathetic.
Well done.{nl}The Cryomancer Master woudn't stand and watch now since the Pyromancer trainee also stepped forward.{nl}Until then, let's talk about fire magic in detail.
The other masters are all blaming me.{nl}They told me that I am not doing anything even when those monsters are threatening Klaipeda.{nl}
Do I have to face against those weak monsters?{nl}If you can take care of them, I will teach you the magic of the Choronomancer.
It's called Ironbaum and it is located at the West Siauliai Woods.{nl}Even if I am not interested in it, I can't help listening since I am not deaf.
I wonder what the Pyromancer Master would think when looking at the defeated Ironbaum.{nl}I will teach you the magic of Chronomancer as I promised.
I have a request that I don't want to lose to the Linker Master.{nl}If you could take care of that request on behalf of me, I will teach you how to control your energy. How about it?
It is not that hard.{nl}You just have to defeat the Werewolf that is walking around this mine village.
I had troubles with that a few times in the past.{nl}But if I have a disciple like you, I won't lose to the Linker Master anymore.
That's nice!{nl}Leave the Linker Master and let's talk about energy in details.
If you want to learn about my magic, there is something that you should do for me.{nl}Defeat the Werewolf that appeared in the Miners' Village quicker than the Psychokino Master.
The Werewolf is not easy, but you will be able to defeat it.{nl}You applied to become a Linker right?
Well done. I wonder what the Psychokino Master will feel after looking at the defeated Werewolf.{nl}I will teach you my magic as I promised to you.
Monsters are causing chaos near Fedimian.{nl}As a result, the masters are working together to defeat them.{nl}How about it, if you are an applicant to become a Thaumaturge, I think you should also help.
Oh, that's very brave of you! {nl}Defeat the Netherbovine at Faultline, and then I will advance you when you return.
Good. You are qualified as a Thaumaturge.{nl}As I promised, I will advance you.
All the masters in Fedimian are chasing after the monsters that are causing chaos.{nl}You should defeat those monsters before anybody to learn my magic.
The monster is called Netherbovine. {nl}According to a reliable source, it appeared at Faultline recently.
I can still picture the faces of the other masters.{nl}Not only that, I am also happy to get a good disciple.
It doesn't make sense to stay in a safe place as a master when there are hordes of monsters.{nl}I thought that wasn't right so I ran from Fedimian.{nl}
I heard that Necroventer appeared again at the old garden of the goddess.{nl}If you dream to be a sorcerer, I hope you follow my request.
It is silly to stay in a safe place as a master.{nl}
I understand your point.{nl}I will teach you magic as I had promised.
I can teach you my magic whenever you want.{nl}But, I am not sure if you can follow my lead well.
If that's the case, please defeat Necroventer that appeared at the old garden of the goddess.{nl}I can teach you my magic when you can do that.
You are better than I expected.{nl}But, the magic to control time is really difficult so you should be prepared.
Long time no see. You want to be an Alchemist.{nl}I should test if you are worthy enough to be an Alchemist.
Good.{nl}Please defeat the Werewolf that is making a mess around here.{nl}
It is not hard to learn the knowledge of an Alchemmist.{nl}You can learn the basics, such as decomposition of an element and synthesis, slowly.
Good. I am looking forward to your future.{nl}I will advance you to Alchemist.
You should prove your determination to remove evil in order to follow the training of a priest.{nl}Please get pouches imbued with Magi from the Vubbes at the 1st Floor of the Crystal Mine.
Please talk to the elder of the Crystal Mine if you have a hard time entering the Crystal Mine.
I will purify these pockets so that they won't release demonic power anymore.{nl}Brother, I welcome you to be a priest.
Brother. You came far to learn the religious belief of a Krivis, but I don't have the time to greet you at the moment.
One of our brothers who was bringing back a sacred relic has disappeared.{nl}I've been praying for the mercy of the goddess. Can you find our brother?
Krivis Brother
Don't come near!{nl}The monsters that are after the sacred relic are coming!
I was so afraid that I would not be able to bring the sacred relic to Klaipeda.{nl}Brother, you must be a messenger that the goddess sent.
The last call stopped at the Crystal Mine.{nl}The brother should be safe...I am so worried.
I have a lot more to do.{nl}Don't worry, please pass this sacred relic to the Krivis Master.
How can I say that this object is more important than a person.{nl}This is all due to the blessing of the goddess that our brother is safe.{nl}
Anyway, we welcome you to be a member of the Krivis.{nl}The goddess must be happy to see you.
You should prove that you are suited to use a sword if you want to reach a higher level of swordsmanship.{nl}Please obtain the heart of Stone Orca at the 1st Floor of the Crystal Mine.
There is nothing more important than life.{nl}If you want to use a sword, you should be determined.
Okay that's it...you collected it well.{nl}I will teach you how to become a person suited to use swords.
Magic can't make a distinguished person, as I don't like a lazy person.{nl}Defeat Shredded at the 1st Floor of the Crystal Mine.
If you don't train yourself well, I won't accept you as a Wizard.{nl}Learn something a hundred times and train a thousand times to become a real Wizard.
I understand your determination.{nl}I will teach you well so that you can become a person well suited for wizardry.
You want to learn my skills?{nl}It's not hard to teach, but would you be able to master my lesson?
If you cannot bring arrows, you better give up now.
Okay, you have passed.{nl}I will teach you to become a talented archer.
Clerics help others to reach a higher stage.{nl}To cure other people, please get me the green ointment from the Vubbes at the 1st Floor of the Crystal Mine.{nl}{nl}
The goddess told me to help you.{nl}By helping others near you, you will help your spirit as well.
I think I can relieve the pains of many patients with this.{nl}As a Cleric Master, I will help you contribute more to the goddess.
Defeat the bats at the 1st Floor of the Crystal Mine and bring me their wings as proof.
If you can give us the blessing of the cure, you will become even closer to the goddess.{nl}By helping others, I will help you reach a higher stage of Cleric.
Lots of people come here after receiving injuries from monsters.{nl}But since I ran out of herbs, we have no choice but to only give first aid to the patients.
Thanks.{nl}As a Cleric Master, I will help you accomplish a higher mission.
The number of people who are hurt due to monster attacks keep increasing, but we don't have enough herbs.{nl}Please bring wild flower alcohol from the Lonesome Marketplace for them.
{nl}Maybe I can help you, but you must know what real battle feels like before you receive lessons from me.{nl}
You can find the Honeypin at Deep Indigo Forest.{nl}They will be a good challenge for you at the moment.
You should train hard and experience real battle, but do not forget the word careful.
Good. I can see that you are much better now.{nl}If you want to learn, please come often.
Your heroic stories are good lessons for us Peltastas.{nl}But, I should check you myself before accepting you as my disciple.
Stories are always exaggerated.{nl}So forgive me for acting so picky.
It was not an exaggeration.{nl}Since your skill has been proven, I will accept you into learning the lessons of a Peltasta.
The only thing you can trust in real battles is your experience.{nl}If you want to learn the swordsmanship of a Highlander, it will be good to accumulate more experience.
There is a monster called Honeypin at Deep Indigo Forest.{nl}Facing that monster will be a good experience for you.
Well done.{nl}You will become a good swordsman if you gain more experience and learn from me.
To be called a Hoplite, You should act in such a way that everyone can trust and rely on you.{nl}Your skills are already famous here, but I want to check them with my own eyes.
There's a monster called Colimencia at the Layered Rock Forest. {nl}It is a threatening monster, but you should defeat it easily.
I thought this would take you more time, you are better than I thought.{nl}I am counting on you as a colleague.
It is strange that a skillful person like you would learn from me.{nl}But, there is a cost to any learning.
I heard the Poata at the Layered Rock Forest attack people.{nl}It would be more than enough if you could defeat them.
So I guess it was dealt with easily.{nl}Good. You are qualified.{nl}
If you want to learn from me, you must first show me your skills.{nl}I think defeating Colimencia at the Layered Rock Forest would be more than enough.
You should become strong to become an example for others. Don't you think so?
Good. You skills are enough.{nl}I am happy to teach you.
If you want to be a Cataphract, you should be able to defeat Gaigalas at the Flowerless Forest.{nl}Come back after defeating it.
There has been nothing that could obstruct my path since I decided to become a Catapract. {nl}Just peirce through anything that would block us. Don't you think so?
You are more than I expected.{nl}Good. Let's continue our good relationship.
I am sorry, but I am too busy to accept you at the moment.{nl}I heard someone saw our family's symbol, which was lost on Medzio Diena, so I am looking for it.
I am the only one left in the Legwyn family, so each symbol is important to me.
This... is the symbol of the Legwyn family.{nl}Thank you. As I promised you, I will help you reach a higher level.
If you want to learn from me, it is courtesy to show your own skills first. {nl}Defeating the Honeypin at Deep Indigo Forest would be enough. 
For me, the life of a pirate is fighting, stealing, fighting again, and stealing again.{nl}My fellows, drink up!
Very reliable.{nl}Good. I will teach you my skills from now on.
If you want to learn something from me, defeat Gaigalas at the Flowerless Forest.{nl}If you want to be acknowledged in terms of both your determination and skills.{nl}{nl}
This is a very dangerous request that other masters feel uncomfortable with.{nl}If you want more, you should accept more dangerous requests.
I will recognize your skills as promised. {nl}Follow me. I will open the way of the Doppelsoeldner for you.
I will check your skills by seeing whether or not you are able to defeat Gaigalas at the Flowerless Forest. {nl}I wish you the best of luck.
... I guess there's no other way. I think I will be able to test you with this.{nl}I heard there's a person who saw Poata swallowing the crest in the Layered Rock Forest.{nl}Okay then, I am counting on you.
I lost an important sacred relic of the Krivis.{nl}If you want to reach a higher stage of Krivis, I will help you find the sacred relic again.
There is a strong power within the sacred relic so lots of monsters are pursuing it for themselves.{nl}Losing a sacred relic is like losing your faith.
Well done. Fortunately, the sacred relic is okay.{nl}I will teach you the training of a Krivis as I promised you.
I hear that a vicious aura has been coming from Ruklys Street lately.{nl}If you want to walk the way of a Priest, you should exorcise it in the name of the goddess.
The vicious aura is really evil.{nl}But I am sure you will be able to exorcise the energy at Ruklys Street.
This is an important sacred relic that was being transferred to Klaipeda.{nl}I heard that they were attacked while they were walking on the main street of the Petrified City.{nl}I am counting on you.
I am sorry, but the way of Bokor can't be explored by just anyone.{nl}If you could bring me the essence of the petrified whale that appears at Lonesome Marketplace, I will acknowledge your skill.
The petrified whale at Lonesome Marketplace has taken many lives.{nl}I need the essence that has the resentment from them in it.
Well done.{nl}I will teach you everything about Bokor as promised.
If I could obtain solid wood from the main street of Petrified City, I would be able to accept any request...{nl}For example, the lesson of Dievdirbys.
That is my lifelong wish.{nl}That tree always gestures towards me to make itself into a masterpiece.
Oh. That's it.{nl}You can come to me anytime you want to learn the lessons of a Dievdirbys!
There is a rumor that many people who have crossed Ruklys Street are suffering from nightmares.{nl}If you want to walk the way of Sadhu, you shall help them.
When you eliminate the source, the nightmares will be gone.{nl}Please go to Ruklys Street and eliminate the source.
You have done a good job.{nl}I'm looking forward to your growth as a Sadhu.
I heard enough about you, that you have a firm religious belief.{nl}But I want to check it with my own eyes.
Forgive me. I am being picky since this task is in the name of Paladin.{nl}I think defeating Rajapearl at the Lonesome Marketplace would be enough to prove yourself, given your reputation.
Prove your religious belief.{nl}There's nothing to be worried about. The goddess will protect you.
You have done well.{nl}With this, your religious belief is proven, so I will accept you to learn my lessons.
A Monk's training is very strict.{nl}If you still want to receive training, go to the central district and defeat Repus, and bring its toe nails.{nl}If you can do that, I will acknowledge you.
Our training is very harsh. {nl}You should at least defeat Repus at the central district to follow our training.
Good. I will accept your determination.{nl}I always tell you, but our Monk training is really harsh.
Insteand of an entrance test for Pardoner, there's something you should do for me. {nl}Please find the lost money of indulgence at Ruklys street. You can do it right?
I heard he lost it at Ruklys street so go there and find it.
At the moment when I didn't know what to do, the goddess sent you.{nl}Anyways, I congratulate you in becoming a Pardoner.
Oracle Master
Even when the goddess is absent, an Oracle should pass along the oracle competently.{nl}I will test whether you are qualified to do it by dueling against you.
I checked your competence well enough.{nl}As an Oracle Master, I will help you interpret the oracle well.
Are you ready?{nl}I will see you under the stairs.

{S35} {nl} The Fletcher Master and Lydia Schaffen {/}
Even if someone becomes the world's greatest archer, consumption of arrows will always be a problem. {nl} Lydia Schaffen's bow was used with great care. However, Schaffen too, uses arrows. {nl} But unlike fired arrows, Her bow is permanent even with continued use.  {nl}
Even if it was impossible to create arrows that can be used permanently, Lydia Schaffen delved into arrow crafting techniques. {nl} Obtaining materials neccesary to craft arrows was another problem. {nl}
Troubled greatly by this problem, Lydia Schaffen went on a journey to find the solution. {nl} Whether or not she had been granted blessing by the goddess when she met the Fletcher Master or if she found the solution to her problem, Historians will continue to debate about the topic. {nl}
Many Fletchers had been produced ever since the dawn of time. But talentless numbers are irrelevant. {nl} People just call him the Fletcher Master, Lydia Schaffen too,was uncertain of his name. {nl}
Ever since his rise to fame, People called him the Fletcher Master. People who knew his real name were swept away by the passings of the river of time. {nl} His real name, according to some scholars, was said to be John Blacksmith. but the name itself isn't getting any credibility, since you cannot readily accept a famous name that common. {nl}
Anyway, Lydia Schaffen met this the Fletcher Master who was an arrow expert. Lydia after overcoming her journey, was ready to learn. {nl} However, arrow crafting techniques by the Fletcher Master was a secret at that time, and in the years afterwards, a stuff among legends. {nl}
However, even if you are the world's greatest archer, the goddess' blessing is important to learn the arrow crafting techniques of the Fletcher Master. {nl} Therefore only someone who has the blessing of the goddess can be molded to create a the Fletcher Master, like how Lydia Schaffen created new and consistent arrows. {nl}
Another tale is of the Fletcher Master's secret to avoid combat according to the maker's manual is to hit with certainty somewhere in the spleen. {nl}
The rapid production of arrows by the Fletcher Master is regarded to be his sole talent. However he may have a secret lying in wait somewhere in this world. {nl}
Lydia Schaffen Crossroads
{S35} {nl} Lydia Schaffen Crossroads {/}
This is a record to the Royal Family about a story when King Kadumel asked Lydia Schaffen whether she can hit a target behind a boulder or a tree, and how she simply answered the King with the crisp sound of her arrow hitting the target. However, there are some written inconsistencies from the royal record and the folklore. That is, King Kadumel noted at the time, he was not giving Schaffen a test of her abilities with a bow.
A more important fact is what sort of target Lydia Schaffen hit. Or to put it more precisely, who she hit, would be of great significance.{nl}Whenever the royal records and the folklore handle this story, they do not reference the time when it arose.{nl}
Both versions simply introduce the heroic story by focusing on Lydia Schaffen's great bow skills.{nl}There is a certain reason for this.{nl} The reason is that this story happened in the final days of the Civil War. Differing from the known folklore, Ruklys was not killed by King Kadumel's soldiers in the last layer of the Fortress of the Land. It is said that Ruklys had a particular reason for not letting any outsiders into the heart of his fort.{nl}
Rather than dying, Ruklys escaped moments before his fort was overrun, and King Kadumel ordered his soldiers to go pursue him.{nl} After the pursuit, Ruklys found himself cornered at the edge of a cliff.
There was a large enough rock on the cliff for Ruklys to put his back against while facing the cliff and keeping the King's soldiers at the opposite face of the rock.{nl} Ruklys leaned his back on the rock so the King's archer who tracked him could not attack.{nl} If it were a different location they could have gone to the left and right to surround and rain arrows, but the cliff, alongside the battle formation, was not a place for such attacks.{nl}
Having no archers who could shoot across the air beyond the cliff, King Kadumel unquestionably drove his soldiers towards the edge of the cliff.{nl}
However Ruklys and his remaining men repelled the King's soldiers, showing their inhuman ability to persist day and night. This even caused the King's peasant soldiers to begin to waver.{nl} Furthermore, Ruklys' heroic struggle made such an impression to some of Kadumel's men and officers, that some started questioning Kadumel's command.{nl} Already unpopular among people under his rule, King Kadumel could not continue pushing his men to their death, he also could not wait until Ruklys died of hunger or fatigue.{nl}
And through this situation, King Kadumel asked a clever question to Lydia Schaffen.{nl}  Of course, Lydia did not take King Kadumel's provocation as a chance to show her skills and fire a meek high angle shot to kill Ruklys. There were other reasons that were overlapping here.
But considering these reasons, in any case, such as having her master's wishes, or the thought that she ended someone's life through her own hands, we as the current generation can only guess how hurt and conflicted were Lydia Schaffen's emotions. Henceforth, people became knowledgeable of the time when Lydia Schaffen easily pierced a target behind a boulder from the crossroads, however, Lydia would bear an immeasurable complex emotion about the crossroads from that day forward.
Lydia Schaffen's Notch
{s35}{nl}Lydia Schaffen's Notch{/}
This story is said to have taken place one day at the Astral Tower.{nl}A dispute among the disciples of Lydia Schaffen broke out.{nl}Several disciples gathered after the training and in the process such a dialogue is said to have come up: 'No matter how good your bow is, if your skills are lacking, you can't bring out its full potential. Therefore, what is important in the end is your own skill.'{nl}Such was a claim of a certain disciple, which started the dispute.{nl}
'You are forgetting the basics of archery. What is an archer? It is someone who uses a tool called a bow, right?{nl}Do you think an archer existing without a bow is possible? {nl}Even if one gets famous for their skill with sword and spear, can one still call themselves an archer? In the end, archery is the concept of depending on tools, isn't it?'{nl}
The disciple who had a different view argued back:{nl}'You said tools are important, let's talk about that.{nl}What is a bow? There are various weapons for an archer. Just like there are weapons that don't need much skill to handle, like a crossbow, there are also weapons, effectiveness of which varies a lot based on a user's skill, like the ones of the Wugushi.{nl}The Wind Arrow of the Wugushi is hard to master, it's a difficult weapon to wield for someone without experience, no matter how good the materials of one's bow are.{nl}
However, calling a catapult or a crossbow a weapon anyone can handle is not correct.{nl}You claim archery exists solely because there are tools, this is wrong.
This is the same as saying that since people will die if they don't eat, their lives are less important than food and depend on it.{nl}Are you claiming that since you eat to be able to live on, you are living to eat?'{nl}Upon that, another disciple shared his viewpoint:{nl}'You are arguing about the path of the Archer, but you are only concentrating on one aspect.{nl}What you fail to address is that no matter how famous an archer one is, no matter how eagle-eyed one is, what they are using to their advantage is the wind. {nl}
The arrow could not be shot if it wasn't for the wind and air that carries it to the mark, how could any sharpshooter exist, or rather, how much would an archer be able to do in that case? In the end, what is necessary for an archer is to sense the wind flow and to be able to act on it.'{nl}
From then on, the disciples argued to no end, claims became more diverse and interesting, theories fired back and forth.{nl}Finally, they started wondering about what their master, Lydia Schaffen, would think of this.{nl}After having told her about the discussion they've had so far, they waited for her reply.{nl}
When the disciples came to Lydia Schaffen, she is said to have been eating chestnuts using an arrowhead, dangerously perched on the railing of the Astral Tower.{nl}
Lydia Schaffen continued eating while listening to the disciples, keeping her position on the railing. After they finished, she kept quiet for a while, but before long she fiddled with her fingers through the pile of shells of chestnuts she had eaten and picked out something, reportedly saying this: {nl}'What is this?'{nl}The disciple with the sharp eyes answered before anyone could.{nl}'It's the inner skin of a chestnut.'{nl}
It was very obvious that it was indeed the inner skin of a chestnut, so the others nodded in agreement and waited for their master's next words. {nl}And so Lydia Schaffen continued. {nl}'No. This is the notch of my arrow.'{nl}
Having said so, she pinched the inner skin of a chestnut between her fingers, took her bow that was lying beside her as always and fired into the sky using the inner skin as a notch. {nl}It is said that Lydia Schaffen has settled the dispute of the disciples that way, jumped from the railing she was sitting on and left, leaving the disciples bewildered.{nl}
Lydia Schaffen and Rumpelstiltskin 
{s35}Lydia Schaffen and Rumpelstiltskin {/} 
This is a story about Lydia Schaffen that has been handed down throughout the Kingdom. {nl}Furthermore, while there are places that Lydia Schaffen has never been to according to historical records, there are stories about what happened when she visited their village.{nl}These stories contain absurd things such as dragons appearing, a strange demon which is different from the demon we know laying a wager with Lydia Schaffen.{nl}
In spite of that, the villagers from the region believe the story beyond doubt, and they embrace the pride that this story about Lydia Schaffen brings, having originated from their hometown.{nl}
Compared to Ruklys, who likely died early on during the Civil War, or Flurry, who rarely left the tower she built, Lydia Schaffen definitely went on a greater number of adventures around the world, making her the most suitable as the protagonist of a story.{nl}This is one of those stories.{nl}
It is not known how true the story really is. Perhaps it was just as absurd in the past as it would definitely be absurd in the present. Still, the fact that it is still told today means the story agrees with the nature of Lydia Schaffen.
One day Lydia Schaffen left a certain village alone and walked around at night.{nl} Lydia Schaffen saw a traveler sitting wearily at the roadside on a woodland road. {nl} Out of curiosity, she decided to approach him.{nl} 'Why are you sitting here in the forest in the middle of the night?'{nl}The traveler was hesitant to answer at first, but after being asked multiple times he finally opened his mouth. {nl}The reason was apparently this: {nl}
The traveler had met a demon named Rumpelstiltskin when passing through the forest several days ago. {nl}Then he was lured into playing a game with the demon. {nl}
The reward for winning the game was significant, but the game with the demon was not easy. In the end, the traveler lost to Rumpelstiltskin. {nl}The traveler kept sighing as he waited for Rumpelstiltskin to come back. {nl} After hearing the traveler's story, Lydia Schaffen decided to confront the demon. She promised to the traveler that she'll help him with all her might. Some time passed, and Rumpelstiltskin appeared.
Lydia offered Rumpelstiltskin to let the traveler go and play a game with her in exchange. {nl}For better or for worse, Rumpelstiltskin was well aware of Lydia Schaffen's reputation, and the fact that she requested a game with him excited him into accepting her request. {nl}
In the past, Rumpelstiltskin was quite famous for challenging his opponents to use their best skill and then defeating them. {nl} But, he changed the rules of his game a bit every time. {nl} Lydia Schaffen asked: 'I understand that you want to challenge my archery skill, so what are we going to do?'{nl}
'Of course, a game to see who is better with a bow would not be that interesting. Therefore, let's play a game where you fire an arrow at a target, and then I will try to catch and ride the arrow before it reaches the target,' said Rumpelstiltskin. {nl}Lydia replied, questioning the proposal: 'Ride an arrow?'{nl}'That is correct,' averred Rumpelstiltskin.{nl}
Upon answering, Rumpelstiltskin started to shrink his body.{nl} Once he had reduced himself to the size of a child's fist, Rumpelstiltskin spoke: 'Well, this size will allow me to ride your arrow, right?'{nl}Lydia Schaffen thought for a bit,{nl}'There is a problem with that, though. If you touch the arrow and cause it to fall to the ground without it ever hitting the target, then wouldn't that still be a loss for me regardless of whether you rode the arrow or not?'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin answered her with these words.{nl}
'Then how about this. I win if I can ride your arrow until it reaches the target.'{nl} 'And if your arrow falls to the ground,' he continued, 'then we both lose.'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin added, 'The game shall have three rounds, best two out of three.'{nl}
After Rumpelstiltskin's seemingly honest answer, Lydia Schaffen replied, 'Alright, one more thing: I'm going to shoot at any target, in any direction. I'll tell you what the target is each round. This way, you won't be able to get used to it for rounds two and three. Are you okay with this?{nl}'Alright, let's do that,' agreed Rumpelstiltskin. {nl}After also agreeing upon terms of defeat, the game between two people, err, one person and one demon began.{nl}
Lydia Schaffen weighed her arrow, then called out the first target:{nl}'The tallest brown tree over there!'{nl}With those words, she released the arrow and it sliced through the air at a frightful speed{nl}
Rumpelstiltskin moved nimbly to chase the flying arrow, and after he got on, the arrow impaled the tree. As the arrow continued to oscillate, he danced to the rhythm of the oscillation and sang an unknown tune.{nl}Lydia Schaffen again gauged her arrows, then she called:{nl}'All of the cones on that pine tree on my front-left side!'{nl}Upon calling the target, Lydia Schaffen unleashed her godlike archery skills. 
Her arrows poured faster than heavy rain during a hot summer day, as if hundreds, or even thousands of arrows were fired at the same time in the same direction. {nl}
Rumpelstiltskin couldn't take it as calmly this round. Faster than the human eye could distinguish, Rumpelstiltskin landed on each arrow one by one and transferred to another as the barrage cut through the air. In the end, he was able to get onto the last arrow before it reached the last pine cone.{nl}Rumpelstiltskin spoke to Lydia Schaffen while trying to catch his breath.{nl}
'So there, I managed to sit on every single arrow before the last arrow reached the target. I win.'{nl} Lydia Schaffen replied,{nl}' Certainly, I can't deny the fact you sat on every arrow before the last one reached its target.'{nl}
Rumpelstiltskin gave a wicked grin after hearing Lydia Schaffen's words and said,{nl}'Meaning, I won this game. Now, as for the penalty we agreed on...'{nl}Before Rumpelstiltskin could finish, Lydia Schaffen shook her head and spoke,{nl}'Don't tell me that because you won two rounds, you won't play the final round? It's not acceptable, we clearly promised to play three rounds anyway, didn't we?'{nl}
'The game doesn't end before the third round, so I think it's pointless to talk about penalties before the game has actually ended...'{nl}
Recognizing that he has already won two rounds and had no reason to refuse a third, as well as the fact the game was certainly not over yet, Rumpelstiltskin had no choice but to abide by Lydia Schaffen's words.{nl}And so the final round began, Lydia Schaffen gauged her last arrow, and called out as she pulled the bowstring back:{nl}'My target is... the moon in the sky!'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin side-saddled the arrow as soon as it left the bowstring, and not before long, he realized what he heard.
And, as he rode the arrow towards the moon, Rumpelstiltskin also realized the fact that the game couldn't end until he reached it.{nl}As time passed, the power of the arrow subsided and it began falling towards the ground. However, after a time the arrow that Rumpelstiltskin rode on stopped still, floating in the sky.{nl}
Just as Rumpelstiltskin, grinding his teeth, was about to open his mouth, Lydia Schaffen said,{nl}'For the game to end, you need to ride the arrow until it arrives at its target. The game cannot end before then. If you manage to touched the moon and come back, then I will definitely accept the penalty.'{nl}Having said so, Lydia Schaffen began walking away as Rumpelstiltskin watched, grinding his teeth once again, unable to change the course of the game.
According to the anecdote, Rumpelstiltskin has not reached the moon yet, and is still flying there using the magic in his body. {nl}One can only guess if he will manage to return before his demonic life span ends.
Nevertheless, as we know, Lydia Schaffen has passed away long ago. So while the demon did not lose the game, he has lost his chance to win the game forever. {nl}Still, the one matter left that we, as the current generation, are curious about is what the agreed penalty between Lydia Schaffen and Rumpelstiltskin was. {nl}Of course, we could ask a particular person, err, demon, that may or may not still be alive. However, as we do not know when he will return, it will be hard to settle this lingering matter for quite some time.{nl}
The Expansion of Atman
The Expansion of Atman
Congratulations on receiving this book, which no criminal may see. There are many ways to use magic, but the magic used by Linkers are a particular case. Other mages exercise effect-based powers rather than magic. That is to say, to fight an enemy with a fireball, or with lightning, does not truly bind the enemy with magic. 
These attacks only use magic to make a fireball and lightning. Then, the mages control the magical energy's direction and destination, releasing it after settling on both.
In other words, these mages are unable to handle enemies without Linkers; as they need to channel and regulate surrounding energy, these mages do not have the time to easily handle targeting their magic towards an enemy. However, as you have chosen to walk the path of the Linker, the way of your magic will differ completely. The way of a Linker's magic is by directly linking your magic with your opponent's magic, which includes searching for your target within seconds.
Also, in the case of linking more than 2 targets, a Linker's way of magic is complicated even further if the targets have mutually opposing properties. In these situations, the Linker must use a viable magical property to connect the targets with opposing properties.
Thus to some extent, the Linkers are experienced magic users who still have a lot of new fields to test. Even if there are those predestined to be Linkers, fledging mages who have developed their abilities to control magic are recommended becoming Linkers and walking the path of a Linker. Above all, the most important matter about Linkers is the establishment of their truly resolved soul, or Atman. Without it, it is possible for attacks directed at a magically linked target to return towards the Linker.
For this reason, Linkers differ from other mages in which they must remember to use their magically established self as a tool. Particularly, when you must face other Linkers, your Atman is even more important.
Congratulations again on receiving this book. The fact that you were able to find this book means that you have successfully found some sort of link between the visible world and the invisible world. Consequently, if you experience difficulty searching for a magical linkage point within a group of targets hereafter, it'll become easier to cast away insincerity.
Armor from the Kadumel Era
Armor from the Kadumel Era{/}
{nl}{nl}Vados Winterspoon
{nl}{nl}10 years have passed since I began my research. Now, exactly 30 years after the Civil War, I finally have results to show.{nl}Although the purpose of this research is to satisfy my small curiosity, if the scope were to be broadened, it may prove beneficial to the Winterspoon family.{nl}
Anyway, after spending a long time searching every nook and cranny for information about Ruklys and his followers, I reached a conclusion.{nl}*These notes were compiled after the... from King Kadumel's men..., on the assumption that there are no contradictions.*{nl}During the period when the Civil War took place, there weren't any significant differences between the King's army and rebel army.
Both sides had armaments of comparable quality.{nl} King Kadumel's army outnumbered the rebel army, but the Fortress of the Land and its surrounding city (now called Petrified City) was a favourable position to be situated in.
Many of the attackers had to attack through a funnel, is my conclusion.{nl}These tactics reduced the numerical advantage from 10-to-1 to 3-to-1. *Ruklys intended to make a heroic defense in the Fortress of the Land*, The likelihood of victory is not great, even with 20 times the amount of troops. A theory commonly accepted by military scholars.{nl}
King Kadumel had a numerical advantage in troops, but other factors involved are just as important.{nl}A significant difference, for example, is how wars are fought now compared to a thousand years ago.
There have been many advances in military science, but the changes created by the development of the magical academy is incomparable. Warfare with magicians as combatants add a lot more elements for commanders to consider.
This was the key difference between the armies of Ruklys and King Kadumel.{nl}
If one side had magicians whereas the other side did not, the difference between troops and equipment is meaningless. It is estimated that the number of magicians in King Kadumel's army was substantial.{nl}
*Although Ruklys' mentor was against fighting an army that has a considerable number of magicians, the war could not be avoided.*
Typically, the number of soldiers and their equipment greatly influences the tide of battle; however, with the inclusion of magicians, such was not the case as it turns out during the civil war.
This phenomenon creates some issues to how the past was analyzed. If King Kadumel had not properly utilized the magicians, then it would be his folly and incompetence. As for the exceptional bravery Ruklys demonstrated, there may be another explanation to it.{nl}
The perspectives like those are not all invalid. However, one thing must be said about the result of this research. That is the metal Ruklys and his followers used for their armor.
The purpose of the research is to examine why magic was not effective in the battle against Ruklys and his followers.{nl}
In other words, it's a possibility that Ruklys' forces were armed with Mana Metal powerful enough to negate the magical attacks of magicians.{nl}At first, this may sound absurd.
The fact that a metal, Mana Metal, with such high resistance against magic exists is strange, but if such a metal does exist, then there couldn't have been enough to make more than one set of armor. The commander, Ruklys, would have been the only one wearing such an armor, otherwise it wouldn't make sense if the Mana Metal were distributed to that many of his troops.{nl}It is just as reasonable that the opposite was true.
If one were to write about this, he/she can think of an objection to this immediately.{nl}In order to support this claim, one would need to find evidence of such a phenomena.{nl}
If I personally have not reached the conclusion myself, I would not have believe such wild hypothesis.{nl} What we have discovered was that the particular type of Mana Metal does not become fractured in the extreme cold temperatures. Other seemingly sturdy metals are highly vulnerable to extreme temperatures. No matter how strong a certain type of metal is, it will crack into many pieces at cold temperatures.{nl}
However, the Mana Metal Ruklys collected did not have such a weakness.{nl}
Upon visiting the location of the Fortress of the Land, my conclusion was proven correct. Pieces of the Mana Metal were found. I believe that they were used in battle. My hypothesis is that a small amount of the Mana Metal is sufficient to protect against the Kings' magician's wide area magic spells.{nl}
Let's move our focus unto Ruklys. According to credible records, all the magic attacks even from the royal magicians were useless against Ruklys so the casualty toll kept rising until they had to use Lydia Schadden's arrow. Such supports my hypothesis.{nl}
Judging from the clues discovered, Ruklys should have been wearing magic resistant armor at the time.{nl}{nl}Combined with other clues during that period of time, the armor Ruklys was wearing must have been produced using a large amount of Mana Metal.
So I shall call this Mana Metal 
Cold Iron
 temporarily. {nl}{nl}

First, please bring Glizardon's bone from the 1st basement and Galok's hair from the 1st floor of Tenet Church.{nl}And also bring me the fragments of Egnome from the 2nd floor. Okay then I am counting on you.
Reality changes as I wish. And it becomes possible just by thinking!{nl}That's called super natural power.{nl}The amount of the power depends on how one belives in his power...{nl}
Okay, so you want to be a Psychokino?{nl}If you could help my work a bit, I will help you find your hidden abilities.
Please bring me the essences of Minotaur and Chapparition from Gate Route.{nl}Okay... I am counting on you.
Okay. This is it. I can tell it's full of demonic power by just looking at its color.{nl}I will teach you what the real Psychokino is from now on so you should get ready!
My old colleague who went to Sirdgela Forest told me that he saw a strange looking map.{nl}I am sure that it is the map we are looking for.
I heard Minotaur has it somewhere in the Sirdgela Forest.{nl}That monster is not easy so you should be prepared a lot.
Evoniphon...{nl}The Ranger Master still seems to have some regret.{nl}
I saw the Elementalist Master talking to a man wearing a hood.{nl}I can't say for sure if that's him, but I can never forget the fragrance.
After talking to the Elementalist, he disappeared into darkness.{nl}You better go and talk to him.
I told him that it would be obtainable in Sirdgela Forest.{nl}That's the place where even the famous the Rodelero Master's search team ran away from.
I am looking for a trace of a man. His name is Evoniphon.{nl}I heard the Sadhu Master at Akmens Ridge has his information so go there.
It's not a huge task. I want you to help my experiment...{nl}First, please bring me Burnable Juice of Tontulia from Zachariel Crossroads.
In fact, Tonturia is nothing, but the fact that there are lots of other monsters nearby is more dangerous.{nl}Hmm... Good luck!
My father is a merchant who comes to Fedimian often.{nl}But after he went into Sirdgela Forest do some transaction, he never returned.{nl}
I heard a soldier at Fedimian saw the luggage of a merchant in Sirdgela Forest.{nl}The only one I can trust right now is you. Please... I am counting on you!
This is the symbol that I engraved on my father's sleeve...{nl}This is so precious to me... Thank you.
Just put this pot on Ramstis Ridge.{nl}The problem is Chapparition there... You would be able to defeat it easily.
Please bring me Hogma Shamans and Canines of Guards at Plateau of Rex.{nl}It won't be hard or you.{nl}
I like your determination.{nl}Please defeat Sparnasman at Vieta Gorge to prove your skills.
Cataphract is a warrior who stands in front of anyone and fight.{nl}If there are barriers in the way, just penetrate into them.{nl}I came with a good idea.
I heard monsters called Biteregina are attacking tourists in Manacle Grave.{nl}I will acknowledge your skill if you could defeat those monsters.
Contratulations for passing the test.{nl}My lessons are strict so I hope you follow well.
Sparnasman at Vieta Gorge is said to be threatening people.{nl}He will not be an easy opponent, but he will be enough to prove your skills.
The most important attribute Peltasta considers valuable is courage.{nl}Since Peltasta shouldn't avoid enemies' attacks and block them with their shields.
Before you learn lessons from me, you should show me how brave you are.{nl}
Defeat Chapparition in Ramstis Ridge.{nl}That bleakness will be appropriate to test your guts.
Don't worry since I will adjust the level of dueling to your level.{nl}Okay, then I will begin!
I will show you any weapon such as a bow or a gun. Come on.
As I was transferring the research materials that I discovered before, a few of them flew away due to the wind.{nl}They are at Ramstis Ridge, but I don't have the time to find them. I am counting on you.
You found them sooner than I expected.{nl}Good, I will help you use your abilities as a Thaumaturge.
Please get me the blood of the Hogma Shaman and the Hogma Scout from King's Plateau,{nl}and lastly, the blood of the Hogma Captain from Zachariel Crossroads.
Sparnasman at Vieta Gorge would fit your reputation...{nl}Show it what the true power of serving the goddess is like.
How many times has this happened already?{nl}I am sorry but please go meet Fletcher Master to find out what happened.{nl}Go to Escanciu Village.
That dumb assistant captain took all of them and ran away to Poslinkis Forest.{nl}Maybe the monsters have them, I hope so.
There are fishing rods which Red Fishermen are carrying at Saknis Plains.{nl}When you knock on them, a whistling sound will come out. Please bring me those.
Although you learned lessons from me, I don't know if you could use all of them.{nl}I will give you an assignment. Hunt for various monsters.
Bushspiders from Kateen Forest Entrance, Ellomagos from Owl Burial Ground, and green Pokubons from Poslinkis Forest.{nl}Of course, I will give you some baits.
If you dream of reaching a higher stage as a Wugushi, there's an assignment I will give to you.{nl}Collect special poisons from Bites at Saknis Plains.
There are needles with the ointment on them that I crafted in this pot.{nl}When you hit Bites with these, you would be able to collect poisons.
It is your assignment to hunt for hidden monsters.{nl}The location is Saknis Plains. {nl}If you want to be a Scout, you should do it. Dont you think so?
If you want to learn anything from me, your feet have to be quick.{nl}Surpass 5 monsters using Smoke Bombs at the entrance of Kateen Forest.
You want to learn from me. {nl}
If that's the case, I want you to make a bet with the Hackapell Master on behalf of me.{nl}He thinks there is something in the world that can't be penetrated.{nl}
If he asks you, I will tell him that our competent Hoplite defeated it.{nl}I will now acknowledge your skills.
I heard that the other masters sent the disciples to defeat Yekub at Owl Burial Ground.{nl}But that's the task you should complete. Go there.
Leadership needs to be supported by the faith of the colleagues and the accumulated experiences.{nl}I will first have to find out if you are competent enough to command other people.
When you go to the Greene Manor, you can meet Colimencia.{nl}You are worthy to be a Centurion if you can defeat it.
This is the rope to tie people up.{nl}Practice with it enough at Poslinkis Forest so you are able to manage it well.{nl}Let's talk about my lesson after that.
Biteregina are threatening people at Owls' Village.{nl}What do you think? I want you defeat them as compensation for my lessons.
Carrying the title of 'Master', I should help others around, but I just don't have the time.{nl}Anyways, I will teach you my skills as I promised to you.
If you tell me like that, I can tell you there is a solution.{nl}If you could defeat Moas at Fedimian Suburbs, who destroyed all my ingredients, I will change your turn.
I heard the Hackapell Master is going to defeat the Shadowgaler at the Owl Burial Ground...{nl}It will be good for him to see you defeat it first.
A skilled person like you could defeat Reaverpede at Roxona Marketplace easily.{nl}If you can't do this, I can't accept you as a Ranger applicant.
Some idiot baron opened a portal that was connected to the Demon Prison.{nl}I heard that the demons there keep trying to come out.{nl}
Defeat Deadborn which is the most dangerous demon there.{nl}It will be a good hunt, don't you think?
You want to learn my skills?{nl}If you could bring me burnable woods from Jonna Jolems at Aqueduct Bridge Area, I will think about it.
Do you know this?{nl}I heard that Rajatoad at the 1st zone of Demon Prison possess dangerous poison.{nl}
We increase our level of immunity by controlling many different types of poisons.{nl}If you could survive from that poison, I will teach you how to control poison well.
You want to become a Schwarzer Reiter?{nl}It is very easy to learn how to control guns.{nl}
But, it becomes a totally different story if you want to keep aiming at the enemy rushing in.{nl}I mean courage. Why don't we check it out?{nl}
Demon Prison, I heard some dumb landlord opened the portal to the place that is full of monsters.{nl}Hunt for Deadborn there, it will be very fun.
Very nice. I feel like I am seeing myself in the past.{nl}Since you are Schwarzer Reiter now, we can be mirrors to each other from now on.
I heard that Minotaur have shown up at Roxona Marketplace.{nl}Please bring me the proof of its death.
It seems like the number of demons are constantly increasing.{nl}I heard other masters are also having some troubles.
The number of Blue Puragis at Saknis Plains has increased a lot recently and threatening villagers there.{nl}If you want to reach a higher level as a true Sahdu, show your abilities there.
Mothstem? I saw it from Fedimian Suburbs. {nl}the Pardoner Master was also looking for it. I guess he hasn't found it yet.
Instead of introducing yourself in words, it will be way better to show your abilities.{nl}My assignment for you is to defeat Reaverpede at Escanciu village.
Reaverpede at Escanciu Village would fit your reputation.{nl}I heard your name enough already, but I should see for myself.
I left a nice gift at the lower side for my future disciple.{nl}I hope you like the gift.
What present?{nl}What do you think will be the most precious gift for Necromancer?
If you want to learn my magic, I should first know how competent you are.{nl}Reaverpede at Escanciu Village would fit your reputation.
Oh, such great courage.{nl}If you could defeat Netherbovine from Poslinkis Forest, I will help you advance.
All the masters around here are chasing after the monsters.{nl}You should defeat the monsters quicker than anybody to learn my magic's.
It is called Netherbovine.{nl}According to a reliable source, it recently appeared at Poslinkis Forest.
There are more wounded people, but the amount of herbs we have is lacking.{nl}Please collect Wildflower Alcohol from Roxona Marketplace for them.
There's a monster called Colimencia at Grynas Hills.{nl}It is a threatening monster, but you should defeat it easily.
The Poata at Grynas Hills is well known for attacking people.{nl}If you could defeat it, then that will be enough.
If you want to learn from me, you should first show your skills to me.{nl}Colimencia at the Greene Manor would fit your reputation.
If you want to become a true Cataphract, then you should be able to defeat Gaigalas at Tenants' Farm.{nl}Understood? Now, hurry up.
This... It must be the symbol of the Legwyn family.{nl}Thank you. As I promised, I will help you to reach to a higher level.
You must first show your abilities before you start to learn from me. That's the manner.{nl}I think Honeypin at Tenants' Farm would be enough.
If you want to learn something from me, then come back after defeating Gaigalas in Tenants' Farm.{nl}If you want to be acknowledged in terms of both your determination and your skills.
I will be able to check your skills if you could defeat Gaigalas at Grynas Training Camp.{nl}Good luck.
Okay then... I think I can test your skills with this.{nl}I heard there's a person who saw Poata at the Greene Manor swallowing the symbol.{nl}Okay then, I am counting on you.
I am sorry, but the way of Bokor can't be searched by just anyone.{nl}If you can bring me the essence of Stone Whale at Roxona Market, I will acknowledge your skills.
The Stone Whale at Roxona Market has killed many people.{nl}I need the essence with the hatred from the people who were killed.
It is important for Sadhu to understand others' pains.{nl}Understanding their minds will be the source to increase the power of the Sadhu.{nl}
I mean we should defeat the monsters that hurt other people.{nl}From what I heard, Colimencia is creating a chaos at the Greene Manor.
Please forgive me for being too picky since this task is being done in the name of Paladin.{nl}Gaigalas at Tenants' Farm would fit your name.
If you want to reach a higher level of a Monk, show me your determination that you can endure a strict training.{nl}Bring me proof that you have defeated Netherbovine at Poslinkis Forest and I will then acknowledge your skills.
Our training is very strict.{nl}You would be able to follow our training if you could defeat Netherbovine at Poslinkis Forest.
There's a something that you should do instead of an entrance test to become a Pardoner.{nl}Retrieve the money of the lost indulgence at the region near Aqueduct Bridge Area. You can do it right?
I heard it was lost in the region near Aqueduct Bridge Area, so please find it from Aqueduct Bridge Area.

So you want to become a Falconer Master.{nl}I don't know which bird will be your friend, but when you are intereacting with it, the best thing you can use is its food.
Anything will be alright. Get some food from animal type monsters.{nl}I will test your abilities as a Pardoner by that.
If the monsters are strong, they are easier to get.{nl}If the monsters are weak, it won't be easy.

I heard that Minotaur have it somewhere in Sirdgela Forest.{nl}I heard that monster is not easy so you should be prepared a lot.
He disappeared into darkness after talking to the Elementalist Master.{nl}You better go talk to him.
Actually, Tontulias are not that hard, but the other enemies are more dangerous.{nl}Hmm... Good Luck!
You should be quick in order to learn from me.{nl}Use smoke bombs at the training field in front of Kateen Forest entrance, and defeat the monsters.{nl}Some of them are really strong, so be ready.

If you want to learn from me, you should first show me your skills.{nl}Honeypin at Tenants' Farm would be good.
Congratulations for the birth of new Bokor.{nl}When I selected the way of Bokor, I started off by making my own doll.{nl}
We don't accept just anyone as a Peltasta.{nl}I will give you an assignment. First, defeat all Vubbes that are occupying the 1st floor of Crystal Mine.
I can see your passion to become a Pyromancer, but that passion is not enough.{nl}I will make the decision based on how well you support my research.
I can now move on to the next stage of the research because of you.{nl}You can always come to learn magic. Well done.
Welcome. You shall eliminate the evil that I summon.{nl}I will record the unique wavelength that will come out of this process.
I am researching about the 4th state about the substance.{nl}It can't be done without support from the Bokor Master who controls spirits.
Good. {nl}Since that research is being progressed with the Bokor Master, she will tell you what to do when you go meet her.
You want to learn magic from me?{nl}Of course I can teach you. If you could do me a favor.
This will be enough.{nl}It will be hard from this stage so you should follow well.
You want to be a Ranger? Then I will request something to you. {nl}I will decide whether I should teach you based on how well you complete the task.
So the books are all gathered. Well done.{nl}As I promised to you, I will permit you to become a Hunter.{nl}
And this is my present. {nl}You will be able to purchase Velheider.
Well done. {nl}I expect you to fulfill my expectations.
When you and your opponent fight with swords, you will find out your opponent's skill.{nl}If you could prove to me your qualifications as a warrior, I will teach you what a true warrior is.
Nice.{nl}You are more than enough to be a warrior.
That's good. There are many eyes here so go ahead to the base camp. {nl}I will follow you soon.
Why are you lingering? {nl}Didn't I tell you to go to camp already?
It's easy to teach you how to use a spear, but your mind should be ready for it.{nl}The assignment is easy, but it's little troublesome.
Glizardon Leather in Tenet Church B1, Galok's canine in Tenet Church 1F.{nl}And black powders from Egnome... I am counting on you.
Defeat Carcashus at Septyni Glen to collect the seeds.{nl}They break easily so it's not easy to get the decent ones.
Good. The seeds are okay.{nl}When you start to learn from me, you will realize how great this is.
Anyway, well done.{nl}Let's get along well from now on.
I was looking for a book. Four books of Lydia Schaffen.{nl}If you could help me finding those books, I will permit you to become a Hunter.
I heard enough about your achievements. You still have lots of potentials.{nl}We are looking for someone who could find the books of Lydia Schaffen and you've shown up at the right time. You will help us right?
Good. This is it!{nl}As I promised to you, I will teach you high level Quarrel Shooter skills.{nl}
If you want to learn skills of Archer, I have a request to you.{nl}I hope you help us finding the books of Lydia Schaffen.
Finally, I am seeing this with my own eyes!{nl}Well done. I will teach you a new skill right away.
There are books that I wish to collect. They are Lydia Schaffen's books.{nl}If you could collect them, I will teach you high level Ranger skills. How about it?
The problem is the Hunter Master. I don't want to see such woman's face.{nl}So I want you to purchase the next volume from her and think of it as your next lesson fee.
I think about 5,000 silver should be enough.{nl}You can afford it right?
Finally, I collected them all. Well done.{nl}It's easy to teach, but it's your responsibility to follow well.
A sculptor needs to be competent, but he also needs to identify good ingredients.{nl}If you could bring me Blue Crystal which I am looking for, I will help you to become a Dievdirbys.
Finally, you don't look like a newbie anymore. I will give you an important task.{nl}If you do a good job, I will promise to help you become the next level Highlander.
The task is to receive help from Peltastas.{nl}They will welcome you if you could bring coarse tree barks of Mentiwood from Septyni Glen.
You've done a good job completing the mission.{nl}The kingdom's rebuild will not be far if we, the masters, keep a close relationship.
You seem to be ready to progress to the next level Peltasta.{nl}Good, but you should complete the task well in order to receive the learning.
I once receive a help from the Highlander Master.{nl}We, Peltastas value the moral rights that humans should abide the most.
It's good to hear that the Highlander Master liked it.{nl}Now, come to me anytime.
Collect the toe nails of Biteroses at Septyni Glen and hand them over to the Highlander Master.{nl}I think that task should be appropriate for you.
It's not hard to teach you high level magic... but, you should help be before I teach them to you.{nl}I should collect the energies of fire that are needed for the research, but I just don't have time for that.
The book I am looking for is very valuable.{nl}If you could find that book for me, I will help you learn new magic of the Cryomancer.
A true Krivis should be humble and make offerings to the goddesses.{nl}You should pray and make offerings to every Goddess Statue in Siauliai Woods.{nl}
I can sense that you are full of blessings from the goddesses.{nl}Brother, I will lead you the way of a true Krivis.
According to an old saying, those who seek death shall live.{nl}You should first realize the meaning of this saying before I teach you further.
If that's so, fight Carcashus at Septyni Glen.{nl}You will learn something from it.
The most important thing for a true Priest is to trust the goddesses and prove it to them.{nl}Please exorcise the evil spirit from a soldier in the name of the goddesses.
You can learn high level magic after helping my research first.{nl}Let's see whether you are qualified to learn them after you help me first.
First, get me Glizardon Horn from Tenet Church B1, Galok Feather from 1F, {nl}and Egnome FragmentS from 2F. Thanks.
Well done. We've collected good documents as a result.{nl}Since we successfully completed the urgent research, let's start the lesson again.
As a Cleric, I think the most effective way to get nearest to the goddess is dedication.{nl}If you could help me curing the soldiers at Crystal Mine, I will certainly help you.
You can use the divine water as much as you want in the name of the Cleric Master.{nl}He is so kind, I am jealous of him.
When you are getting the divine water from the Masters, I want you to pass my regards as well.
Well done.{nl}I may not be competent enough, but I will help with my best so you could bet nearer to the goddesses.
If I were to be your spear, I would be really happy.{nl}Good. Are you ready to become the owner of the spear?
Good.{nl}Please show me the spear that is completed to level 6.
The reality moves as I imagine. Thoughts solely make it possible!{nl}The power of them differs by how one trusts himself...{nl}
That's called the super natural power.{nl}Okay. If you could help my task, I will help you so that you could show your real abilities.
Asking me to help you become the greatest Quarrel Shooter, you have such a high ambition. {nl}That's good to hear. I was looking for someone who could help me as well.
Oh, so this is the map. Well done.{nl}I think you may surpass me.
It's silly to hear that you want to be the greatest Ranger.{nl}But, that's okay. If you could help me, that dream may not be just a dream.
This fragrance... Yes. This is Evoniphon's.{nl}This will be enough. Shall we start the lesson again?
So the best is Sapper, right?{nl}But, you can't become it for free. You should do me a favor.
Anyway, well done.{nl}If you want to learn new skills, come to me anytime.
I can see the stronger light from you.{nl}Please get me the card that you could obtain from the strong monster.
Sometimes, the destined cruel fate may lead you to dark future.{nl}I wish the goddesses lead you safely as you walk on the way of Bokor that you've chosen.
It is a completely different story to simply carve from blazing a new stage.{nl}Of course, I could help you a bit.
I am looking for a cat that can be a model, but it's so hard due to my old age.{nl}It will be so good if you could bring a suitable cat for me.{nl}
You are already at the stage to learn high level magic? {nl}As a compensation for teaching you, I have a favor to ask you.
It is simple, but little dangerous. {nl}You want to challenge for it?
Just put this pot on Ramstis Ridge.{nl}The problem is the Chapparition there... But, you would be enough to defeat it.
Well done.{nl}Now, is this going to be the last lesson...
I can promise you the higher stage power if it were me.{nl}But, of course you should pay for the lesson fee.
From the 1st floor of Royal Mausoleum, please bring me hard skins of Varvs and rigid horns of Zinutekas.{nl}It will not be hard since you are my disciple.
Well done.{nl}I will help you to Cryomancer Master.
Cataphract. {nl}I am not sure if that's going to suitable for you.
A true Cataphract is the warrior who fights at the front.{nl}If anything obstructs the way of a Cataphract, just destroy it.{nl}Ah, I just remembered something.
I heard monsters called Biteregina attack the tourists at Mannacle Grave.{nl}If you could defeat them, I will teach you what is the true Cataphract.
I knew you would do it.{nl}It will be hard from now on, so follow me well.
Only battles can make us strong.{nl}If you want to be a true Barbarian, prove yourself!
Our method is simple. You are qualified if you are alive, and you are not if you are dead.{nl}You are more than qualified since you are alive.
Follow me to the north of the base camp. {nl}I shall review your strength over there.
Not here, it's north of the base camp.
Now is the time to enhance the qualities of Manas that you possess as a Linker.{nl}Any magic is okay. I will test you by dueling.
Hunters only speak in terms of bows. {nl}I will adjust myself to your level, so if you want to be a stronger Hunter, try defeating me.
The highest level of Highlander... You seem to still be hesitating.{nl}But, having no hesitation is also the part of the way of the Highlander. Are you ready?
Respond with a shield without avoiding enemies' attacks.{nl}Bravery is the most important quality in Peltastas.
I can open up the way to become the highest level Peltasta for you.{nl}But, you should also prove to me your bravery.
Now is the time, brother. Sincerity is the power of Krivis.{nl}Prove your sincerity that you've accumulated so far by dueling against me.
Your sincerity is like the rigid stone pole.{nl}I will help you to reach higher level.
The devotion of Priests shall not change in any circumstances.{nl}I will test whether your devotion would stand still even in the worst circumstances by dueling against you.
Throw away your hesitation and fill your heart in with the blessings of the goddesses.{nl}With these blessings, I will help you to reach the highest level.
We Wugushi do not hesitate to use poison.{nl}We will first show you how to fight. We will use bows, blowguns, whatever is available.
Good. Let me teach you a lesson. {nl}This place is too tight so go ahead to the vacant lot down the Karas Highway.
You must be scared, still standing there. {nl}If not, then wait in Karas Highway.
So you want to be a Rodelero? Then check your shield first. {nl}When I first chose this path, I started out by getting a 4th degree shield.
Prepare a shield enhanced 4 degrees. {nl}I need to check your will at least.
If you wish to become a Thaumaturge, it is an honor for me.{nl}But, before that, I want you to do a simple errand.
You found it faster than I expected.{nl}Okay then let's start the lesson right away.
Please get me Varv Resin, Zinutekas Tail Fragments, and Boowook Activation Cores.
Well done indeed.{nl}Since you've completed the mission, I will start the lesson of Elementalist right away.
If you could prove your skills by dueling against me, I will teach you the true skills of Scout.
As there's a lot to prepare, go on ahead to the vacant lot below Karas Highway, I'll go there as soon as I finish.
It's troublesome to duel here. There is a vacant lot below Karas Highway, I'll meet you there.
It is very impressive to find someone who wants to learn from me.{nl}Okay. If could find my belongings, I will accept you as a Corsair.
That idiot of a captain took everything and fled to the Forest of Prayer.{nl}It's possible that monsters may have taken them. I hope that's the case.
Fight against me with everything you've got. I will show you how to fight with a sword and a shield.{nl}I may teach you more or eliminate you depending on your skills.
I cannot determine your true potential here, so show it to me at the vacant lot below Karas Highway.
You have a bad habit on your body, but there's a room for improvement.{nl}As you know, my teaching is very strict so you should be well prepared for it.
You want to learn skills from me?{nl}I will think about it, if you collect the wood I am looking for.
The level of the strongest Hunter... I am not sure if you could follow well.{nl}I will give you an assignment. Hunt for various types of monsters.
Duckies from Sunset Flag Forest, Black Drakes from the 5th floor of Mage Tower, and Kowaks from Forest of Prayer.{nl}It will not be easy to find them.
If you want to be a stronger Wugushi, I will give you an assignment.{nl}Collect special Poison from Bites in Saknis Plains.
It is hard to get away from the attraction of poison. I am one of those people.{nl}Okay, then shall we start?
It is your assignment to hunt for the monsters that are hidden.{nl}The location is Apsimesti Crossroads. {nl}You should do it if you want to become a stronger Scount. Don't you think so?
You've done it easily.{nl}Okay then, shall me move on to the Intensified stage?{nl}
Rogues should be fast.{nl}Fight against the monsters at the training field near the entrance of Kateen Forest using smoke bombs.{nl}Some of them are really strong so you should aware of them.
Elusiveness is the most attractive property of Rogue.{nl}With swift movements, Rogue makes it's enemies dizzy.
The perfect stage of Hoplite destroys everything.{nl}Unfortunately, my colleague the Hackapell Master does not believe in such a thing.
If you could help prove it for me, he will realize the truth.{nl}How about it?
Spears are mighty and never lose.{nl}I want to see the guy's pitiful face after Shadowgaler is dead.
If my friend asks us, I will tell him that our competent Hoplite defeated it.{nl}You reached the level of a master, but if you need any help, you can come to me.
You want to become the greatest Barbarian.{nl}There's something you should do.{nl}
The other masters sent the disciples to Owl Burial Ground to eliminate Yekubs.{nl}But, that should be done by you. Destroy them and return to me.
Yekub will be easy for the greatest Barbarian.
When you go to the Greene Manor, you would be able to meet Colimencia.{nl}You should be competent enough to face them in order to become a Centurion.
Squire shines more when he is with his partner instead of being alone.{nl}Especially the attacks that involve ropes with a partner is stronger than any other attacks.
This is an arrest rope.{nl}Take this to the Poslinkis Forest and practice so you can catch at least 3 at once.{nl}Let's talk about Squire afterwards. {nl}{nl}
Did you get used to it?{nl}Let's learn slowly from now on.
I heard the monsters called Biteregina in Manacle Grave are attacking people there.{nl}How do you think about it? I want you to think of it as a compensation for learning my skills.
Since I am a Master, I should help the others, but I just don't have enough time.{nl}Anyway, it is really splendid. But, get ready to become more stronger Sapper.
If you say so, there's another way.{nl}If you could defeat Moas at Fedimian Suburbs, I will let you go first.
I will give you this flare. {nl}You would be able to find the hidden monsters more easily.
I was waiting for you. I knew that you would come to find me.{nl}But, I guess you came here since you are competent enough. Right?{nl}
For example, dueling against me and win.
Nice.{nl}You could start the next level training whenever you want.
Now the time has come. It is so great that you came this far.{nl}But, your skills should be more than the average to reach the next level.
I heard some idiotic baron opened the portal that is connected to Demon Prison.{nl}I received the request to block the demons from coming out from the Wing of Vaivora.
I want to pass the task of defeating Deadborn to you.{nl}I think they will be good for hunting.
Very good indeed. You are competent enough.{nl}If you want to learn a new skill, you are always welcomed.
That's why you should help me.{nl}Could you bring me natural Mano stones from Rocktortuga at Ruklys Memorial site?
Don't be greedy on learning a new skill and just continue on what you were doing.{nl}I will think again if you could bring burnable coals from Yonazolems at Aqueduct Bridge Area.
You possess splendid skills.{nl}I am happy to accept such disciple. I will teach you my skills.
I received a request to block Rajatoad of Demon Prison from the Wings of Vaivora.{nl}If you aim to be the greatest Wugushi, I think you should defeat them. How about it?
What did you do to open that portal?{nl}Very good, good.
You never let down my expectations. Well done.{nl}Okay. Shall we proceed again?
Nice. I feel like I am seeing myself in old days.{nl}You are truly a Schwarzer Reiter.
Strange incidents are occurring because the world is like this.{nl}I heard the other masters are also having hard times.
The villagers are complaining because of Rocktortugas in the West Siauliai Woods.{nl}If you could defeat those monsters, I will give you precious offerings.
I am sorry, but there's something you should do for me.{nl}Let's get to the conversation later... First, please bring me the jewel I left to the Krivis Master.
It is also a Dievdirbys' task to take special care about the work with affections instead of just making it.{nl}If you dream to become a Dievdirbys that will be remembered for a long time, please do not forget this feeling.
The number of Red Tree Ambulos has increased a lot at Apsimesti Crossroads and threatening the villagers there.{nl}If you want to step forward as a true Sadhu, share your abilities.
Good. But we're in front of the Holy Goddess Statue. {nl}I will test it in Shiluma Altar Site.
Your faith is splendid indeed. {nl}I will permit your entrance. The training of us, monks is harsh so you should be prepared for it.
Yes, that's it! It's been there all along.{nl}Anyway, I grant your entrance to the road of Pardoner.
Fire Jar? Sure I know about it. {nl}But I'm a merchant. So unless you get me Hardened Oil from Puragis in Saknis Plains...
The poatas at Siauliai east forest is threatening the villagers.{nl}If you could defeat that monster in the name of the goddesses, I will teach you my magic.{nl}{nl}
Well done. The goddesses would be satisfied.{nl}As I promised, I will take you to the higher level of Pyromancer.
Psychokinos show their powers by trusting their abilities.{nl}You should show how much you trust yourself to go into the perfect Psychokino's level.
Red Vubbe Warriors in this forest are hard to face against.{nl}But, if you trust yourself, you will be able to face them.
The highest level of Linker... I want to know how you control Mana.{nl}I don't care what kind of magic you would use, just defeat Vubbe Warriors at East Siauliai Woods.
You have the most splendid abilities among the ones that I've met before.{nl}But if you learn the new control, you will be the greatest Linker.
Before we learn the next level magic, I should test your magical knowledge.{nl}The Salamanders who climb Mage Tower would be enough.
Nice.{nl}With this, you will be able to learn new magic without any problem.
Without exaggerating your words, it's way better to show yourself.{nl}Defeat Reaverpede at Escanciu village will be your next assignment for the next level.
If you want to become my disciple, I should first understand your skills.{nl}The Reaverpede at Escanciu village will be enough.
I knew you would come.{nl}You felt the limit as a Thaumaturge right?
But, there are still remaining levels.{nl}First, I will check whether you would be able to defeat Netherbovine near Fedimian.
There is no limit for Thaumaturges.{nl}But, if one has the limit, there is no other way.{nl}
Anyway, you've successfully completed the assignment.{nl}Shall we learn the next magic?
The masters near here are chasing after the monsters that are making chaos.{nl}If you are the greatest Elementalist, you should first defeat those monsters faster than anyone else.
I can picture the faces of the other masters.{nl}Not only that, I am so happy to hear that you are suitable to become the true Elementalist.
I heard Necroventer appeared again at Goddess' Ancient Garden.{nl}If you want to learn high magic of Sorcerer, I think it would be adequate opponent. What do you think?
It is so silly.{nl}Do nothing in front of such a nice quarry.
So you don't disappoint me at all.{nl}Now, you know what to do next right?
I can always teach higher level magic. {nl}But, I am not sure if you could follow me.
You are more than my expectations.{nl}But, you should be prepared since it's going be harder than before.
Long time no see. You want to become an Alchemist.{nl}First, we should find out if you can be an Alchemist.
Good. {nl}I am looking forward from now on.
To follow the training of a Priest, you should first demonstrate your willingness to drive out evil forces.{nl}Take the bags with demonic power away from the Vubbes at Siauliai Miners' Village.
You will probably be find a lot of Vubbes at the Vubbe Outpost and their refugee camp.
While magics does not choose its wielder, I don't like a lazy disciple.{nl}Defeating Stone Orcas in Crystal Mine 1F as a test of your guts.
Clerics must be of service to others if they wish to achieve a higher stage in life.{nl}Please collect Green Ointments from the Vubbes at Miners' Village so you could cure more people.
Eliminate the bats in Crystal Mine 1F and bring their wings as a proof.
There is a monster called Colimencia in Grynas Hills. {nl}It is a threatening monster, but you should be able to defeat it easily.
Finally, you are a true Rodelero.{nl}But, how about Colimencia... The dangerous monster at the Greene Manor.
If there's something lacking, that means we have a room to improve.{nl}Don't worry. I can fill that in for you.
If you dream to become the greatest Cataphract, you should be able to defeat Gaigalas in Tenants' Farm easily.{nl}If you understand, come back quickly.
Once you decide to become the greatest, there's nothing to be afraid of. {nl}Assignments or whatever... I will just destroy everything. Don't you think so?
I like you more as I see you more.{nl}Okay. Let's get started.
I am busy personally... I am sorry.{nl}I heard a report saying that someone saw the symbol of the lost family so I am chasing after it.
This... is the symbol of the Legwyn family.{nl}Thanks. As I promised, I will teach you new skills.
Pirates have their levels and Corsairs too.{nl}Maybe the Honeypin at Tenants' Farm will be able to locate you exactly.
Wow, this is unexpected.{nl}It will be okay even if I teach you harder skills.
If you want to become a Doppelsoeldner, hunt for Gaigalas at Tenants' Farm.{nl}If you want to acknowledged in terms of your determination and skills.
This is usable.{nl}Good. I welcome you as a Doppelsoeldner.
You will feel that is too much.{nl}But, you should realize your weaknesses in order to reach higher level Rodelero.{nl}
I know that you are growing well as a competent Paladin.{nl}But, I want to check with my own eyes.
Very well indeed.{nl}I will lead you to become the highest level Paladin.
You want to advance? Then there's something you should do for me instead of a test.{nl}Please retrieve the lost indulgence money from Aqueduct Bridge Area. You can do it right?
At the time when I didn't know what to do, the goddesses have sent you.{nl}Anyway, congratulations on your advancement.
During the duel, I found out that the one who led you to the way of an Oracle were the goddesses.{nl}You should do the interpretations, but I will help you to make correct interpretations.
Actually, it's pretty hard to get your first Hawk.{nl}But you are a Falconer too now, so I will help you with that.

Please collect Tail Pins from Desmoduses in Tenet Church B1.{nl}They break easily so it's hard to get the decent ones.
Nice. The Tail Pins are not broken.{nl}After our lesson, you will realize how great this is.
You should get support from the Peltasta Master.{nl}She will welcome you if you obtain Coarse Tree Bark from Yognomes at Tenet Church B1.
Please collect black needles from Glizardons in Tenet Church B1 and hand them over to the Highlander Master.{nl}I think that will be an adequate mission for you.
If that's so, fight against Glizardons in Tenet Church B1.{nl}You'll come to realize something by doing so.
You want to become an Alchemist.{nl}I'll find out if you are suitable.
You want to be a better Squire.{nl}If you could fulfill my request, I will certainly help you.{nl}
The Legwyn family once had a mansion that's now ruins.{nl}It got that way because of some incident... but, I don't want it to remain that way.{nl}I can't do anything about it at the moment, but please at least return the seal of the Legwyn family from there.
You will find the seal which once shined brightly when you go to the ruins of the Legwyn family mansion.{nl}It is either broken or you may have hard time identifying it's original shape... hopefully it hasn't been totally destroyed by the monsters.
How awful... If I become the official heir of the Legwyn family, I won't let it remain that way.{nl}Of course, I will remember to reward you as the Squire who completed my request.
I don't mind meeting someone who wants to learn from me.{nl}But, that doesn't mean I will accept just anyone.{nl}
When the coral plain was once underwater, {nl}I fought with the great pirate Vladslovas to decide who was the strongest.{nl}I won, but Vladslovas's necklace, which I should have taken as proof of my victory, fell into the sea.{nl}
I gave up since it was far too deep back then, but I may be able to find it since the area has turned into land.{nl}Go to Cranto Coast and look for the necklace.{nl}It is quite dazzling, so you won't have hard time finding it.
If I could find it, the people who thought I was bluffing will be very surprised!
You really found it!{nl}It is badly damaged, but I am sure this is it.{nl}Okay, I will teach you my skills as I promised to you!
A centurion needs to contribute to the kingdom and thinks of it as his fame.{nl}Recently, I am collecting the flags of several Kingdom military squads that were annhilated on Medzio Diena.{nl}I hope you also help this task for the fame of kingdom soldiers.
I heard there are kingdom soldiers who went lost at the training field of conflict on Medzio Diena.{nl}I don't expect that they are alive, but to remember their loyalty to the kingdom, I want you to find their flag.
The flag is not in a good status... It would've been better if you had found it little sooner...{nl}My heart aches to see the flag is in this status, but I can't forget you who helped me a lot.{nl}I will help you so that you could develop yourself to a higher stage.
You came here to learn more as a Doppelsoeldner?{nl}But, right now, I have some important task to do now...{nl}Yes, since I trust you, can you do this instead of a test?{nl}
There's something I am preparing right now so I should meet someone, but he can't be contacted lately.{nl}I want to go and check him myself, but since the task I am preparing is being progressed quietly, I can't go there since I will be spotted by lots of people.{nl}Can you go there for me?
The person I am trying to meet is the envoy of General Ramin.{nl}I didn't hear anything from him since we had contacted each other at Pilgrim's Way 36_2.{nl}Go there and find out whether something is happening.
Damn... I don't want to believe it, but according to what you just told me, it seems that he died due to the attacks from the monsters.{nl}I guess I should contact General Ramin with another method.{nl}Ah, and please keep this secret to other people.{nl}
Of course, I didn't forget the promise to you.{nl}I will help you to grow up to be a better Doppelsoeldner.
I am researching about the eternal life recently.{nl}I am investigating various documents, but it will be the best to listen from the one who is living an eternal life.{nl}I want to listen from a few of Amjinas that are still present in this world...{nl}
It's not good for me to visit them as a master and we masters were separated for a long time.{nl}This is also a part of the research as a Sorcerer so ask them how they live eternal lives.{nl}If you could do that for me, I will upgrade your abilities as a Sorcerer one level up.
Among the Amjinas, the whereabouts of the Dievdirbys Master from the West Siauliai Woods, the Necromancer Master at Mullers Passage, and the Chronomancer Master at Stele Road have been confirmed.{nl}Ask each of them how they live an eternal life.
Amjinas are indeed different.{nl}I should think more widely and find them out.{nl}
Good, I will lead you to a higher level Sorcerer.
You've come to enhance you abilities as a Chronomancer.{nl}But, right now I am helping the task which the Alchemist Master from the Winterspoon family requested to me so I can't help you at the moment.{nl}
{nl}If you are okay, could you help me with this task little more?{nl}If that's so, I will finish it quickly and help you.
It seems that the Alchemist Master is investigating about Crystal Mine. {nl}To do so, he asked me to lend him my orb to that reads the past of the person which the orb used to belong to.{nl}Explore all the regions of the 1st district and the 2nd district in Crystal Mine.{nl} 
If you had explored the regions completely in the past, the orb will read your memories and records the past.{nl}Then the task will be much easier.
It's been recorded completely.{nl}Good. I will pass this to the Alchemist Master.{nl}Now is my turn to help you.
The power of Necromancer will always be expressed through the materials that act as catalysts.{nl}That power will be influenced by the abilities of Necromancer himself and his power.{nl}If you want to advance more as a Necromancer, it's important that you obtain those materials. 
Strong grudge is swirling around Videntis Shrine according to what I found out.{nl}When you go there, you will find the materials that possess the thoughts of the dead ones.{nl}If you could obtain those, I will open the door of a higher level Necromancer.
The bigger the grudge or regrets spirits have in their past lives, the stronger the power of their keepsakes.{nl}Find the keepsakes in which strong regrets can be felt.
This is the object that I can feel strong regret.{nl}If you will be able to pick out this kind of object, you will become a stronger Necromancer.{nl}For now, I will help you as a reward for the object.
So you've come here to learn higher level abilities of Alchemist.{nl}But, there's something I should do fast so I can't teach at the moment.{nl}It could be dangerous if I leave it like that so I am trying to finish it quickly.{nl}
Could you help for the task?{nl}If that's so, I will teach you the abilities of Alchemist as a return.
So the Alchemist Master sent you here?{nl}I've prepared it since the head of the Winterspoon family requested it.{nl}Please go back with this.
Good.{nl}I am investigating Crystal Mine... I need the orb that records the memories of the Chronomancer Master.{nl}He is the head of our Winterspoon family so I've requested it to him in advance. Tell him that I've sent you.
Lucid... Actually have you met the Chronomancer Master well?
You've brought the orb well.{nl}The orb that records the past has the power to read the memories of the possessor and record.{nl}If it acknowledges you as its possessor, it will read the memories and if there's more to be investigated, you should find them on your own.
Explore all the areas in the 1st district and the 2nd district in Crystal Mine with this orb.{nl}If you've explored it completely in the past, the orb will read the memories of the possessor and record the past.
This is the orb of the Chronomancer Master.{nl}It's been recorded well.{nl}
I want to check this right away, but I guess I should keep the promise with you first.{nl}I will teach you the abilities of Alchemist.
This story is said to have taken place one day at the Astral Tower.{nl}A dispute among the disciples of Lydia Schaffen broke out.{nl}Several disciples gathered after the training and in the process such a dialog is said to have come up: 'No matter how good your bow is, if your skills are lacking, you can't bring out its full potential. Therefore, what is important in the end is your own skill.'{nl}Such was a claim of a certain disciple, which started the dispute.{nl}
'You are forgetting the basics of archery. What is an archer? It is someone who uses a tool called a bow, right?{nl}Do you think an archer existing without a bow is possible? {nl}Even if one gets famous for their skill with sword and spear, can one still call themselves an archer? In the end, archery is the concept of depending on tools, isn't it?'{nl}
The disciple who had a different view argued back:{nl}'You said tools are important, let's talk about that.{nl}What is a bow? There are various weapons for an archer. Just like there are weapons that don't need much skill to handle, like a crossbow, there are also weapons, effectiveness of which varies a lot based on a user's skill, like the ones of the Wugushi.{nl}The Wind Arrow of the Wugushi is hard to master, it's a difficult weapon to wield for someone without experience, no matter how good the materials of one's bow are.{nl}
This is the same as saying that since people will die if they don't eat, their lives are less important than food and depend on it.{nl}Are you claiming that since you eat to be able to live on, you are living to eat?'{nl}Upon that, another disciple shared his viewpoint:{nl}'You are arguing about the path of the Archer, but you are only concentrating on one aspect.{nl}What you fail to address is that no matter how famous an Archer one is, no matter how eagle-eyed one is, what they are using to their advantage is the wind. {nl}
The arrow could not be shot if it wasn't for the wind and air that carries it to the mark, how could any sharpshooter exist, or rather, how much would an archer be able to do in that case? In the end, what is necessary for an archer is to sense the wind flow and to be able to act on it.'{nl}
Lydia Schaffen continued eating while listening to the disciples, keeping her position on the railing. After they finished, she kept quiet for a while, but before long she fiddled with her fingers through the pile of shells of chestnuts she had eaten and picked out something, reportedly saying this: {nl}'What is this?'{nl}The disciple with the sharp eyes answered before anyone could.{nl}'It's the inner skin of a chestnut.'{nl}
It was very obvious that it was indeed the inner skin of a chestnut, so the others nodded in agreement and waited for their master's next words. {nl}And so Lydia Schaffen continued. {nl}'No. This is the notch of my arrow.'{nl}
One day Lydia Schaffen left a certain village alone and walked around at night.{nl} Lydia Schaffen saw a traveler sitting wearily at the roadside on a woodland road. {nl} Out of curiosity, she decided to approach him.{nl} 'Why are you sitting here in the forest in the middle of the night?'{nl}The traveler was hesitant to answer at first, but after being asked multiple times he finally opened his mouth. {nl}The reason was apparently this: {nl}
In the past, Rumpelstiltskin was quite famous for challenging his opponents to use their best skill and then defeating them. {nl} But, he changed the rules of his game a bit every time. {nl} Lydia Schaffen asked: 'I understand that you want to challenge my archery skill, so what are we going to do?'{nl}
'Of course, a game to see who is better with a bow would not be that interesting. Therefore, let's play a game where you fire an arrow at a target, and then I will try to catch and ride the arrow before it reaches the target,' said Rumpelstiltskin. {nl}Lydia replied, questioning the proposal: 'Ride an arrow?'{nl}'That is correct,' averred Rumpelstiltskin.{nl}
Upon answering, Rumpelstiltskin started to shrink his body.{nl} Once he had reduced himself to the size of a child's fist, Rumpelstiltskin spoke: 'Well, this size will allow me to ride your arrow, right?'{nl}Lydia Schaffen thought for a bit,{nl}'There is a problem with that, though. If you touch the arrow and cause it to fall to the ground without it ever hitting the target, then wouldn't that still be a loss for me regardless of whether you rode the arrow or not?'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin answered her with these words.{nl}
'Then how about this. I win if I can ride your arrow until it reaches the target.'{nl} 'And if your arrow falls to the ground,' he continued, 'then we both lose.'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin added, 'The game shall have three rounds, best two out of three.'{nl}
After Rumpelstiltskin's seemingly honest answer, Lydia Schaffen replied, 'Alright, one more thing: I'm going to shoot at any target, in any direction. I'll tell you what the target is each round. This way, you won't be able to get used to it for rounds two and three. Are you okay with this?{nl}'Alright, let's do that,' agreed Rumpelstiltskin. {nl}After also agreeing upon terms of defeat, the game between two people, err, one person and one demon began.{nl}
Lydia Schaffen weighed her arrow, then called out the first target:{nl}'The tallest brown tree over there!'{nl}With those words, she released the arrow and it sliced through the air at a frightful speed{nl}
Rumpelstiltskin moved nimbly to chase the flying arrow, and after he got on, the arrow impaled the tree. As the arrow continued to oscillate, he danced to the rhythm of the oscillation and sang an unknown tune.{nl}Lydia Schaffen again gauged her arrows, then she called:{nl}'All of the cones on that pine tree on my front-left side!'{nl}Upon calling the target, Lydia Schaffen unleashed her godlike archery skills. 
'So there, I managed to sit on every single arrow before the last arrow reached the target. I win.'{nl} Lydia Schaffen replied,{nl}' Certainly, I can't deny the fact you sat on every arrow before the last one reached its target.'{nl}
Rumpelstiltskin gave a wicked grin after hearing Lydia Schaffen's words and said,{nl}'Meaning, I won this game. Now, as for the penalty we agreed on...'{nl}Before Rumpelstiltskin could finish, Lydia Schaffen shook her head and spoke,{nl}'Don't tell me that because you won two rounds, you won't play the final round? It's not acceptable, we clearly promised to play three rounds anyway, didn't we?'{nl}
'The game doesn't end before the third round, so I think it's pointless to talk about penalties before the game has actually ended...'{nl}
Recognizing that he has already won two rounds and had no reason to refuse a third, as well as the fact the game was certainly not over yet, Rumpelstiltskin had no choice but to abide by Lydia Schaffen's words.{nl}And so the final round began, Lydia Schaffen gauged her last arrow, and called out as she pulled the bowstring back:{nl}'My target is... the moon in the sky!'{nl}Rumpelstiltskin side-saddled the arrow as soon as it left the bowstring, and not before long, he realized what he heard.
Just as Rumpelstiltskin, grinding his teeth, was about to open his mouth, Lydia Schaffen said,{nl}'For the game to end, you need to ride the arrow until it arrives at its target. The game cannot end before then. If you manage to touched the moon and come back, then I will definitely accept the penalty.'{nl}Having said so, Lydia Schaffen began walking away as Rumpelstiltskin watched, grinding his teeth once again, unable to change the course of the game.

I have recently been researching eternal life.{nl}I am investigating various documents, but it will be the best to listen from those who are already living an eternal life.{nl}
Those that have eternal life are called Amjinas. I want you to ask them how they live eternal lives.{nl}It's not good for me to visit them as a master since we masters are living in different places.
Among the Amjinas, there is Sculptor Tesla at West Siauliai Woods...{nl}The Necromancer Master at Mullers Passage, and the Chronomancer Master at Stele Road. I am counting on you.
These Amjinas all seem to have different reasons behind their situations.{nl}I should look harder at each...{nl}
Anyway, thank you for helping my research.{nl}In return, I'll teach you any remaining knowledge of what it is to be a Sorcerer.
You've come to learn a higher level of our magic, {nl}but, right now I am helping Vaidotas from the Winterspoon family, so I can't help you at the moment.{nl}
{nl}If you are okay, could you help me investigate the Crystal Mine?{nl}If so, I will finish up quickly and focus on helping you.
With this orb, explore all of District 1 and 2 of the Crystal Mine.{nl}If you've done this already, then you just need to record it in the orb.
It's been recorded completely.{nl}Good. I will pass this to Vaidotas.{nl}Now is my turn to help you.
The thoughts of the dead... All Necromancers want to possess them, {nl}especially those regarding lost keepsakes.{nl}
According to what I found out, there's a strong grudge swirling around Videntis Shrine.{nl}If you could obtain whatever it is causing this grudge, I will open the door to a higher level of Necromancy.
If you will be able to pick out this kind of object, you will become a stronger Necromancer.{nl}For now, I'll reward you if you can find one.
Ah, you came at the right time. {nl}I am investigating the Crystal Mine, but it will be dangerous if we leave it as is, so I want to take care of it quickly.{nl}
If you could help me, I think the investigation would be done sooner.{nl}It will be also a great chance to test your skills as an Alchemist.
I am glad that Vaidotas asked me for a favor.{nl}Return with this.
Good.{nl}I need the orb that records the memories of the past from the Chronomancer Master.{nl}He is the head of our Winterspoon family, so I've requested it from him in advance. Tell him that I've sent you.
Lucid... Actually have you met the Chronomancer Master well?
The orb reads the past memories of its owner and records them.{nl}Completely explore District 1 and 2 in the Crystal Mine with this.{nl}
When you use this orb after exploring completely, it will read the memories of the possessor and record the past.{nl}If you had explored the regions in the past, then record it into the orb right away.{nl}
Well done. {nl}It will take some time to investigate this, so in the meantime, I will teach you new alchemy techniques.
