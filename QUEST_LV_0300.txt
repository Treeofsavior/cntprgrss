We were deployed here from headquarters to support the Knights of Kaliss.{nl}If you want to know more, head over to our headquarters at Verkti Square.
I've been a merchant all my life. {nl}After Medzio Diena, this seemed like the safest place to be, so I settled here... {nl}But I guess I was wrong.
I've met many Revelators during my travels.{nl}In my opinion... there is something special about them, and it's not just their strength.
I'm not blaming the goddesses and the priests.{nl}But I think it's too much when they tell us to just trust them and wait.
The seals in the village are supposed to be sealed - that's why they're called seals, {nl}so what's the big deal? The priests are just trying to scare us for no reason.
The priests don't want everyone to know how important the seals in the village are.{nl}They think that they can just take the burden upon themselves, {nl}and then everything will be alright.
Some of the priests want to be truthful and open with the villagers.{nl}At this rate, if something really bad happens...
The evil energy is making this forest decay into a lifeless place.{nl}It is easily the biggest problem this village is facing.
Goddess...{nl}Please tell me the village's seal is really okay...
Demons will continue to target the seal and attack endlessly.{nl}With Goddess Austeja still missing, how long will we be able to last...
It was a mistake for us to try to handle this by ourselves.{nl}From now on, we will tell the villagers the whole truth and include them in a {nl}deliberate discussion on how to handle the matter.

Inspect the Detector
Talk to Kupole Meile
Talk to the Kupole whom you saved from the Petrifying Frost.
Examine the Petrification Detectors
Check the detectors in areas you haven't been to yet to help Kupole Meile guide the souls safely from the Petrifying Frost.
Return to Kupole Meile
You checked all 4 detectors except the one at the entrance. Now return to Kupole Meile.
You have something to say about reactivating the malfunctioning detector. Talk to Kupole Meile again.
Meet with Royal Army Guard Retia
Kupole said that the Royal Army installed the petrification detectors. Meet Royal Army Guard Retia at Verkti Square.
Talk some more with Royal Army Guard Retia about the malfunctioning detector at the Coastal Fortress.
Find a part for the petrification detector
Listen to Royal Army Guard Retia and look for the soldiers that were dispatched to the Coastal Fortress. If something has happened to them, you'll have to retrieve the part for the detector from their corpses. Also, try hunting the monsters in the area.
Meet with Kupole Meile
Unfortunately, the Royal Army soldiers did not survive, but you were able to collect all the necessary parts for the detector. Now, go tell Kupole what has happened, and then go repair the petrification detector.
Before you go to repair the petrification detector, talk to Kupole Meile about the situation at hand.
Repair the Petrification Detector
Repair the first petrification detector that wasn't working.
You have defeated all of the monsters that began to attack when you tried to repair the petrification detector. Now you can go back to repairing the petrification detector in peace.
Repair the Third Petrification Detector
Now go repair the third petrification detector.
Find Fastening String
You'll need some string to attach and secure the part to the detector. Try hunting some from monsters.
You have collected enough string to fasten the part. Now repair the third petrification detector.
Hunt monsters and collect %s
Hunt monsters and collect string
Go let Kupole Meile know that you have repaired all of the petrification detectors.
Examine the Mysterious Device
As you approach the unknown device, you feel strangely drawn to it and can't help but inch closer. What could this device be? Maybe you'd find out if you try touching it?
Find Svitrigaila
You begin to feel weaker and weaker, as if your soul is being drained from your body. Find someone who can help you out of this situation.
His Only Desire
Talk with Svitrigaila
It looks like you're going to have to listen to Svitrigaila's story.
Gather Poisonous Weeds
Svitrigaila tells you that, as a Revelator, it wouldn't be bad for you to help him commit suicide, and he asks you to gather some poisonous herbs for him.
Give Svitrigaila the Poisonous Herbs
You have gathered all of the poisonous herbs that Svitrigaila asked you to get. Now return to Svitrigaila and give him the poisonous herbs you've collected.
Talk to the Cleric Master to get the holy water that Svitrigaila needs.
Return to Svitrigaila
The Cleric Master stubbornly refused your request. That's unfortunate. Well anyhow, go tell Svitrigaila what happened.
You gave Svitrigaila the poisonous herbs, and it appears that he ate them, but you don't see any change in him. Try speaking to him again.
Seeing as there was no effect on Svitrigaila when he ate the poisonous herbs, it must be that he needs to mix them with holy water first, and then eat them to get the desired result. Find the Cleric Master and get the holy water from him.
Destroy the Terminal
Talk with Svitrigaila some more.
Destroy the Soul Compactor Terminal
In order to help Svitrigaila, you'll have to destroy the Soul Compaction Device. You'll need to gather some tools to help you destroy the Soul Compaction Device terminal, and then its the mainframe, beforehand. First things first, destroy the first terminal.
Inform Svitrigaila
You have destroyed the terminal. And you successfully retrieved the Terminal Core. Give the core to Svitrigaila.
Destroy the Terminal and retrieve its core
Ask Svitrigaila how to destroy the terminal in the next area.
Scrape off and collect Petrification Particles
According to Svitrigaila, you need to amplify the power of the explosive powder in order to destroy the next terminal, and for that, you'll need to scrape off and collect particles from petrified objects in this area.
Blow up the Terminal
Use the explosive powder Svitrigaila gave you and the petrification particles you collected to blow up the second terminal.
Ask Svitrigaila what you need to do to destroy the next terminal.
Destroy the Terminal
Svitrigaila says that the third terminal will get knocked out if anything comes near it. Retrieve the core from the petrified monsters nearby and throw it at the terminal to destroy it.
And Eternal Repose
Now that you've gotten rid of all the terminals, return to Svitrigaila.
Find materials to craft the Magic Orb
Svitrigaila gave you a manual to create a magic orb that can free the trapped souls from the Soul Compactor. Gather the necessary crafting materials that Svitrigaila  was unable to get from monsters and then use the manual to craft Svitrigaila's Orb.
Destroy the Soul Compactor
You have crafted Svitrigaila's Orb. Now take the orb to the Soul Compactor.
Destroy the Soul Compactor
Destroy the Soul Compactor with Svitrigaila's Orb.
Once you placed Svitrigaila's Orb, monsters started turning wild and rushing towards you! {nl}Fight off the monsters!
The Soul Compactor has been destroyed. Now return to Svitrigaila.
Say your final farewell to Svitrigaila
It looks like it's time to grant Svitrigaila's wish.
If you help me die, I'll release you from that curse.
Who cares what happens to this body that I can't move, or even escape from.{nl}I just want to rest a little.
You just need to gather the poisonous weeds from the area above us.
That area's known for its Bluebane...
Thank you. Let me try eating these one by one...
Just as I feared... I'm still here.{nl}I heard the Cleric Master has holy water that, when mixed with Bluebane, {nl}can easily kill any demon.
Cleric Master!{nl}Go to him and get some holy water.
Have a safe journey to Klaipeda.
...?{nl}The soulkeeper of Dingofasil District?{nl}Isn't he a demon?
Are you helping a demon?{nl}I won't pry into your personal affairs, but as a master serving the goddess, {nl}I cannot get involved in this. Please leave this place.
I will never involve myself in a demon's work.
I see... I should have expected that...{nl}I was a fool to hope otherwise.
If it comes down this, I guess I'll have to try that method now.{nl}Destroying the Soul Compactor that's here... The beings that sent me here told me.{nl}The Soul Compactor and I are one and the same. Why didn't I remember this until now?
Somewhere in this area is a Soul Compactor that absorbs human souls.{nl}It condenses their energy and uses it.{nl}This is a really suitable location for the Soul Compactor because, {nl}even after the Petrifying Frost blew through, it's still bustling with the activity of the {nl}Knights of Kaliss, grave robbers, and the soldiers of the Royal Army.
{nl}{nl}If I think about it, the beings that sent me here must have linked my life with the Soul Compactor so that I could collect souls for them forever. So if the Soul Compactor is destroyed, wouldn't I die with it?
The Soul Compactor has 3 terminals from which it absorbs souls.{nl}That bad feeling you had earlier was also a terminal trying to absorb your soul.{nl}For now, try to wipe out those terminals.
{nl}If you succeed in destroying a terminal, you should be able to retrieve its core.{nl}You need to collect those cores to craft an orb that will help you destroy the Soul Compactor.
Good job. This core will be used to make an orb that will overload the mainframe of the Soul Compactor.{nl}Now I can feel my death drawing near.
Try blowing up the second terminal.{nl}Here, I'll give you some explosives, but you'll need to scrape off some particles from petrified{nl}objects in this area to amplify the power of the explosives.{nl}Since the Petrifying Frost blows through here often, there are plenty of petrified objects {nl}everywhere.
Again, you'll need to retrieve the core from this terminal too.
Now there's only one terminal left... I feel myself getting weaker...{nl}The last terminal is probably short-circuiting.{nl}Try getting cores from petrified monsters in the area and throwing them at the terminal.{nl}That should be enough to make it collapse.
And of course, bring back the core from the last terminal.{nl}Condensed souls are concentrated within those cores... {nl}We just need to use them to craft an orb that will overload the Soul Compactor.
Now you've collected them all. Here, I'll give you the manual.{nl}Use this to craft the orb to overload the Soul Compactor.{nl}
I just want to rest...
Is this the last time? Really.
Let's see if we have all the detonators.
You've come... but it's already time for me to go.
I feel drained.
Yes. That's it. Give it to me.
Notice/!/When you touch the device, it feels like your soul is being drained!{nl}You must find someone who can fix this situation!
I'll cooperate
Relationship between the Spirit Integration Device and Svitrigaila
Perhaps your soul is draining, you are gradually losing energy and stamina!! Hurry and search for anyone who fix this situation!!
Obtain %s by destroying the Terminal
Bring the Terminal Core
Bring the Terminal Core to Svitrigaila.
Craft %s
As I expected, we have to get the Terminal Core again.{nl}Hmm... I'll cast a protection spell on you so the terminal won't defeat you like before.{nl}I have enough strength left for that, at least.
I guide petrified souls in accordance with the will of the goddess.
The Petrifying Frost will blow here soon. But we don't know when...{nl}I wonder if the Petrification Detector is working properly at Supply Route.{nl}Could you please check it?
Craft %s
They might get killed since there's no word from them.{nl}If you find their bodies... please bring them with their mementos.
Entire troops were killed. Thank you for the help.{nl}There should be a part in the mementos.
You need to move on to repair.{nl}Be careful of the Petrifying Frost.
Holy water?{nl}What do you need it for?
There is a demon who needs holy water at Dingofasil District?{nl}...
I won't concern myself with your personal matters, but I can't help demons as a cleric.
Maybe this is the only way...{nl}Destroying the Spirit Integration Device...{nl}The ones who sent me here told me that the Spirit Integration Device and I are one. {nl}{nl}How could I forget that?
The Spirit Integration Device absorbs souls from 3 terminals.{nl}The curse from a while ago was the process to absorb souls.{nl}Let's destroy the terminals one by one.
Then bring the core.{nl}Oh, I'll cast a spell on you so you won't be cursed again.
We should destroy the second terminal. {nl}I will give you some bombs, but to amplify the effects of the bombs, {nl}you will need some petrified water powder.
We should get the core of the terminal this time as well.{nl}Hmm... the spell has been released so that we won't get hurt by the spell. I will lock it again.
Here it is.{nl}The broken detector can be easily fixed with these parts.{nl}If the parts don't stay in place very well, get some strings from the nearby monsters and {nl}use them.
The repair, itself, isn't that hard. It is hard to obtain necessary parts.
You've come back from a long journey. So these are the parts.
Let's go repair it now.

Collect the corpses of the guards
By the words of the Royal Army Guard Retia, let's look for the other guards who had been {nl}dispatched to the Coastal Fortress. If they got into an accident, please collect their keepsakes. {nl}The monsters might have taken them so it would be a good idea to hunt for the monsters{nl}at the Coastal Fortress.
Return to Royal Army Guard Retia
The guards of the Royal Army have unfortunately died. {nl}You've collected their corpses so go back to Retia.
Since you've collected all the corpses of the guards who left to the Coastal Fortress to {nl}fix the detector, it seems that you will be able to obtain some parts of the detector from Retia. {nl}Talk with her.
Obtain some parts
Obtain some parts from Retia
Acquired some parts from Retia. Now, go back to Kupole Meile at the Coastal Fortress.

Revelator! Are you okay?{nl}The Petrifying Frost, it's really dangerous.{nl}
I am guiding the spirits that suffered from the Petrifying Frost long ago.{nl}
But the Petrifying Frost is the curse of the Demon Queen Gesti...{nl}It make us Kupoles turn into stone.{nl}
We should at least find out when the Petrifying Frost will blow.{nl}There are some petrification detectors which humans left behind, but some seem to be broken.{nl}Can you help me?
The detector you saw seems to be working well.{nl}Please look at how the other detectors are working.
The Petrifying Frost turns everything into stone. Even spirits.{nl}We, Kupoles, are no exception.
Ah, that's it.{nl}Two of them are broken.
We better ask about the soldiers who created the detectors about them.{nl}I heard the person named Retia is the officer so we may receive some help from her.  
He is at Verkti Square.{nl}Human matters cannot be resolved by the Kupoles, so we are counting on you.
Are you talking about the petrification detector at the Coastal Fortress?{nl}We are already aware of that.
It hasn't arrived yet? {nl}I've already dispatched the soldiers there.{nl}
I don't have a good feeling about this.{nl}Due to numerous monster attacks here, we don't have additional forces to send.{nl}Can I ask you to follow the guards who were dispatched for the repair?
Maybe they have been attacked at the Coastal Fortress.{nl}But, they are the guards of the kingdom. Their dead bodies should be brought here.
The Petrifying Frost is reported frequently at the entrance of the Coastal Fortress,{nl}so I think they will be around there. In case you find some corpses, please collect them.{nl}
I guess it was too late. Thanks for collecting the corpses.{nl}
Please come back after fixing the petrification detector.{nl}I have something to say.
I am counting on you to guide all the spirits to the goddesses.
Lastly, there's some story that they want to tell to the Revelator.{nl}You will want to know why humans are suffering from this.{nl}
The rumor that the Petrifying Frost is the sin of the revolt is just a made-up story.{nl}The curse came after the revolt so they may well think so.{nl}
No, however. {nl}Everything was their plot.
The ones who broke it first were the demons, however.{nl}That's the Petrifying Frost... they died and their spirits have become stone.{nl}
Demon Queen Gesti brought the curse of the petrification on this land,{nl}and the goddesses tried to save the humans. But, the demons asked us whether {nl}we had forgotten not to interfere with each other's matters and...{nl}
Wait. This memory is too horrible..{nl}A horrible catastrophe has landed.{nl}
Like a big disaster that the goddess might abandon to save this petrified place.{nl}The Petrifying Frost... All of that... This is what we must suffer through to save that which {nl}we abandoned.
I will try to save the spirits from now on.{nl}Since you fixed all the detectors, we will be able to guide the spirits to eternal sleep.
We will do our best to guide each and every one of them.{nl}I hope the goddesses bless you.
I guess you can't trust me since a demon like me is asking you a favor.{nl}But, look at me closely. It doesn't matter if you laugh at me.{nl}
I've tried my best to escape for hundreds of years.{nl}But, the curse of the petrification is the power of the Demon Queen. {nl}This endless depression is suffocating me.{nl}
Even if you escape, you're still a traitor.{nl}You'll be called a "traitor" while at the feet of the colleagues who mocked you...{nl}
If you cooperate towards my death, I will definitely remove your curse.{nl}I promise in the name of Giltine.
It doesn't matter what happens to my body.{nl}I just want to rest...
The poisonous plant that grows up there would be able to take my life away.
I will pray that a plant that is poisonous to humans brings me eternal rest.
Thanks. Now, I will pray for the end of my agonizing life.
So nothing occurs as I expected.{nl}If that's the case... We can't say we are in distress. We just have to rely on the one{nl}that we demons want to eliminate.
Please bring the holy water from the one who follows the call of the goddesses.{nl}That sacred power will lead me to death.
I heard the Cleric Master handles the holy water.{nl}I don't know if he's going to give me any.
Are you talking about holy water?{nl}I am sorry, but may I ask you where you are going to use it.
There are demons who need the holy water?{nl}I am sorry, but I can't help you.{nl}
I am not going to be involved in your personal matter.{nl}No matter what the reasons are, I can't help a demons' matters as a priest.
As a priest, I can't cooperate on the tasks of the demons.{nl}I hope you understand this as well.
So... that's it.{nl}Maybe, we came to expect something that we shouldn't expect.
The people who I believed to be my colleagues betrayed me. {nl}Then, there is no reason for me to hold on to this.{nl}
The Demon Lord has ordered me to collect the spirits of humans that will be dedicated to God.{nl}That's why we began working on creating the integrator which would collect the spirits.{nl}
The process was smooth, but I suffered from the curse of the Petrifying Frost.{nl}Frozen freak, they said while laughing.{nl}
That I will be the soure of magic of the integrator.{nl}How did I come to forget this...
You must know by now.{nl}The curse that has been put on the barrier stone... we use it to pull spirits from humans.{nl}
The spirits that were pulled will be gathered to the integrator and dedicated to the god.{nl}The god... it is like me.
The integrator is being protected by three barrier stones.{nl}Destroy the barrier stones down there and obtain the cores from them.{nl}
I will cast a spell on you so that you won't get cursed again.{nl}The integrator moves by consuming my vitality so it's easy for me. 
The guys who abandoned me and laughed at me can't be called our colleagues.{nl}I will get my revenge by killing them. I will make them regret that they treated me {nl}like a source of magic.
Well done. My death is near.
The next barrier stone is up there. {nl}We have to put in great power all at once. Like an explosion.{nl}
Okay... there was a grave robber among the ones who were sacrificed.{nl}I tried to lead myself into death using a bomb, but it was useless.
We should not forget about the core of the barrier stone.{nl}To avoid being cursed again, I will cast a spell.
How come I never thought about this.{nl}Maybe my loyalty has surpassed the fear of loneliness.
The last barrier stone must be exploding by now.{nl}
As the monsters were being petrified, their last breaths were also solidified... {nl}Throw those against barrier stones.{nl}They will gradually collapse.
The core of the barrier stone is composed of condensed spirits.{nl}We will make orbs by collecting those that would destroy the integrator.
I will put the last of my power into the cores of the barrier stones which you've collected.{nl}Pull out monsters' detonators with this and make an orb.{nl}
Of course, I will give you a method to make the orb.{nl}The orb that would destroy the integrator.{nl}
And, please fulfill my last wish.
I've handed over the method to make the orb with my power.{nl}It will be easy to make an orb.
Succeeded...{nl}
Do you know the meaning of the name Giltine?{nl}Her name means death. The only thing that I can rely on at the moment.
I once thought that I didn't care what I turn myself into if it was for the demons long ago.{nl}But, only the Petrifying Frost blew to me.{nl}
I started to slowly harden over hundreds of years.{nl}My name has been erased from everyone's minds.{nl}
Even if she doesn't bring me eternal rest, it will be better than now.{nl}I just want to rest...
Death is coming to me.{nl}I feel good.
Yes. That's it. Give it to me.
Within the keepsakes you've found for me...{nl}There must be some parts that will fix the detector at the Coastal Fortress.{nl}
Here it is. {nl}The repair shouldn't be that hard.
The Royal Army was taught that they should be loyal and honorable to the kingdom.{nl}And to be committed to due diligence when engaging in their duties.
You came back a long way.{nl}So these are the parts to fix the petrification detector.
It must have been hard to obtain the parts, but the repair itself shouldn't be that hard.{nl}Let's return.
Pillar
(It seems like something is written on the pillar.)
(It seems that some letters are visible, but I can't clearly see them.)
To be able to read the letters, you must have a piece of the symbol.
{nl}You can obtain the piece of the symbol somewhere in Galeed Plateau.
(Something is written, but is not legible.)
(It seems that something is written on it, but it can't be read in this condition.)
That ring was given to me by my mother.{nl}I want to go back home with it, back to where my mother is...
Our house is in the inner castle district...{nl}Please... I want to go back home with the ring...
Yes. Gailus Legwyn is my old friend...{nl}But even an old friend shouldn't just take a precious object and not return it.{nl}
If her father is dead, then she should pay for the debt!{nl}Besides, I didn't even see that lady named Justina.{nl}
I don't care who she is. It doesn't matter as long as she brings back my object.{nl}I don't care if that woman really is his daughter or not.
I'm not doing any more trades.{nl}Why do I have to experience this kind of shame?
I want to see Justina...
I feel like I age a hundred years whenever I deal with Pardoners.
If I can get back what's mine, I won't return to this place.{nl}His daughter is a successful woman, so she can take care of it.{nl}You better not get involved with these guys.
Mesafasla Assistant Commander Gomen
This place is a military strategic point and it is also a dangerous area.{nl}You should be careful.
It is hard to maintain the army after the supplies stopped coming from the lower land.{nl}The problem is that the circumstances down there are more severe.
We better do our duty fast...{nl}We just have to hang tight a little longer...{nl}
I am not sure how to return to the army.
Soldier Baskez
It will be our end if we sleep here.{nl}We better move our unit a little bit.
We are going to freeze to death instead of dying from hunger.{nl}Are there any better options?
Thank you so much for saving me last time.{nl}I want to help you, but I am tied to the army...
This place is too cold.{nl}You can clearly see that I can't even move my neck an inch.
Military Courier Rochez
I have an important duty to do, but those guys are troubling me.
Mesafasla is suffering because of the monsters, though this place is also harsh.
I was able to return to the army because of you. Thanks.
I don't know why I volunteered myself to be a military courier.{nl}My tasks are becoming harder ever since the monsters went crazy.
Supply Officer Ronda
Supplies are running out, but we still have many people.{nl}You know, I actually rather wish that they would all run away.
We get some supplies from hunting the monsters nearby... It's not enough, though...
There are some potatoes that are growing at Skaika Supply Route.{nl}It's not hard to pick them up...{nl}
I am the only supply officer on duty, so I don't have time to pick those potatoes.{nl}If by any chance you visit that place, I would appreciate if you got me some potatoes.
I feel embarassed to have asked you this...{nl}I'm sorry, but I don't have any other choice.
I won't have any strength to fight by just eating meat.{nl}Everyone knows it's important to eat a variety of food.
Since this place is colder than other areas, it is important to consume nutritious food.{nl}As a supply officer, I am having a hard time.
An outsider is better at going down the mountains.{nl}You will either freeze to death or die from hunger.
Although the kingdom has become famous, we are still soldiers.{nl}This is a military zone. Please leave you are not an official.
I heard that this place was used as a workshop.{nl}We are able to find old materials easily, but the problem is the food shortage.
I am worried since the number of my men who are running away is increasing.{nl}Our supplies will last longer, but I am worried that I may become the only one left.
Injured People in the Tent
Rrr... Master...{nl}The pain is too much for me...
Mom... I miss you... Urgg...
Mage Horace
Thanks for saving me.{nl}But, if we don't act now, we won't be able to hold out much longer.
I am still an apprentice, so there isn't much I can do.{nl}I'd have to utilize my knowledge that I gained from reading books.
Soldier Motimer
If he didn't have a firm control on the workshop's warehouse, {nl}we wouldn't have suffered so much.
Are they suffering like us because of the monsters down there?
Where has Goddess Zemyna gone to...
We came this far so it must not be wrong.

You were able to escape safely from the Petrifying Frost thanks to Kupole Meile. {nl}Talk with Kupole Meile.
In order for Kupole Meile to guide the spirits safely from the Petrifying Frost, {nl}check all the detectors that you haven't been to in this region.
Discuss the circumstances with Kupole Meile
You've checked all four detectors except for the detector at the entrance. {nl}Now, go back to Kupole Meile and tell her about the circumstances.
It seems that Kupole Meile will be able to guide the spirits safely after repairing the detector. {nl}Talk with Kupole Meile again.

That ring was given to me by my mom. {nl}She told me to help Ruklys and win.{nl}
Although Ruklys has passed away, this long lasting war doesn't look like it's going to end.{nl}He... Where is Eminent?{nl}
I don't care what happens now.{nl}I want to return to the house where my mom is with this ring.
Examining the Soldier's Grave
Let's help
Putting down the ring
Examine the Soldier's Grave
There is a grave of a soldier that looks very old. Take a look at it.
Defeat the resentment that rushed in
Suddenly a monster came to attack the soldier's spirit. You better destroy it.
The Resentful Soldier's Spirit seems to be somewhat calm. {nl}Talk with the Resentful Soldier's Spirit.
The spirit seems to have some story. Talk with the Resentful Soldier's Spirit.
The Resentful Soldier's Spirit wants to go back to the house where his mother is with the ring. Go to the soldier's house which is located inside the castle walls with the ring.
This city... is very sad.{nl}I am guiding the spirits that were attacked by the {nl}Petrifying Frost with the wishes of the goddesses.
The sound of sighs from the spirits that weren't able to {nl}go near the goddesses breaks my heart.
(It seems that something is written on it.)
(It seems that something is written on it, but you can't see it clearly due to a shadow.){nl}
(If I can get something that shines brightly, will I be able to read what's written on it?)
(You can see a hole which you can insert something into.){nl}
(Are we going to look for it somewhere around here?)
(Something is written on it, but it is too vague.)
(Something is written on it, but you can't see it clearly.)
If you meet someone who is related to the kingdom, please tell him this.{nl}We are still diligently working on our duties.{nl}
May the goddesses protect you.
You are a rude, arrogant man.{nl}I suffered a loss, why can't you understand this?
You are a shameless swindler.{nl}I don't know why Justina's father has a friend like him.
It is so fortunate that we found the Justina's family treasures.{nl}However I have a few things to say to that Pardoner!
Who really was that girl.{nl}Justina though... should we tell her the truth?.
Be careful. Soon, the Petrifying Frost will blow. {nl}But, we don't know when...{nl}
Is the detector at the supply route working alright?
We may receive some help from Retia at Verkti Square.{nl}It's hard for us, Kupoles, to be related in human matters so I am counting on you.
We've already given up one salvation, and we couldn't do anything on Medzio Diena.{nl}We can't give up anymore.
Are you the Revelator?{nl}
That's sad. So sad.{nl}You are like me. They can't get out of it even if they are tied up.
Don't be afraid.{nl}I can't hurt you and you can't hurt me.
If your friend really is a Bokor, he might be able to identify {nl}the true nature of that sacred object.{nl}I want to find out what this is.
The Order of the Tree of Truth went into Carlyle's Mausoleum.{nl}Be careful. They're not crazy as you might think.
They are making fun of it by using the name of the goddesses. {nl}They shouldn't insult the dead like this.{nl}
We want to find that regious body and punish them... {nl}The eternal rest of the deads is the first thing that we should do.
Margiris is on the way to Carlyle's Mausoleum.{nl}If you take the proof of the truth I gave to you to Margiris,{nl}he will acknowledge your achievements.
Margiris is one of the greatest leaders in our Order.{nl}He is the one who raised me.
The Order of the Tree of Truth has already relieved {nl}the spirits whose bodies have rotted away.{nl}Relieve the sins of Carlyle. {nl}
The documents with his sins written on it would lead his spirit to the Divine Tree.
Carlyle is a sinful spirit.{nl}Similarly sinful spirits will soon become one with the Divine Tree.
Damn, what was that explosion?
Suddenly, an explosion was heard from somewhere and the monsters started to go crazy.{nl}You didn't cause those, right?
Thank you so much for helping me back then.{nl}But, an outsider should not enter this place.
Originally outsiders were chased out of here...{nl}Since Delus needs your help, theres nothing we can do.
The monsters suddenly rushed out so we lost the post and many of our colleagues were hurt.{nl}There hasn't been anything like this before...
While I was protecting the Fortress of the Land, this thing never occurred even once.{nl}I was scouted as an elite from my kingdom, but my pride was hurt.
This is the first time that I receive help from outsiders.{nl}We have to drive them out, but I don't know how I can accept this...
Delus must have some ideas.{nl}Thanks for saving me, but I don't know what I should do in this situation.
If I take little more rest, I can move fast.{nl}I can fight little more even if I don't receive help from you.
Are the guys at the outpost really patrolling?{nl}Letting in an outsider... I say you don't need any help.
I know that you've saved me. However, an outsider is an outsider.{nl}I don't know what Delus is thinking, but please leave quickly.
If I a get little more rest, this wound will be fine.{nl}I don't need your help so please go after you finish the task Delus requested.
We are ready to charge into the enemy's position.{nl}If you're scared, you better back out.
Now is the time to get our revenge on those guys.{nl}We will charge in as soon as we receive the order!
I was careless due to the sudden attack.{nl}I am not scared of those kind of monsters!
My injuries don't hurt much now that I've gotten enough rest.{nl}I just want to reclaim the outpost quickly!
We can reclaim the outpost ourselves without your help.{nl}I don't know what Delus is worried about.
If we begin to think about losing, then we will lose.{nl}We are going reclaim the outpost!
I am waiting for Delus' orders.{nl}Now is the time to get our revenge!
I am not going to lose the outpost again.{nl}For the honor of the Royal Army!
You fight better than I expected.{nl}I'm a bit surprised.
I feel good, but I also feel uncomfortable since we've received help from an outsider.{nl}Now, please get going.
Delus said he won't ask why you came here so we aren't going to say anything.{nl}However please leave now since we've reclaimed the outpost.
It starts now.{nl}We can't be relaxed since we don't know when they will come again.
Outsiders are forbidden to enter this place due to the king's command.{nl}We really appreciate for your help, but there is nothing we can about it.{nl}
Now, you better go to the outpost area.{nl}Or how long are you planning to stay at the Fortress of the Land?
That outpost was to be recovered without your help.{nl}However, you fought well.
We are not going to lose the outpost anymore.{nl}There won't be anymore instances where we would receive help from an {nl}outsider like you again.
I'm thinking of suggesting plans to Delus about strengthening our outpost.{nl}I don't want to experience such shames again.
I can't just sit around forever.{nl}All because we don't know when the monsters will attack again while having to {nl}block outsiders like you.
Damn, theres nothing we can do.{nl}We better just follow their instructions for now.
That thing is giving me a headache.{nl}However, I can't just leave someone who is in danger.
Those soldiers just don't listen to us.{nl}We've helped them so far, are they just going to cast us away?
I've listened to him as much as I can... now what do we do?
My god... How could this happen...{nl}
No. We should get a grip on ourselves. {nl}We would have never entered here if we were going to lose our energy like this.{nl}Let's enter the portal for now.
What is this terrible curse?{nl}And that demon earlier... What the hell is going on here?{nl}
Although I've seen the Petrifying Frost many times, {nl}seeing something like this for the first time was really surprising.{nl}Let's get in the portal for now. We can't stop for things like this.
It was something ridiculously huge and powerful.{nl}I'm sure this time.
That was a fearful amount of power.{nl}What is this Monocle seeing...
Don't forget to leave a message about creating a verification ticket.{nl}If you don't have that then I'll have to pointlessly wait for you.
Please get the attention of that old man.{nl}I have something else I'd like to know. {nl}
Let's go our separate ways, but we'll keep in touch. Alright?
You told me that you will meet someone called Eminent at the battlefield right?{nl}Let's go together. We'll be sure when we see the Monocle.
The person who used to live 600 years ago may be alive? and He has allied with demons?{nl}These facts are so unbelievable that its giving me a headache.
Just listen to whatever Eminent has to say for now.{nl}Then we'll meet at the Paramiso Battle Field in secret. Okay?
I'm really glad Eminent doesn't know that I'm here.{nl}I will prepare it so please don't forget to come to Paramiso Battle Field.
Me? I'm about to start my work.{nl}We've found some clues so we should be able to find it quickly.{nl}
Thanks to Eminent, we found a lot of things that the Knights of Kaliss may like.{nl}I haven't gotten my share yet, so I'll stay here little longer.
We should retreat...{nl}Or else we'll get wiped out...
Come blow the horn to retreat...
We need to destroy all these tombstones.{nl}Now, we should stop looking for the goddesses and look at the reality.
That's disgusting. There must be more people who've crossed paths with these hooligans.{nl}They're not trying to use brute force, but rather take it apart from the inside...
The demon's control over the area is getting weaker.{nl}No, it's not prominent, but I smell something very dangerous.
Unless we hear from Damiyonas again, we'll be stopping here.{nl}Don't break the tombstones anymore.
When someone has an emptiness in their heart,{nl}it makes it very easy for evil to force themselves in.{nl}To prevent this you must have strong faith.
That's really creepy.{nl}Now those demons are blending in with the humans and causing trouble...
Next time, don't ever destroy the tombstones. {nl}How were these tombstones even created...
We should look for another way while we wait for Fabijus.{nl}Can you ask Barte for me?
I've heard the name Albinas before.{nl}Moreover, Nestoses and Anstoses still respect each other.
Fabijus...{nl}I hope nothing happens to him...
Nestoses knows how to face the demons.{nl}If you explain your situation, he'll help for sure!
It would have been really dangerous without you.{nl}Demons... If we don't get any help we won't be able to advance from my position.
The symbol of Baiga, that symbol is being used by the demons' minions.{nl}I've never seen any human use that symbol.
The demons among the humans, what can we rely on now?{nl}What can we trust outside of the goddesses...
Have you ever seen the Great Cathedral or the Mage Tower before?{nl}How about a gigantic goddess statue like the one in Fedimian.{nl}
Do you think construction of that size can be completed by one individual?{nl}Of course not. Even if the kingdom does it, it's going to be difficult acquiring all the materials.
There's a famous merchants' organization that used to supply the {nl}materials of the great construction
Until now, we've been secretly helping the kingdom in the shadows {nl}in the name of the goddesses...{nl}From now on, we are going to help the world as much as we can.
Well, now that we've been revealed, it will be nothing but awful and tough times ahead.{nl}Such as becoming a target of the demons, for example.{nl}
However that's a common thing. We've done it once in danger before.{nl}Let's do well comrades, for the goddess.
The rest can be easily done, so we'll take care of it.{nl}Thank you for helping me so far.
There are lots of objects to retrieve here, aside from Manahas.{nl}Some objects should not fall into the hands of demons so I am worried.
There will be more newcomers from now on, so I am planning to make more manuals.{nl}We've obtained all we could so we don't have to worry anymore.
It's good that the merchants are coming out to the world, {nl}but I am not sure if they would be able to keep their lives.{nl}But, even so, we are not doing something that we are not familiar with so it doesn't matter.{nl}
The kingdom hasn't been fallen to the demons yet.{nl}If we do our best, we will find peace again.
The rest of the work is in Orsha.{nl}Thank you so much for helping me.
Nestoses are making tombstones without countermeasures.{nl}When the corrupted tombstones are corrupted, it'll start attracting monsters too.
That's not us, and I am sure there isn't such name in Anastoses.{nl}Though, who is Albinas anyways?
She is so disgraceful. The woman named Albinas...{nl}I don't know why she broke the tombstone.
We were making a tombstone that would help the goddesses.{nl}We are going to collect the sacred energy and {nl}send it to the goddesses through the tombstone.
We're going to collapse easily if we don't have something to rely on.{nl}That's why the belief of the goddesses is more important.
I don't have any energy.{nl}I am investigating about the differences in views between Nestoses and Anastoses... {nl}I miss my research room.
There is only one belief, but the views can be diverse.{nl}Like Nestoses and Anastoses there.{nl}
Even so, this won't cause a big difference or an argument.
I am on a pilgrimage to the former kingdom.{nl}I recently arrived to this camp.
When I first started my pilgrimage, I would hear the sounds of sighs wherever I go...{nl}It seems things look a little more hopeful now thanks to the reveletors.
Everyone misses the peaceful world four years ago.{nl}Anastoses told us that we should look more into reality if we want to go back to those days.
If we don't believe in the goddesses, then who else is going to trust the goddesses.{nl}Us Nestoses think this is the reality.
Are you the one who broke the tombstone?{nl}Is it really...
I've heard that the demons are impersonating Anastoses.{nl}But, we are not going to argue for such matters.
We Anastoses are focusing more on the realities than Nestoses.{nl}We can't just do nothing while waiting for the goddesses.{nl}
However we all serve the goddesses and focus on our faith.{nl}That's why we are on our pilgrimage.
It was so scary when Albinas turned into a Fire Lord and started to attack me.{nl}Thank you so much for helping us returning to the camp.
Kedora Merchants welcome you.{nl}If you have anything to ask, come to me anytime!
Ah, is this the first time you've seen our merchants?{nl}I fully understand. It's because we've only done our business in secret.{nl}
More details can be heard from Leopoldas.{nl}I'm very busy so I will take my leave...
We, of the Kedora Merchant Alliance, follow the will of the goddesses, {nl}but we only acted behind the scenes.{nl}Now that the world is in chaos, we can't just stand still.{nl}
That's why we've decided to be more engaged in it.{nl}Even if we become a target of the demons.
We, of the Kedora Merchant Alliance, will actively recruit newcomers.{nl}Are you interested?
There are many things to learn since we are still newcomers.{nl}Although, Leopoldas only insists on the pride...
There are still many notice boards to set, but I can do the rest myself.{nl}I can do it. Probably...
I am a newcomer of the Kedora Merchant Alliance. I will serve them well!{nl}I decided to join as soon as I heard that the Kedora Merchant Alliance {nl}was recruiting newcomers.
It is my duty to help the Revelators in the name of the Kedora Merchant Alliance.{nl}From now on, I will be keep doing this task until I become more experienced.
Collection Member
The Kedora Merchant Alliance is retrieving the objects that were lost on Medzio Diena.{nl}Jurate is in charge of this.
Record Member
I do all the work related to the Kedora Merchant Alliance records.{nl}Such as identifying the quantities of the things that need to be recorded.
I am managing the manuals that will be used to teach the newcomers.{nl}This too, is part of the Kedora Merchant Alliance records.
I am praying all the time for the return of the goddesses.{nl}Although I am old, I am trying to do everythig I can.
I've never heard of it, but it doesn't matter that much.{nl}They concentrate on their religious belief quietly.
I couldn't stand anymore so I came out to look for the materials of the scriptures.{nl}The goddesses would... come back one day right?
I want to go back to Fasika Plateau fast after finding what I lost...
When I talk to him, I feel like I'm aging 100 years.{nl}I don't know what to say.
If I only got mine back, I would've never come back here.{nl}He can go do whatever he wants since his daughter's career is so successful!{nl}
You better not get involved with those guys.
This is a strategic military point and it is a dangerous place.{nl}You better be cautious.
After the supplies stopped coming from the mountain below, {nl}it became harder to maintain the army.{nl}However, the bigger problem is that the situation down there seem worse.
We better get to our mission fast...{nl}Just a little bit more...
It is so freezing cold.{nl}I am not sure how long we can stand...
This will be the end if we fall asleep here.{nl}We better move our bodies constantly.
We do our task everyday amidst life and death.{nl}But, if I hadn't met you today... I can only say that I was lucky.
The unfinished mission is still bothering me.{nl}The assistant commander says it's okay, but I don't think it is.
Shh, please lower your voice.{nl}I'm hiding to avoid getting detected by monsters.
If I take a quick rest, I should be able to move out...{nl}What to do with this letter...
I was able to complete the mission and return to the camp safely.{nl}I knew the goddesses haven't abandoned me yet.
I don't know why I applied to become a messenger.{nl}Regardless of the weather, the monsters are going crazy so my task is getting harder.
The supplies are running out, but I haven't received any contact from the kingdom yet.{nl}But, since I am a supply officer, I am thinking how we would endure more.
We're really lacking a lot. In everything.{nl}Although, we are self-sufficient enough from hunting monsters nearby...
Oh, I shouldn't think about negative things.
Civilians better go down the mountains.{nl}If they stay here, they would either die of hunger or freeze to death.
Although the kingdom has become ineffective, we are still soldiers.{nl}This is a military zone and if you are not related to the military, please leave.
Thanks to you, Horace's condition has improved.{nl}I hope he can relax a bit now.
Although orders from the kingdom have stopped, {nl}we are staying here because we are soldiers.{nl}The same holds true for Horace. {nl}
If someone doesn't do it, the kingdom will collapse.{nl}Our homes too, there will be no one left to protect our families.
I thought... I was going to enter the goddesses' embrace.{nl}
Though, I learned something as a result.{nl}Some things that the monsters eat aren't always edible.
I'm planning to stay here until I receive contact from the kingdom.{nl}We need to rely on each other despite being cornered so the soldiers won't give up.
Although this place is known as an important strategic military point, {nl}there are not many soldiers around.{nl}This place is that harsh.
This place used to be a forced labor camp.{nl}I don't know how people worked in this extreme cold, {nl}but I personally would have survived well.
I've come here after hearing that the goddesses blessed the Order of the Tree of Truth...{nl}Though I only see the dead.
I thought I would be able to find out the whereabouts of Goddess Zemyna, {nl}but this place is full of the dead...{nl}I've never seen something like this. We have to hurry and meet with Zemyna.
The dead have suddenly risen.{nl}The Bokor is going around destroying the coffins. What the hell is going on...
I've never seen this in my life.{nl}It was such a chaos on Medzio Diena, but those dead as well?{nl}It can't be...
I think those people in the Order are all scammers.{nl}I am certain that Zemyna would've never blessed this church.
Those people went crazy on the graves...{nl}I'm very embarassed to see Sigis.
The Divine Tree is not a symbol of disaster.{nl}It is the symbol of the great determination that will save us all.
There will soon be a day where you will recognize the grace of the Divine Tree.{nl}How about you join the Order of the Tree of Truth?
Ahh... I... could not be saved...
I was foolish... I was really foolish...
Do you believe in salvation?
Those who believe in the goddesses are fools. {nl}The Divine Tree, which still stands in the kingdom's capital, will save you.
You should't want salvation that easily.{nl}Think about what you've done for the Divine Tree before you {nl}request something from the Divine Tree.
The act of awakening the dead and disturbing their eternal rest is what they call the truth?
While I was alive, I managed the lands of the kingdom, {nl}yet they called me someone guilty of high treason.
Ayaya... The claws of those ferrets are so sharp...
The villagers here are not fond of outsiders.{nl}Would it be better to not ask for their favor?
I've never seen you before... Who are you?
The Revelator from the folklore has appeared to save us...{nl}Thank you... Everyone was waiting for you...
Uh-huh... Why are you still here...?{nl}You better not miss the girl.{nl}Go after her.
Who are you? I've never seen you around here.{nl}Even with just the village men it's tiring,{nl}if you don't have anything to do can you tell them to stop talking...?
Oh! The Revelator...{nl}It is so good to see you.{nl}Please take care of the village...
Let's go see if those ferrets ate the beef jerky...{nl}Would it be dangerous?{nl}I am curious...
Who are you? Is this your first time here?{nl}Have you gotten the permission from the village headman?    
The Revelator from folklore...{nl}I've heard it from the village priest. You saved him using some kind of light, right?{nl}That light... I want to see it one day too!
Ah... After setting up the sculpture, those ferrets became more violent?{nl}That's probably because the sculpture wasn't completed yet...{nl}My apologies Widas...
Oh... Hello...{nl}I am sorry... but if you don't have any business here please leave now...{nl}Right now, the atmosphere in this town is bad...
Revelator! Are you the Revelator from folklore who will save the village with the light?{nl}I saw it. Your splendid light...{nl}If it wasn't for that light, I would have already been attacked by those ferrets.{nl}Thank you so much.
Great Priest of the Village
What... If you don't have any business here, please go back...{nl}This village is already done for...
Revelator... Revelator... No... our village is already done...{nl}You came too late... it won't make any difference now...{nl}Our village was already done for when Goddess Lada was captured...
...No... This isn't it...
It's so good to hear that you've come here to save the village.{nl}Welcome. I am Dievdirbys Widas.{nl}I am creating sculptures to turn those ferrets back to what they used to be.
The ferrets have become more violent... I feel like I've made demonic totems...{nl}I guess I better create new ones from scratch...
Uh? Revelator... Why did you arrive so early...{nl}I will take a look at this place, so please help the villagers first.
Please follow the girl and save the villagers and Goddess Lada...
I knew that you could do it!{nl}Thank you. Thank you so much.{nl}I want to thank Goddess Laima who guided you to this place.
Thank you for saving this village.{nl}However, since those ferrets are still going crazy, I better make the sculpture quickly.
Thank you for saving the village and Goddess Lada.
That is so amazing that you managed to defeat the Demon Lord!{nl}Because of you, the ferrets won't steal our food anymore.{nl}Thank you.
Thanks. I am grateful of Goddess Laima who has brought you here.{nl}You are a blessing to our village.
I hope those ferrets get a hold of themselves soon...
If those ferrets are attacking us with that in mind...{nl}We wouldn't need to fight... Right?
Thank you for saving this village.{nl}You have defeated the Demon Lord and rescued the goddess.{nl}Now, we can concentrate on the ferrets.{nl}I thank you from the bottom of my heart for reducing the worries of this village.
Thank you for defeating the Demon Lord and saving the goddess.
Since the goddesses have come back now, we can rebuild the shrine with our villagers.
Thank you for resolving the village's disaster.{nl}I underestimated you... and for that, I apologize...
As Goddess Laima foretold, you've saved our village... {nl}Thank you... Really, thank you...
Dear Savior... I've heard that you helped the villagers while {nl}I was captured by the Demon Lord.{nl}You've completed a task that I was supposed to do...{nl}Thank you very much.
Savior... The future of this world depends on the path you take from here on.{nl}Go... Walk the way of salvation by following the revelation of Laima...
Patient in the Tent
Hurk... Don't talk to me.{nl}I feel like throwing up...
I shouldn't lie around in a time like this...
Of course I won!{nl}However, I said I dropped the necklace I recieved as evidence from the guy into the sea.{nl}
Back then, I gave up because the sea was too deep...{nl}Even now I'm not sure if I can still find it.
If I can find it, I think I will be able to deal a blow to those who says I am a bluff.{nl}It's near Kranto Coast. I recognized you as a Corsair, so you should be able to find it quickly.
A Centurion knows how to dedicate himself for the kingdom...{nl}He should know its honor.{nl}
I am looking for the flags of a few soldiers who were annihilated on Medzio Diena.{nl}I want you to help me with this, for the honor of these soldiers.
I've heard that there were soldiers who lost contact at the Drill Ground of Confliction{nl}on Medzio Diena. We didn't expect them to be alive though...{nl}
At least we will be able to remember the dedicated loyalty the army had towards the kingdom.
If you are a Doppelsoeldner, there is a task that you should do for the kingdom.{nl}
I want to do it myself, but I'm doing some quiet work. {nl}I will be spotted easily.
I appreciate you telling me that. {nl}Please look for Commander Ramin's delegate secretly. {nl}
The last contact we had was receieved from Fasika Plateau.
That's so unfortunate. They've probably been attacked by the demons.{nl}Anyways, you have all of my support now that you've {nl}become a valuable member of the Doppelsoeldners.
Ah, please keep this a secret from the others.{nl}I will find another way to contact General Ramin.
It is recorded. {nl}This is good, I will pass this to Vaidotas.{nl}
It is my turn to help you.
I don't know why, but there is a strong grudge swirling at Videntis Shrine.{nl}If you could get me that, I will lead you to a higher level.
Ah, you've arrived at a good time.{nl}I am investigating the Crystal Mine, but the toxic gas is leaking out again.{nl}
Good.{nl}Let's first create the neutralizer to neutralize the toxic gas.{nl}
First, I need you to get me the materials so we can prepare it.{nl}I'll write down the necessary materials and where you cand find them.
This will be enough.{nl}We were able to finish this quickly because of your help.{nl}
It will take some time before we can extract the substances...{nl}In the meantime, I will teach you alchemy.
You're here. Good.{nl}The last stage to becoming a Rogue... This is what you really want, right?{nl}
To prove your skills as a Rogue...{nl}I have an idea that will also solve my problem.{nl}
The Scout Master and I used be the best friends.{nl}However, our relationship now is not as close as it used to be.
In an effort to become closer, I want to give him a present...{nl}I want to give something that the Scout Master likes.{nl}
Are you prepared for what I am going to request of you?
Good! Get me some pieces with floral fragrances on it from monsters at Alemeth Forest.{nl}All you have to do is secretly put those pieces into this pocket.{nl}
However, what if the monsters die...{nl}Unfavorable scents may get mixed unless you pull them out when they are alive.{nl}
To give you a little hint, this is something you do behind their backs.{nl}Understood?
You've collected enough of them as expected.{nl}By fulfilling this request, I can tell that you won't have a problem learning the last skill.
There are many people who have the same level of competence as you...{nl}
Well, alright.{nl}Though, you need to understand that this will be very difficult for you {nl}if you want to learn this at your current level.{nl}
I've been searching for the arrows that the first Fletcher Master created a long time ago.{nl}Those arrows were given to Lydia Schaffen as a present.{nl}I think they contain some sort of advanced technology.
Recently, I've obtained useful information about the whereabouts of those arrows...{nl}There is a person who is able to identify the true value of those arrows.{nl}
I've heard they were at Galeed Plateau.{nl}However, they were used when facing some violent monster, so be careful.
Oh. I've only seen it for a short period of time, but I can tell how amazing it is.{nl}I want to do some research on this arrow immediately, {nl}but I've made a promise with you, so that's the first thing I'm going to do.{nl}
Okay... Let's get started.
As a Falconer Master, I am always looking at different options to make Falconers stronger.{nl}Recently, I've been thinking how I can make those flying monsters of use to us.{nl}
Of course I am satisfied with my partner, Rith..{nl}I think these attempts are helpful to Falconers.
When we tame a hawk, maybe we should feed it something?{nl}I don't have high expectations, but we better go there and try it.{nl}
I've placed some food for you to try it on at least three different types of monsters.
Did we fail... {nl}I expected it though.{nl}
Regardless of the result, I should reward you for your effort.{nl}The biggest reward I can give to you would be teaching you new skills.{nl}What do you think?
Shoot at an enemy and hit it...{nl}That's one of the basics of a Schwarzer Reiter.{nl}
So you want to learn new skills, huh? {nl}Hitting an enemy with our eyes closed? How does that sound?
Hahaha. However, we aren't blind. {nl}We shouldn't go that far, right?{nl}
I'm liking your confidence!{nl}I like it so much that we're going to put it to the test.
Your objective is to accurately hit the targets multiple times.{nl}If you're able to do that, I will acknowledge your skills.{nl}So... I'd say about 200 times? Personally I think thats quite easy.
I knew it wasn't a bluff! It was the confidence, am I right?!{nl}As promised, I will gladly become your teacher.
The way of a true Monk...{nl}One should push oneself to extreme limits and endure the harsh training.{nl}
If you are willing to take the challenge, then we will start immediately.{nl}Talk to me once you are ready for it.
If I were you I'd hurry up.{nl}If you don't defeat enough enemies within the time limit, we'll start from the beginning again.
Very good.{nl}Now is the time for you to learn something from me.
I know that you are ready to be a good Pardoner...{nl}But I'm kind of in big trouble.{nl}
Well, those impious monsters ripped apart the book of offerings.{nl}Because of that, I can't proceed with my other tasks.{nl}
I will tell you the location if you can get me that first book.{nl}I think of you as a trustworthy person since we are close...
The first book is at Elgos Monastery Hospital.{nl}
In order to prevent someone from taking them, I've hidden them in the books...{nl}And I've prepared several fake books, so I want you to find them.
This is the right place.
Welcome.{nl}I am looking for someone who is willing to help me with my research.{nl}
Four years have passed after Medzio Diena...{nl}The aftermath of this disaster hasn't gone down at all, instead it's grown larger.{nl}
Especially the plants that have grown so big turned into monsters and dealt a lot of damage.{nl}I am continuously doing research to resolve this issue.{nl}
If you can help me with my research, I will teach you the next level of the Druid.{nl}I believe this will be an adequate assignment for you.
Please get me samples from the plants who have turned into monsters.{nl}You can obtain more samples the stronger the monster is.
I know that my request was not easy to complete, but you've done it!{nl}These samples that you've brought are excellent and helpful in my research.{nl}As promised, I will help you since you helped me.
I know what business you have with me...{nl}That aside, we have something more important going on right now.{nl}
Suddenly, the evil energy has become stronger in the place I used to look {nl}at using divine power. Using Clairvoyance doesn't even work anymore for me.{nl}
I'm asking you if you could get rid of the evil energy that's lurking there?{nl}If you do, I promise you that I will help you reach the next level.
The location is Galeed Plateau.{nl}Please put the Purification of Namott that I gave you to the area {nl}where the evil energy is strong. 
I knew you were the right person to do this.{nl}As promised, I will lead you to the next level of the Oracle.
Good. Let's get started right away.{nl}
You need to fight the monsters until the time limit expires.{nl}As you defeat stronger monsters, I will acknowledge that you've went through hard training..{nl}
If you don't defeat them within the time limit, you start from scratch. {nl}Be cautious.
Dragoon Master
A Dragoon should never move too far away from an enemy when in danger.{nl}The Dragoon needs to have the courage to fight harder, better, faster, and stronger.
We reject the courage of those who fight without skills.{nl}The path of the Dragoon is a difficult path.{nl}So if you've come here without a strong sense of determination, I suggest you leave now.
Alright, let's see if you really are worthy enough to become one of us.{nl}Show me your skills.{nl}
Your objective is to battle monsters and embrace the pain. Do not move away from them.{nl}That's the determination of a courageous Dragoon. {nl}So, attack and defeat the monsters even if you take damage from them. {nl}Good luck.
What's this? We don't want anyone with a careless mind.{nl}Since I like you, I am giving you another chance. {nl}Come on, show me your courage and your skills!
Excellent. You did good.{nl}From this day forward, I will acknowledge you as a member of the Dragoons.
Are you interested in becoming a Templar?{nl}I can already tell that you're very smart for making this choice.{nl}Now, let me give you a walkthrough of what you need to be aware of.
A Templar is a leader to many people. We need people with strong leadership skills.{nl}Especially during these times, a Templar's leadership is the most likely required.{nl}
Don't get me wrong, though. This is often misunderstood as 'authority'.{nl}No, I'm leaning more towards 'cooperation'.{nl}You should cooperate with your followers in order to maintain a group.{nl} 
Do you understand what I am trying to tell you?{nl}With that being said, let's see your skills as a Templar.
A person in authority makes orders, but a Templar should make requests.{nl}Your task is to recruit five people and become their leader in that group.{nl}While being the leader of the group, you have to lead them for quite some time.
The fuel that drives people is the respect.{nl}So, to confirm if you possess this charm, I will put you up to the test.{nl}
Oh, I absolutely do not like to be deceived by tricks or anything like that.{nl}Recruit five people all by yourself and become the leader of the group.
Well done.{nl}You are certainly much more charming than I expected.
It can be tough to make other people follow you.{nl}The more people following you, the tougher it becomes.{nl}It's not easy, but a Templar with great respect and admiration can pull it off.
I will tell you the things that a Templar must have knowledge in.{nl}I hope you will make wise and careful decisions in the future, so do not forget this.
Warlock Master
We will take any measures by any means for the goddesses...{nl}That is the strict rule that we, Warlocks, must abide by.{nl}
There are many people who misunderstand our interpretations.{nl}A Warlock and its evil spirits are not equally contracted.{nl}We have to rule over them and able to control the evil spirits.{nl}
In order to do so, you need to possess strong magic able to rule and control the evil spirits.{nl}Unless... you want to end up consumed by them. {nl}
Since you don't know these evil spirits as well as I do...{nl}I will give you a scroll that will wake them up.{nl}
Use this scroll on monsters at Valius' Eternal Resting Place{nl}to wake up the sleeping evil spirits.{nl}To add another part of this challenge, you need to defeat a monster and the evil spirits.
Get rid of the poison with poison. {nl}Anything else that is evil should be gotten rid of by the evil spirits. {nl}I am waiting for the day when we, the Warlocks, are not needed anymore.
Excellent.{nl}This is much better than I had expected.{nl}
From now on, you will tread the path of the Warlock. {nl}Oh, and please remember this...{nl}If you don't stand on top of them, you will be consumed by them...{nl}{nl}
Featherfoot Master
I don't know how you found out about the curse of the Featherfoot, but...{nl}This curse should not be overused. Rather, it needs some detailed calculations.{nl} 
Of course, I can teach you if you still want to. However...
Since you don't know anything about the curse, I ask you to take these incantation tools.{nl}I told you that it requires detailed calculations before using the curse.{nl}
Find out what there is to lose and what there is to gain...{nl}Use these incantation tools to cast the curse on a monster to find out.{nl}
If you learn something here, you will become a great Featherfoot.
The curse should not be overused, but instead it requires some detailed calculations.{nl}Experience what the magic used by a Featherfoot is like with help of the tools.
Now, do you have a broader understanding of the Featherfoot's curse?{nl}You should not consider it like the curse that is used by Demon Lords like Naktis.{nl}
The arrows of the curse shall only be used on the enemies of the goddesses.{nl}For us, that is our most important guideline. Please keep that in mind.
Cannoneer Master
You enrolled to become a Cannoneer? Good choice, hotshot.{nl}
Listen up! The most important attribute of the Cannoneer is firepower, a lot of it!{nl}If a Cannoneer cannot distinguish between aerial attacks and ground attacks, {nl}he or she isn't a valuable asset to the team!{nl}Enemies that are flying in the air should only be attacked by aerial attacks,{nl}and enemies that are on the ground should only be attacked by ground attacks.{nl}
I figured you should know about this if you want to become a skilled Cannoneer, like me.{nl}What about it, hotshot? You interested?
Good! Alright, hotshot. {nl}I can only assume that you will remember what I will teach you?{nl}
Do you have a paper and pen with you? Remember this.{nl}There are many types of enemies, but the ones that are flying in the air are all aerial-type.{nl}In contrast, the ones that are moving on the ground are considered a walking-type.{nl}
Alright, face against monsters with both these types.{nl}You need to understand how each enemy moves and which attacks are effective.
The flying monsters are aerial-types and {nl}the ones that move on the ground are walking-types.{nl}Face against both types of monsters. Understood?
Good.{nl}Was this a good lesson? Am I a good teacher?{nl}
Alrighty then! Theoretically, you should know all the logic about what I've taught you.{nl}It's time to put the theory into practice!{nl}The skills of a Cannoneer are not easy, so make sure to focus!
Musketeer Master
A Musketeer should know how to handle a rifle.{nl}Not many enemies can stand against simultaneous firing by well trained Musketeers.
That is why marksmanship is really important.{nl}Finishing enemies before they come anywhere nearby is the start of marksmanship.
One of the basic aspects of marksmanship is to procure range.{nl}Give it a shot. Attack an enemy at maximum range.
It's not just extending the range, but to extend it up the {nl}maximum distance where you are able to shoot.{nl}I am going to put you to the test to see how well you perform.
It's not just extending the range, but being able to extend it up the {nl}maximum distance where you are still able to shoot.{nl}If you want to become a Musketeer, you will accept my challenge.
Now that you know the basics of the Musketeer, it's time to put this in practice.{nl}Alright, let's teach you how to use a rifle!
Plague Doctor Master
Hm, how to describe Plague Doctors...{nl}It's a combination of the authority of the goddesses and the knowledge of humans.{nl}
Enhancing the harmful effects even further and to cure allies who are hurt by these effects.{nl}To put it simply, we are an expert in harmful effects.
Of course I am willing to teach you even if you are not in such a hurry.{nl}But before that, I want you to experience the harmful effect yourself.{nl}It'll be quicker that way, don't you agree?{nl}{nl}
Use this mask on a poisoned monster at Coastal Fortress.{nl}And use it on a sleeping monster at Dingofasil District.
Go there and experience the effects of poison and sleep.
It is better to see it with your own eyes than hear about it.{nl}Getting used to it is the best way of learning.
Wasn't it dangerous?{nl}If you don't do it, you won't be able to learn a thing.
That kind of danger is reduced if you become a Plague Doctor.{nl}Now that you've personally experienced it... {nl}I don't have to repeat myself to emphasize the importance of it, right?
Kabbalist Master
Hey there. Are you also interested in numbers?{nl}I am quite surprised that you know about the Kabbalist. Not many people know about it.{nl}{nl}
Everything in this world can be expressed by numbers.{nl}In order to become a Kabbalist, you would need to understand every hidden number {nl}of all the substances that exist throughout this world.{nl}
But you are a newcomer...{nl}I have a great idea! Instead of explaining it to you, {nl}I want you to experience the wonder by yourself.
Take this crystal sphere with you to Nahash Forest. {nl}Once you are there, a number will appear.{nl}The number that you will see means a specific monster.{nl}
The challenge is that you solve the secret of the number,{nl}and defeat the monster that the number will indicate.{nl}The clue is to think which part of the monster is indicated.
If you really don't know, you can always use the crystal sphere again.{nl}It will show another number of a monster for you to be able to find the rules quickly.
At Nahash Forest, defeat the monsters indicated by the sphere.{nl}However, you have to find out which specific monster was indicated.
When you realize it, it's nothing special. But it is a duty of the Kabbalist to study on the process.{nl}If you keep trying, you will realize the meanings of the numbers.
In order to use more accurate and critical swordsmanship, {nl}you will need faster and more accurate attacks.{nl}The skills of a Fencer that you will learn from now on requires you to {nl}use such swordsmanship.{nl}
Your determination to learn is good, but...{nl}You must be first competent enough.
Good.{nl}When you go right from here, there is a pole to practice your swordsmanship.{nl}
When the light reflects off from the pole, attack the pole accurately.{nl}You should not attack it too late nor when the light doesn't shine.{nl}
I can only let go three time.{nl}If you make mistakes more than three times, then you should do it again from the beginning.
You should also possess some sense of rhythm.{nl}Every move in swordsmanship emphasizes the importance of smoothness.{nl}
Your level of swordsmanship has increased a lot.{nl}I am glad to see you progressing.{nl}
Since you are that competent, you will have no problem in learning new skills.{nl}I will teach you each movement slowly.
Shinobi Master
So you've finally decided become a Shinobi?{nl}Well, although I'd promised to teach you...{nl}
Even if I teach you, there is the issue of whether or not you can do it.{nl}What do you think? Are you prepared?
Defeat an enemy and move out safely.{nl}That is one of the basics of the Shinobi.{nl}
After defeating the monsters at Ruklys Hall, secure your safety immediately.{nl}You shouldn't take any damage from other monsters. {nl}Hide and avoid the attacks from other monsters.
If you get used to this, you will be able to walk out safely {nl}after defeating the target in any dangerous location.{nl}If one puts himself into a danger every time when defeating monsters,{nl} even ten lives won't be enough.
Bravo.{nl}I admit that I didn't expect you to be this talented.{nl}
I always welcome a talented lad like you.{nl}Congratulations on becoming an offical Shinobi.
I still remember Medzio Diena. The horrors...{nl}First, my allies escaped. Now I'm all alone...
It is not just a form to make while using Ninjutsu.{nl}It must be required in order to activate the Ninjutsu.
We should first reduce the fever.{nl}A long time ago, Horace told me that the spotted mushrooms {nl}of the Blue Lapasapes reduces fevers, so let's test it out.
Umm... Isn't it the mask of a Siaulav?{nl}
That's right. Many of our allies were attacked by Blue Siaulavs.{nl}I feel like collecting their masks and burn them in front of their graves.{nl}
So can't you give me those masks?
Thanks.{nl}I hope the resentment of our allies are reduced by this.
I want to calm the spirits of our allies by burning their masks.

Oh, hello? It's been a long time since I've seen an outsider.{nl}My name is Gatre, and I help Sarma with research here.{nl}
Sarma is trying to restore Alemeth Forest to its original state.{nl}The fruits here have become inedible after they grew to enormous sizes you see.{nl}
At least we're managing to get by after Sarma came here to help out.{nl}He promised that I won't have to starve as long as I help him with his research...{nl}I owe him so much.{nl}
The only problem is that the research is being delayed by {nl}monster attacks that are becoming more frequent these days.{nl}I just had a bunch of research materials stolen by monsters as well.{nl}
I was told that they are very important to his research... This is worrying.
Could you really do that?{nl}Then... Could you retrieve the research material from the monsters at Angis Trail?{nl}
The monsters around here are too fierce for me to handle.{nl}Just turn around and run if you happen to think they're too dangerous.
Wow, you've actually retrieved all the materials!{nl}I knew you were kind, but I guess I underestimated your skills.
Um... I know this may sound rude, but could you help me a bit more?{nl}It's a really simple task, but I can see myself getting robbed by monsters again...{nl}
You just have to tidy up the research materials you've retrieved {nl}in the Tidying Chest at the Temporary Research Facility.{nl}I'm sure I can be at ease with someone of your skill doing it... Would it be too much to ask?
Thank you so much!{nl}I'll give you the instruction manual so don't forget {nl}to check the last part before you start tidying up.{nl}
There is a strict order to tidying it...{nl}So, don't forget to read it thoroughly!
Thank you so much.{nl}I'm glad I asked you for help.
It seems as if I am in a daze because of the monster attacks.{nl}I think I discarded invaluable research materials while I was tidying them up.{nl}
The discarded documents should be gathered at Menka Knoll... Could you look for them?{nl}I can't manage to get there because of the increase in monsters.{nl}
I'm sure that you'll be able to find them if you take a close look at the {nl}discarded documents there.{nl}
The documents you need to find is the Research Material List for Alemeth Forest.{nl}
You can leave the rest of the documents behind.{nl}Please check carefully not to get them mixed up with anything else.{nl}
Did you check them carefully?{nl}
It seems like you've brought the correct documents.{nl}Go see Sarma after you give me the documents.{nl}
I think he's kept an eye on your skills.{nl}I think he wants to ask you something after seeing you help me out.
Sarma
Ah, greetings.{nl}I assume you've heard of me from Gatre.{nl}
I've been keeping a close eye on you since you helped Gatre.{nl}At first I was merely curious of an outsider here, but you seem to be quite talented.
As you may be well aware of, it is hard to do any research because of the monsters.{nl}I think I'll be able to finish my research if you help me out a bit.{nl}
It's for the wellbeing of the people here so I beg that you help out.{nl}Of course I shall pay handsomely when the research is finished.
I thank you.{nl}My first request is for you to gather the blood of Green Eldigos.{nl}
I need to extract the blood from a live Green Eldigo for my research, but that's no easy task.{nl}I'll give you some Tranquilizer Powder to knock {nl}the Green Eldigos out and bring some blood back.
So, how did it go?{nl}
Very good. Excellent.{nl}With the skills you've shown me, I think I can be confident in assigning you more tasks.{nl}
I'll go to the Forest of Prayer Entrance and prepare for the final experiment.{nl}You can go and gather the ingredients needed for the last experiment.{nl}
Gatre has the list for the ingredients I need for the final experiment so you can get it from him.{nl}I have faith in you.
Sarma said that he needed all of the ingredients on the list?{nl}
Oh no, it seems as if he's already beginning the final experiment!{nl}We have to find more evidence before it's too late.{nl}
It would be strange to not collect the ingredients without proper evidence.{nl}Collect the listed ingredients since you can't risk him suspecting anything.{nl}
Why don't we gather some evidence together since Sarma seems to be absent.{nl}I know just what to look for.
There are research notes from a person that used to help Sarma's experiments.{nl}His name was Boldas... and is in a coma because of an unfortunate accident.{nl}
Sarma had those notes until he lost them in a monster attack.{nl}Come to think of it, I think Sarma was especially nervous about losing those notes.{nl}
There may be important information in those notes.{nl}He lost the notes towards the Juice Collection Site, so try searching that area first.{nl}
Don't forget the listed ingredients either.{nl}I'll do what Sarma asked in order to avoid suspicion.
Do you have all of the ingredients?{nl}
Hmm. There seems to be something missing...
Ah! It seems that it's missing from the list.{nl}I thought I had written everything down, but mistakes where made...{nl}
I'm sorry, but could you go get some fermented fruit tree sap from Gatre?{nl}I can't proceed with the experiment without it.
Sarma told you that he needed fermented fruit tree sap right?{nl}
He really has come close to finishing the experiments.{nl}You see, I had removed the sap from the list on purpose.{nl}
By the way, how does Sarma's research seem to you?{nl}Did you find anything suspicious in the research notes?
I think that's a good idea.{nl}We might be able to find some clues as to what Sarma is really up to.
That was written in the notes?{nl}I'll need to take a look at the notes myself.{nl}
Oh my...{nl}If these notes are true, then Sarma definitely has other plans for his research.
But the matter still stands that we don't have any actual proof.{nl}I'll look for some solid evidence if you can manage to stall the experiments for a bit.{nl}
Take something that is similar to the sap in order to ruin Sarma's experiment.{nl}Meanwhile, I'll check all of his research documents.{nl}
I'll give you this tree sap.{nl}All you have to do is to go to the Research Material Warehouse {nl}and find something that looks similar to this.{nl}
He has to mix all the ingredients before commencing the last stage anyways.{nl}So he won't be able to tell them apart as long as they look similar.
Is this water from... near Pelke Shrine Ruins?
I've heard that something bad happened there...{nl}Well, I suppose it will be alright.
Take this to Sarma since they look almost identical at a glance.{nl}I'll take a peek at his research documents and try to find out his true purpose.
Be careful just in case.{nl}I'll get to you as soon as I find something.
What took you so long in bringing me one more ingredient?{nl}
Well, it seems as if you've brought the proper ingredient.{nl}This is the last stage of the experiment.
Now all that is left is to put this on the Transmutation Magic Circle and add magic.{nl}I've set it so that anyone can power it with magic, so you shouldn't have trouble. {nl}Now go and power the magic circle.
T-That's... because I have other things to do.{nl}I have to leave records of the experiment and observe the situation you see.{nl}
Now stop stalling and go power up the Transmutation Magic Circle.{nl}All you have to do is put the ingredients on the circle {nl}and emancipate the magic from the tombstone.{nl}
But remember that the magic in the tombstone can only be emancipated from the front.
Has the liquid properly been created?{nl}
Ahah.{nl}It seems that I finally have results for this research.
Now all I have to do is check to see if the liquid has the intended effect.{nl}
Thanks to you, I've been able to get the research, which had been progressing slowly, this far.{nl}With this, we'll be able to restore the enlarged fruit trees back to normal.{nl}
How about you spray the liquid onto the trees yourself since you've helped me so far?{nl}If it has been properly made, it will make the trees go back to their original states.
Here, I'll give you some of the liquid.{nl}We'll be able to see if it has any effect immediately.{nl}
Try spraying it on the Pile of Leaves just ahead of you.{nl}You'll be able to see something quite interesting.
I'm sorry.{nl}I wasn't able to catch Sarma.{nl}
Thankfully, the liquid wasn't created as Sarma planned.{nl}Even though he seems to think that it is perfect.{nl}
Sarma's original plan was to create monsters that he could command.{nl}Thankfully, they don't seem to listen to him since we switched the ingredients a bit.{nl}
I'll go looking for Sarma.{nl}Even though the liquid is a failure, it's still quite dangerous.
I hope that the hidden items will be found and used by whomever sees this inside the pot.{nl}There is another pot at the Old Camp that shows the location of the hidden items.
Monster attacks have been too frequent lately.{nl}That's why Sarma's research is also being delayed.
Don't forget to read the last part of the instruction manual.
It will be hard to find the documents at Menka Knoll if you don't read them carefully.{nl}There's a lot of documents that are actually being disposed there as well.
I've put my whole life's achievements on restoring Alemeth Forest to its original state.{nl}This research must succeed.
Anyone would be upset about losing their notes.{nl}But Sarma... seemed to be much more than upset at the loss.
The contents of those notes might prove to be important evidence.
If you do get caught, just say that it was a simple mistake.{nl}The important thing is to buy us some more time.
First, help Sarma with his experiments.{nl}I'll try to find some evidence in the meantime.
The magic from the tombstone must be emancipated from the front.{nl}The front is the side with the letters on it, so be careful.
It is finally time for my research to come to fruition...
I had merely panicked a bit because of the sudden attack.{nl}I am not frightened of such monsters!
I'm conducting research in order to restore the forest to its original state.{nl}Those fruits are inedible you see...
It was hard getting a chance to talk to you because of Sarma.{nl}Now, I can tell you everything since he's gone.
I can't believe he was researching how to control monsters...{nl}I'm having a hard time believing how a person could even {nl}think of doing so even after witnessing it with my two eyes.
They've all left because the fruits were inedible even though they were so large.{nl}But how could you turn your back on your hometown?
What do you think the real purpose for Sarma's research is?{nl}I just hope that I'm worrying over nothing...
The villagers all believed in Sarma and his research...{nl}How could he do such a thing?
You're an outsider that I haven't seen before.{nl}I don't know what you're doing here, but please don't interrupt my research.
Everything is going as planned except for those monsters.{nl}They're hindering my research so much that it's become more than a mere nuisance.
I wish to show you the research once it's complete.{nl}Of course I will show it to Gatre who's been helping me all along as well.
At last, the day that my research reaches fruition has come...{nl}It is a relief that I was able to receive help from someone as able as you.
Necromancer Lemija
Adomas is late...{nl}Where could he be?
Where have Adomas and Faustas gone to when we have so much to do...{nl}Have you seen any Necromancers around here by any chance?
It would have been hard even if we all worked together...{nl}But now, doing so is impossible.
That Lord Lieutenant... He deserves to be attacked by monsters just like them.{nl}I'm only holding back because the mayor is too.
The goddesses are so merciless...{nl}I had only started to collect coral after giving up fishing for a living...
I think everyone is shocked by the Lord Lieutenant.{nl}Well... At least I'm glad that things turned out alright in the end.
Just look at them.{nl}They were attacked by monsters trying to gather tributes...{nl}It's just so wrong.
I'll be fine as long as I get some proper rest thanks to the first aid.{nl}You've been a great help.
It's just pathetic.{nl}We don't even have basic amenities, but we're worrying about making tributes...
That Lord Lieutenant will bring the wrath of the goddesses upon himself soon enough.{nl}He not only tried to get more tributes for himself, but also disgraced the lord.
There is nothing more important to a merchant than credibility.{nl}I need to acquire the necessary coral in time... but it seems like I'm in trouble.
I've heard. You've dealt with the terrifying monster that the Lord Lieutenant summoned.{nl}I wish that someone like you was in our merchant alliance.
Don't stray too far from here if you can help it.{nl}The monster density increased so much that it's too dangerous.
I never would've thought that my colleagues were also in league with the Lord Lieutenant...{nl}My head's still numb when I think of all those years we've served together.
Please stay here where it's safe, if possible.{nl}There's no way for us to help if you stray too far away from here.
We're going to transport that Lord Lieutenant to the lord soon.{nl}I doubt that he'll get off easy...
Please refrain from going too far away because there has been an increase of monsters.{nl}We won't be able to guarantee your safety due to our orders.
An outsider helped out with something that we should have done ourselves...{nl}This is shameful.
Do you think I won't do anything after all of this humility? Wait and see. {nl}I'll show the merchant alliance and the refugees here who gets the last laugh some day!
This guy, he still seem to be delusional.{nl}Does he really not know what situation he is in?
It's all gone upside down because of that Lord Lieutenant and a few soldiers.{nl}I'm certain that they'll make inquiries into us as well.
Merchant Alliance Worker
It was nice having a bit of a rest, but we weren't quite at ease either.{nl}I guess we can finally go to the customers.
I haven't been working here long, but that is a sight to behold.{nl}An ocean without any water... I've never seen anything like it.
I've heard that coral is really popular.{nl}I think it's said to be used in very expensive medicines... {nl}How much do you think it is worth?
I guess anything can happen when the world is in such disarray.{nl}He's lucky the people here are gentle, he'd be thoroughly beaten if it was back where I'm from.
What's going on?{nl}There are people willing to work and soldiers to protect them, {nl}yet we can't get the coral because of monsters?
This used to be the bottom of the sea, but they say {nl}that all the water was drained after Medzio Diena.{nl}It's quite a sight don't you think?
It's chilling to think that the Lord Lieutenant was the reason we weren't able to gather coral.{nl}I'm glad it's over now. All's well that ends well as they say.{nl}
People like us have never even held a sword before, so all we can do is to envy your skills.{nl}Isn't it impressive that our leader found out that it {nl}was the Lord Lieutenant who was behind all of this?
It's a shame about what happened to Faustas... But his crimes cannot be forgiven.{nl}He murdered... he murdered Adomas.
I'm planning on carrying out the rest of the mission.{nl}I'll have to tell the master about what happened... But I don't feel too comfortable.
Search for the Monk
It seems as if returning to the annex is out of the question.{nl}Look for the monk that's trapped in the principal building.
You have found a labeled reagent bottle in a pile of leaves.{nl}
Base reagent. Nahash Sample.
{nl}Look for the reagent's owner.
A tent that appears to have been attacked by monsters... Check to see what happened?
Missing Lucienne
Lucienne is missing!{nl}It seems as if she has gone to the Ownerless Reclaimed Land to use the reagent.
Searching past the Wall
It seems as if only Dominikas can pass through the black wall.{nl}Dominikas seems to be hiding something beyond the wall and lying about it.{nl}Search past the wall.
Elgos Monk
I'm so... hungry...
Starved
It seems as if there is nothing more to eat.
Lucienne Winterspoon
Thank you so much for saving me!{nl}Whew, I was in a tight spot with my tent being attacked and all.
Oh, my name is Lucienne Winterspoon by the way.{nl}I am a member of the Winterspoon family which is renown for its alchemical prowess.{nl}
Vaidotas. You know him right?{nl}Alchemist Master Vaidotas is my older cousin.
Have you heard that Vaidotas was kidnapped by the Vubbes?{nl}I mean, he's the Alchemist Master... {nl}I think I was more ashamed of the kidnapping than he was.{nl}
That's why I've decided that I should take his place.{nl}Don't you think it's obvious that I'm more suitable for the position?{nl}
The family elders are holding me back though.{nl}Would you believe that they're saying that they can't {nl}acknowledge my skill without distinct research results!{nl}
That's why I came here.{nl}I'm trying to do some research on why the regions near Nahash Forest{nl}received less damage than other places on Medzio Diena.{nl}
But I've been unable to make much headway because there are so many monsters.{nl}It turns out that the only reason it was damaged less is because the bedrock is more solid.{nl}
Then I discovered something amazing in Nahash Forest!{nl}There was an enormous plant rooted to the Ownerless Reclaimed Land, you see.{nl}
I thought it was perfect for my experiments because it wouldn't react to most substances.{nl}Think about it! Making a reagent that can get rid of such a large plant.{nl}
I'll be able to restore damaged regions like Orsha or the Thorn Forest back to normal...{nl}It might even open a path to being able to prevent a second Medzio Diena from happening.{nl}
Don't you think that the family elders will also acknowledge me as well?
The problem is that the over abundant monster population is hindering my research.{nl}There should be less monsters if I could get to Pamesti Village...{nl}
Of course. You seemed to be quite skilled back there...{nl}I'm sorry, but could you get me to Pamesti Village?{nl}
I promise I won't forget you if you help me out this time after I become the Alchemist Master!
Thanks! You've brought me to the village safely.{nl}Now I have to get ready for the experiments again.
...Oh! Whoops!{nl}I must have dropped my base reagent somewhere {nl}while I was running away from the testing tent...{nl}
I can't do any more experiments without it, what a stupid mistake.{nl}What should I do...
Yes! That's it!{nl}How on earth did you get a hold of it?{nl}
Oh... I must have dropped it in the tent I was conducting experiments in.{nl}It's a relief to have it back. Thank you so much. You're absolutely the best!
Now I have to collect the remaining ingredients.{nl}I can get most of the herbs on my own, but I don't think I can take on the Blue Spion by myself...{nl}
So do you think that you could get some Spion Tree Leaves for me?{nl}I'll try to gather the other herbs in the meantime.
Thanks a lot.{nl}Let's meet up back here once we've finish gathering the ingredients.
You're back earlier than I expected.{nl}I hope you didn't have too hard a time dealing with the Blue Spion.
Now all I have to do is to mix the reagent with these ingredients.{nl}The only problem is that the monsters seem to be attracted to the smell of the reagent.{nl}
Could you deal with any monsters that happen to come near me while I mix the reagent?{nl}So that I can focus entirely on mixing the reagent.
It's finally finished! Thank you so much. {nl}I couldn't have dreamed of finishing the reagent without your help!
Now all that's left is to test the reagent.{nl}Luckily, I've seen an appropriate vine near the Herb Broker Tent.{nl}
Tree vines don't usually grow in Nahash Forest, but that place seems to be the exception.{nl}Strange isn't it? It almost seems like someone is raising them there.{nl}
It just doesn't seem right just like that enormous plant.{nl}
Well whatever the case, that tree vine seems to be perfect to test the reagent on.{nl}How about doing the last experiment together since we've crafted the reagent together? 
Did you see that? The vine grew and then crumbled!{nl}It's a success! Our reagent actually worked!
I can't believe that I completed a reagent without the help of Vaidotas...{nl}I'm so happy. The next Alchemist Master will be me when I show the family this reagent!{nl}
So. Let's go the the Ownerless Reclaimed Land. {nl}I'm sure that we'll be able to get rid of the enormous {nl}plant there and stop the plants from expanding further.
Alchemist Master
Lucienne Winterspoon...{nl}May I ask how you came to learn of the name of that troublemaker?{nl}
What? You've brought me a reagent that she made in Nahash Forest?{nl}Please give that to me. What has she concocted up this time...{nl}
...Oh dear. {nl}Did you perhaps test this reagent? {nl}
This reagent accelerates plant growth.{nl}The plant will crumble if it doesn't have the strength to withstand it but if it does...{nl}
We don't have time for this.{nl}Knowing Lucienne, she might have already gone to use the reagent somewhere.{nl}
I'll give you this counteragent. Please hurry and give this to Lucienne.
What took you so long?{nl}You said you'd ask Vaidotas didn't you?
Having a healthy amount of scholarly ambition is something to be commemorated.{nl}But passion past her skills is not good for Lucienne.
...Okay. I guess I was wrong this time.{nl}Something bad could have happened without Vaidotas' help.{nl}
That doesn't mean that I've lost to Vaidotas though!{nl}Don't you know that failure is the mother of success?{nl}
I've failed miserably this time so I'm going to get a great breakthrough soon!{nl}
There's no time for this.{nl}I think I can do the rest of the experiments by myself.{nl}
Farewell then. I thank you for all the help you've given me. {nl}I never forget my debts, so I will repay it one day by helping you.
No... Wait...{nl}Why is Vaidotas being brought up in this?!{nl}
It's me who succeeded in the experiment, so why should Vaidotas get to see this?{nl}I've mixed this reagent, so why should Vaidotas...{nl}
Is it because the vine we tested it on grew a bit?{nl}What does that have to do with anything. It's gone thanks to my reagent!{nl}
...If it bothers you that much, you go by yourself.{nl}I don't want to go. Do as you please.
Even though it's a bit infuriating, but Vaidotas took {nl}a look at my reagent's ingredients and mix ratio.{nl}It seems that I should have used Spion Teeth instead of the leaves.{nl}
I can get the rest of the materials, but Spions are still to much for me...{nl}Could you get me some Spion Teeth?
Well... It would be nice if this mix ratio succeeds..{nl}It will mean that Vaidotas is wrong if it fails so...{nl}
It would seem rude to not proceed with the experiment when he's being so considerate...
Thanks. {nl}I'm going to humiliate Vaidotas after succeeding and improving the reagent!
Are you planning on going elsewhere?{nl}Hm... Well then...{nl}
I took a look at the soil from a farm on the Ownerless Reclaimed Land, and it was superb.{nl}I think that if I plant some experimental herbs there, they'll do well.{nl}
I'll give you the herb seeds. {nl}Could you plant them if you happen to pass by the Ownerless Reclaimed Land?{nl}Come on, you can help me out just a bit more can't you?
I wouldn't have been able to get this far with the research without you.{nl}Even though I don't want to admit it, V-Vaidotas helped as well...
Villager Nella
Thank you for saving us at the monastery.{nl}I can't imagine what that swindler would've done to us if it wasn't for you...{nl}
Still, the swindler's incantation seems to be having a bit of an effect.{nl}We haven't been attacked by monsters for a while.{nl}
Well, that doesn't mean that we can live in harmony with the monsters.{nl}We also don't know when we'll be attacked by the monsters again because the incantation's effect will wear off later.{nl}
Could you help deal with the monsters near the town?{nl}It'll be much safer if you could help out a little.
The village has been totally destroyed while we were trapped at the monastery.{nl}Well this... I suppose it was our own fault for getting tricked like that.
Thank you.{nl}Oh, I don't think you'll have to worry about the rest of the monsters.{nl}
Lucienne Winterspoon said that she'll craft us monster repellant while she stays here.{nl}I hope you'll stay safe on your travels.
Welcome. Brother.{nl}Have you come to be redeemed by us of the Tree of Truth?{nl}
If so, welcome.{nl}I was just educating the believers of our creed.{nl}How about you join us for a moment.
Good. {nl}Now, I shall begin the sermon.{nl}
Oh yes... It might be a bit dizzy at first.{nl}That is all part of the process in receiving the Divine Tree's blessing.
How was your first sermon about the creed? {nl}Was it alright?{nl}
Good, good.{nl}I welcome you once more.{nl}
Although the Divine Tree is benevolent, redemption does not come for free.{nl}You must work for the chance to be redeemed.{nl}
Helping other believers might be a good place to start since you are new.{nl}I hope to see you soon.
Greetings. Brother.{nl}Have you received the Demon Soul Orb from Dominikas?{nl}
The demons will not attack you on sight if you hold an orb filled with their souls.{nl}It seems as if you have yet to receive the orb from Dominikas.{nl}
I have an extra Soul Orb.{nl}But... you'll have to fill it with demon souls yourself.{nl}
Still, you won't have to worry about demons attacking you once it's filled with demon souls.{nl}The benevolent Divine Tree shall protect you.
I've learned that although demons are our enemies, they are also to be redeemed just like us.{nl}We will all become one in the blessings of the Divine Tree.
I see you've filled the orb.{nl}How was it? I assume the demons didn't attack you on the way back?{nl}
What? You were attacked?{nl}That's strange. It is most likely due to your lack of faith.{nl}
Ah, look at the time...{nl}Pardon me, I must prepare to attend an important ritual.
Welcome. You're the newcomer, right?{nl}I am selecting scriptures here.{nl}
To us, the goddesses are immoral as only the Divine Tree can offer true redemption.{nl}We no longer need the old scriptures that worship the goddesses.{nl}
What do we do with the useless scriptures?{nl}We usually gather them and burn them.
Thank you for saving me!{nl}Of course, this is all because of the blessing of the Divine Tree.{nl}
Why do you think the demons attacked us?{nl}That is strange... This has never happened before.{nl}
Farewell then... I need to attend a ritual.{nl}Make sure you're not late either, brother. I will see you later.
Villager James
Oh, so you are the newcomer.{nl}It's a pleasure to meet you.{nl}
I am purifying the corrupted power of the goddesses with the red blood of the demons. {nl}However, it seems that I've run out.{nl}
Normally Dominikas gets it for me but he seems to be busy at the moment.{nl}Not to mention the fact that we are currently under {nl}their protection so we can't attack them either.{nl}
That's why I want you to go get some red demon blood.{nl}As a recruit you can do this much, no?
Thank you.{nl}Demon blood has a special power that can purify the corrupted power of the goddesses.{nl}
Look around you, all of this was the result of my purification.{nl}How about it, beautiful isn't it?{nl}
Well it's about time I leave.{nl}You're free to wander the monastery but try not to go near {nl}the black wall in the Annex Laboratory up there.{nl}{nl}
That wall is full of holy energy so that only those chosen {nl}by the Divine Tree such as Dominikas can go there.{nl}Well then, see you later.
...How did you get in here?{nl}This is a sacred place that only those who are chosen by the Divine Tree may enter.{nl}
Oh my, it appears that the Divine Tree has already chosen you.{nl}I knew you were something special the moment I laid my eyes upon you.
To think that you were chosen the moment you joined, this is quite an amazing turn of events.{nl}There is a very important ritual coming up... a ritual to bestow the Divine Tree's blessings.
All the other followers are waiting at the passage that leads to the annex.{nl}Although I must go ahead in order to prepare for the ritual, please take your time.
Hurry and deliver this.{nl}I can no longer stand to see the corrupted power of the goddesses.
I feel an evil presence coming from the vines that Dominikas left behind.{nl}To think that our monastery might have been covered in such a thing, how frightening.
Is there any way to get rid of those vines?
Hmm...You say that you need a particular reagent to get rid of the vines?
You've arrived at just the right time.{nl}The reagent that Vaidotas was working on is done.
Here!{nl}I'll call it "Lucienne's Special Reagent"!{nl}
...What's wrong?{nl}It's real this time! I made sure it's safe this time!{nl}
Even if you can't trust me you should trust Vaidotas!
Welcome back.{nl}Please hurry, I don't want to look at the terrible vines any longer.
That's Winterspoon for you!{nl}It's almost like that vine was never there, thank you so much, Revelator!
Sorry for making you help us so much...{nl}We owe you our sincere thanks.
I am talking about the scripture from the Order of the Tree of Truth left by Dominikas.{nl}It turns out that the impious thing still remains in the monastery.{nl}
If you see the fake scripture, could you bring it to me?{nl}We're too short-handed to spare anyone at the moment...{nl}
Those at the Order of the Tree of Truth... to think they would corrupt the power of the goddesses...{nl}This is just blasphemy to the goddesses!
So you've found the fake scripture. Thank you.{nl}Give it to me and I will take care of it.
S-Stop...!{nl}I will do whatever you ask me, so please stop!
Should I just join the Order of the Tree of Truth?{nl}If I did, would I be able to escape this hunger?
Lies...{nl}If not... How... The black wall...
It seems that he's been malnourished for a long time.{nl}I can't talk to him now.
Thank you so much...{nl}I am so sorry for misunderstanding you. I thought something was going wrong...{nl}
After I regained my consciousness, I felt this mysterious energy from you.{nl}What happened?{nl}
Ah... So you're the Revelator.{nl}I guess this is why the black wall couldn't block you.
Thank you. I was able to survive because of you.{nl}Dominikas... He's more cruel than the demons.
It hasn't been a long time since Dominikas visited the Elgos Monastery.{nl}I thought he was just an accompanying monk.{nl}
Not so long after he came here, the tree vines and the {nl}demons suddenly swept the monastery annex.{nl}The villagers fled there... But, he stopped them appropriately.{nl}
When I think about it, it was all a facade.{nl}The raid of the tree vines and the sudden attacks of the demons...{nl}
As the villagers started to follow him, he quickly showed his true nature.{nl}He asked us to create a sinister idol and believe in the Divine Tree.{nl}
Of course, we resisted... But he locked us into that black wall.{nl}He gave us just enough water to stay alive and tried to convert us to his religion.
I felt so painful since I didn't know what to do.{nl}Ah... The abbot!{nl}
The abbot must be locked inside the monastery.{nl}I was hoping that the goddesses would protect us... {nl}But we will be in trouble if we don't quickly give you the food.
Elgos Abbot
This energy... Yes, it's you. The Revelator.{nl}It seems the goddesses finally answered my prayer.{nl}
Ah, nothing. If the other monks are alright, the food will be okay...{nl}I don't think I'll be able to swallow the food.
He's too old... Is he going to be alright...?
As expected, Revelator, you're not blocked by the black wall.
The sinister idol that was created by Dominikas in front of Pagarba Chapel...{nl}The black wall started to cover the monastery because of that idol.{nl}
If we destroy that sinister idol...{nl}There might be a good chance that the whole wall may disappear.
I just don't know how I can destroy it...{nl}There is nothing I can think of at the moment.{nl}
No, wait...{nl}I can sense the demons' souls from you.{nl}
That sphere you have...{nl}Is a demon's soul locked inside it?{nl}
That's it.{nl}Maybe we can use this to destroy the sinister idol.{nl}
The idea is to purify the demons' souls and use their power.{nl}Unfortunately, we lack the right amount of souls to destroy the idol.{nl}
Can you fill it with a little bit more of the demons' souls?{nl}As you already may know, defeating demons will automatically absorb their souls.
Without a doubt the demons are strong... that's why I guess that their souls are strong as well.{nl}My sacred energy is not strong enough to purify this much power.
We should somehow borrow the power of holy water...{nl}Like I told you before though, I have nothing at the moment.
I am so sorry, but can you get me Holy Water from the Priest Master in Klaipeda?{nl}If we have enough holy water, we'll be able to purify the demons' fallen souls.
Please use the statue of Goddess Vakarine near Viyme Fountain.{nl}You can quickly come back from Klaipeda.
With this, you'll be able to purify the souls contained within the Soul Sphere.{nl}Now, give me a moment.
Since the power of a demon's soul is strong, the residual power after purification possesses strength as well.{nl}This power has the capability to destroy the sinister idol.{nl}
Put the purified Soul Sphere's power into the sinister idol.{nl}I hope the idol can't endure this...
Finally!{nl}Now, we can be freed from the black wall.{nl}
It's been such a long time...{nl}I think my prayer to the goddesses was not in vain...
Now, we'll need to focus on the main culprit of the Order of the Tree of Truth, Dominikas...{nl}Everything will be over once we drive him out.{nl}
Please lend me your power a little longer.{nl}Even if we have the methods to catch him, we can't use our powers {nl}since the villagers have been possessed from being tortured so long...{nl}
He seems to have some sort of power that allows him to control plants.{nl}I sincerely warn you that he is not to be underestimated.
Dominikas... He ran away...{nl}
We shouldn't worry too much.{nl}It's a big blow that we drove out the Order of the Tree of Truth from the Elgos Monastery.{nl}
And the monsters instead of plants' explosion, I guess it stopped since the spell was unstable.{nl}We were able to protect the villagers because of you.{nl} 
When we get better, we will clean up the monastery.{nl}Of course, we should drive out the demons as well.{nl}
Even if the world collapses, we believe in people like you who give hope...{nl}You give us the power to endure.{nl}
I don't want to imagine what would've happened without you...{nl}On behalf of the whole monastery, we greatly appreciate your help.
You've done it!{nl}The black wall disappeared...{nl}
Thank you for saving the monastery.{nl}Ah, is the abbot alright?{nl}
...So that is it. {nl}Your faith is as strong as I imagined.
Good! Anything. {nl}Just tell me what I can do for you.{nl}
What? {nl}So the villagers think we ran away after abandoning the monastery?{nl}
Those people at the Order of the Tree of Truth... {nl}They locked others inside and alienated them...{nl}
Can you go to the villagers with me?{nl}If you are with me, all misunderstandings will be solved.
Hmm... It seems that the villagers found out the true identity of Dominikas.{nl}It is fortunate that the task was solved easier than expected...{nl}
I will send the villagers back to the village.{nl}I really appreciate that you've reclaimed the Elgos Monastery from the Order of the Tree of Truth.
The demons here are very strong. {nl}Be careful.
Don't underestimate the power of the sinister idol.{nl}Be careful.
Now, the Revelator will continue the journey by following the will of the goddesses.{nl}But before you leave, can you do me one more favor for this old man?{nl}
Although we got rid of the Order of the Tree of Truth...{nl}The evil demons still prevail.{nl}
If you lend me your power, we'll be able to drive out the demons much faster.{nl}Can you defeat the demons here?{nl}
There is something that is bothering me.{nl}I think driving out the Order of the Tree of Truth was wonderful, but...
Dominikas ran away.{nl}I think he may come back by leading the Order of the Tree of Truth...{nl}
I want to prepare something for this...{nl}Can you help me?
If Dominikas comes back again...{nl}Then, I will not stand idly by.
Thank you. {nl}I can relax now because of you.
Good. You should do it.{nl}I was actually going to Veyrhas Hall to burn the scripture...{nl}
It's better to see it once than to hear it a hundred times.{nl}Let's go together. Brother.
I didn't know that one of people of the Winterspoon family came to Nahash Forest.{nl}Even so, since you know this person, he or she must be reliable.{nl}I'm counting on you.
I can't exactly remember what I did back then.{nl}It's as if I was possessed by something...{nl}
Yes! {nl}I wouldn't have done such a disrespectful act with a conscious mind.
I will apologize to the other monks later.{nl}I can't believe what I did.{nl}
Look around you.{nl}Don't you think it's beautiful?{nl}
The red blood of demons contain special powers.{nl}That's why only their blood can wash away the corrupted power of the goddess.
The Order of the Tree of Truth turned the monastery into a complete mess...
We have to clean up the blood of the demons and tidy up the scripture...{nl}We have many things to do.
It will be effective!{nl}Even so... If it goes wrong, you should tell me... For sure...
Revelator, I am eternally thankful to you.
Dominikas opened my eyes to a new light.{nl}Only the Divine Tree can save us...
I need to save my power since we don't know when {nl}the Order of the Tree of Truth will attack the monastery again.{nl}I really thank you.
How could we lose the monastery to a heresy like the Order of the Tree of Truth...{nl}I am sorry to the goddess and I am thankful to her.
I won't be deceived by the lies of the goddess anymore.{nl}You also think so, right?
You really are...{nl}You might be the envoy that was sent by the goddess...{nl}
What's strange is that Dominikas often visited Pagarba Chapel.{nl}It could very well mean that he may have hidden something important there.{nl}
If you hide there, you will definitely manage to ambush Dominikas.{nl}I will pray for you in the name of the goddess.
As we cleaned up the monastery...{nl}I found a bunch of the Soul Spheres that were left by Dominikas.{nl} 
Can you remember when you broke the sinister idol?{nl}How about I put the demon souls into the sphere and purify them.{nl}
I will give you the Soul Sphere if you could defeat the demons with these, please.{nl}You can put the souls into this sphere.
One day, I will become the Alchemist Master!
I'll receive help from Vaidotas until I become the Alchemist Master.{nl}It's not because I lost to Vaidotas, it's just that I'm trying to use him!{nl}
Really!!
I sense something strange in the villagers. As he said, let's help the villagers.
Believe in the Divine Tree and let it save you.{nl}The door of the Order of the Tree of Truth is always open.
Fake goddesses, untruthful doctrines... Are you sure that your belief in them has become quite strong?{nl}But that's the wrong path to salvation.{nl}
Tell me when you are ready.
I regret that I may have done something wrong due to hunger.{nl}If Dominikas came instead of you... we wouldn't have been able to go back...
I am worried about the abbot.{nl}He is old... I hope the goddesses take care of him...
Ahah... No matter how much I think, there is no way.{nl}Now, everything may be ruined...{nl}
I haven't seen you before.{nl}What has brought you this far?{nl}
It doesn't matter.{nl}If you have time, could you listen to this old man for a while?
This was... originally a sea...{nl}We were fishers who caught fishes in this sea.{nl}
But, as you can see...{nl}The land suddenly soared upwards.{nl}
At first, I was thinking whether I should quit fishing, but... it soon turned out alright.{nl}I've earned a lot of money by picking up corals. {nl}
The monsters were, without a doubt, a bit scary, but the lord was there to help us.{nl}The lord sent her army and the Lord Lieutenant in exchange for a offering.{nl}
But not too long ago, the monsters went crazy.{nl}We couldn't pick up the corals and even had to evacuate.{nl}
Of course, we have told the Lord Lieutenant about this.{nl}However, he said protecting the town and defeating the monsters {nl}were two different things, and the latter would cost additional tributes.{nl}
We've ran out of the corals that we've collected. {nl}The merchants are waiting for us... What should we do...{nl} 
I'm just saying it is.{nl}Thank you for listening to the complaints of an old man.
Hmm... Are you the rumored Revelator?{nl}I've heard you possess quite talented skills.{nl}
Have you heard of the coral named Lhu'uvik?{nl}It's a valuable coral used for creating magical tools or for finding magic principles.
I've come all this way to trade it...{nl}But as you can probably see, I've gotten in to trouble.{nl}
There is nothing more important than the schedules and the promises of a merchant.{nl}If we go empty-handed like this, we will suffer from tremendous damage.{nl}
It's not only us, but it also counts for those villagers.{nl}If it continues like this, they will lose their jobs and {nl}be forced to look for other places to live.{nl}
I want to borrow your power to help those poor villagers.{nl}Can you help me so that they can start collecting coral again?
Thank you for accepting.{nl}First, that lieutenant doesn't want to receive anything besides the corals for tributes.
Eventually, we will have to get rid of the monsters so that the villagers can gather corals.{nl}You are the only one I can trust, please get rid of them.{nl}
I hope this clears things up...{nl}In case something happens, while you are taking care of it, {nl}I will send a person to look at the status of the monsters.{nl}
It will be great if we could just drive out the monsters, but...{nl}Something's up.
Oh, you've come back already?{nl}You're just as great as I've heard.
I knew it wouldn't be that easy.{nl}It's so strange that many monsters are rushing in so quickly.
This is not just related to the monsters. There must be a different reason.{nl}I will investigate this seperately. Can you ask people here if they saw anything strange?
You would think the Lord Lieutenant would be the first one to help, but no!{nl}He would rather waste his time threatening us... How strange.{nl}
If it was just a matter of taxing additional tributes,{nl}why doesn't the Lord Lieutenant take some measures.{nl}Anyway, how did the investigation go?{nl}
So as the number of monsters increased, the strange smell started to spread.{nl}Hmm...{nl}
I can't think that the monsters are not related to the smell.{nl}Can you check where that smell is coming from?{nl}
If we are lucky enough, we might be able to find the source of the smell.{nl}If you find it, please bring it to me. I will get rid of it right away.
I am counting on you.{nl}Please check the coast for spots where the smell is coming from.
The smell and the monsters...{nl}
Just as I thought! In the contents of the pouch was a powder that allures monsters.{nl}Somebody must have deliberately used them to draw the monsters in.{nl}
If the smell disappears, there will be no reason for the monsters to go crazy.{nl}Can you dig out the same pouches from the pit?
I will find out more about the pouch in the meantime.{nl}I don't know yet whether it someone left it on accident or on purpose.
Oh my god... This many...{nl}I can see why so many monsters are being drawn in.{nl}
Someone is definitely disturbing the coral harvesting.{nl}I don't know why, but whoever behind it must be evil.
Yes.{nl}I told you that the Lord Lieutenant is little strange.{nl}
It would've been quite efficient if the Lord Lieutenant would personally go out and defeat the monsters.{nl}Even if this delays the tribute delivery a bit.{nl}
Yet, he didn't do it.{nl}
If he knows defeating the monsters is a waste of time...{nl}I think everything is coming together, now.
If what I am thinking is correct, the Lord Lieutenant will try to steal the tributes.{nl}However we don't have the evidence to support that claim.{nl}
Alright... Let's answer our suspicions right now. Do we lure the suspect out?{nl}I want you to be responsible for the most important role.
I've told the Lord Lieutenant in advance.{nl}The smell was spreading badly in the pit, making it unable to bear.{nl}I've gotten rid of the source and he thanked me for that.{nl}
In the meantime, please hide with the mayor.{nl}Of course, the soldier who will catch the culprit should join. {nl}He should act like an observer.{nl}
Of course, we can't rule out that some of the soldiers may have had a hand in this...{nl}But, you don't have to worry since Basilius is reliable and a very close friend of mine.{nl}
Anyway, since the Lord Lieutenant found out that all the pouches were removed...{nl}He will appear again and bury the pocket.{nl}
Let's strike all at once, then.{nl}I will block the retreat route in case something happens. 
I am counting on you then.{nl}When you go, I will start my task as well.
You're safe.{nl}Don't worry, the Lord Lieutenant was caught with the villagers.{nl}
What a cruel and cunning man. Cowardly and dishonorable as well. {nl}He also ratted other soldiers out.{nl}
As I expected, they were stealing the tributes.{nl}They lured the monsters and began to steal in earnest.{nl}
He was blinded by greed and endangered everyone...{nl}I am well acquainted with the lord. Let me take the other soldiers to her.{nl}
Due to your help, I was able to keep to the schedule and start picking up the corals again.{nl}Thank you so much. You've saved us and the villagers.
After you have removed all the pouches from the Lhu'uvik Coral Reef,{nl}the number of monsters have decreased quite significantly.{nl}Such a blessing... It's truly a blessing.{nl}
But what if some pouches are still out there...{nl}The monsters are coming more slowly.
Thank you.{nl}You keep helping us.
You are a godsend to us.{nl}Without you, we would have turned into refugees once again.
You found them all? {nl}What a relief.
Hmm, maybe... This is just an idea,{nl}but how about we throw the powder from the pouches away from the pit?{nl}
Then, the monsters will be directed there. Right?{nl}Can you help us out?{nl}
Near the Atskiles Cay would be the ideal spot.{nl}Godspeed.
As mayor, it's embarrassing, but I almost gave up on everything.{nl}Whatever it is, I think we made the right choice with staying put.
A large number of monsters came? {nl}Damn it... It was very effective, but it puts us in danger.{nl}
I am so sorry to give you a hard task.{nl}I'll tell everyone not to touch the pouch.{nl}
That coral... Where did you get it?{nl}That's called Arnim. It's a very important coral used in medicine.
There must be a habitat near the place where you obtained it...{nl}
I am sorry, but can you look for their habitat?{nl}If you could look for the habitat of the Arnim coral, it would help the villagers a lot.
If you could find the habitat of the Arnim coral, it would be of great help to the villagers.
Nugara Sandbank?{nl}That deep... We will have hard time extracting it.{nl}
We better let the refugees know. We should find a way together.{nl}Thank you so much!
I am sorry, but can you help us out?{nl}A lot of us are wounded, but we're short on medicine... {nl}Things are getting worse the longer we go without help...{nl}
We've already used all the medicine the merchants could offer,{nl}and we have no way of getting any more.{nl}We can make an ointment if we have the ingredients...
Please, get me Greentoshell Shell Fragments and Blue Lapasape Mosses.{nl}With those I can make an emergency ointment for the injuries.
It's not a severe cut, but if we leave it, it will decay.{nl}There are many people hurt, but I can't do a thing...
Thank you. Thank you so much.{nl}This will help you a lot.
I am sorry. I found a small box that looked like it fell from a wrecked ship...{nl}Do you know anything about it?{nl}
Ahah... So you don't know.{nl}This is sealed with magic so it can't be opened.{nl}
Something important seems to be inside...{nl}Can you help me open the box?
The ship that this box was on probably also has the device to unseal it.{nl}But we have only found the box. So, we have no idea from which ship it came from.{nl}
It must be buried somewhere around the wrecked ship or the area near it.
What could possibly be inside it for someone to go this far to seal it?
What is this bag?{nl}
Ah, there is a small magical stone in the bag!{nl}Thank you for finding it for me.{nl}
What's going to come out? {nl}I hope it's some jewelry or an accessory...
The Lord Lieutenant was behind all this? {nl}I would teach him a lesson myself, but the lord will do a better job.{nl}
I am so sorry to disturb you...{nl}Can I ask you something?{nl}
At least we can take some comfort in the fact that we don't have to be on the run again.{nl}Our normal lives will return. This is too good to be true.
Now, everything is screwed up.{nl}Our coral picking is ruined, and our village is finished for...
Everything was suspicious.{nl}The soldiers wouldn't leave if they didn't receive tributes; does that make any sense?{nl}It's good that you solved all of this.
Although we said we'd pay on the behalf of the townspeople,{nl}the soldiers would only leave if the tributes were given.{nl}Without any means to gather the coral that composed the tributes,{nl}the townspeople couldn't catch a break...
What should we do...?{nl}We should quickly gather some coral and hurry back...
I told them that there are a lot of monsters there, but they still went and got hurt.{nl}We are so desperate, but it seems the tributes are more important for the Lord Lieutenant than people.
This pouch was buried in the spot where the smell was coming from?{nl}Let's see...
Since so many monsters are attacking, the number of wounded is increasing as well.{nl}We don't have enough medicine...
If it weren't you...
I knew it was strange.{nl}It was a smell we couldn't understand.
These are hard times.{nl}The deadline is coming up, but we can't get any coral...
Putting all of us in danger for such petty motives, truly there can't be a more vile act than that.{nl}Thank heavens, you were here to save the town.
Since the number of monsters has increased recently, I'm getting worried.{nl}They never came down this far before...
He didn't even bat an eye when they were injured.{nl}I hope the next lieutenant is nicer.
The villagers are giving up on their work because the number of monsters increased a lot.{nl}I know it's an order, but it's so unfortunate to just watch it happen.
Will it be futile no matter how hard we try...{nl}I cannot accept that we have to leave this place...
Thank you!{nl}I can work again because of you!
It was strange.{nl}We waited because we thought there must be some reason...{nl}
We were being used, but we should regret the fact that we just waited for orders.{nl}I want to apologize to the villagers if I have the opportunity.
I can't do this anymore.{nl}I tried to have a fresh start putting aside everything I've got...{nl}But, I don't know what happened.
Thank you for helping me get back to work!{nl}Humans are more scarier than monsters, sometimes.
The soldiers involved have already been evacuated and it's the lieutenant's turn next.{nl}What in the world? To think that he wanted to use monsters... {nl}It would've been much better if he used his head for a good purpose.
He will receive a big punishment from the lord.{nl}He hid a lot of corals in his bedroom.

Retrieve %s by defeating the monsters
Request for the secretive rescue
Although you've brought the research materials, Gatre seems he has more to say.
Find the cleanup box, read the manual and arrange the research materials. 
Gatre feels scared because if he acts himself, he is afraid that he may get attacked by the monsters again.  Find the cleanup box on behalf of Gatre and read the manual to arrange the objects.
Report to Gatre
In the manual, it is written that Gatre is secretly asking for the help. Go back to Gatre and and tell him that you've arranged the reseach materials after reading it thoroughly. 
It seems that Gatre understood the fact that there was request for the rescue that was written on the manual. Talk with Gatre again.
Check the abandoned document at Menka Knoll
Gatre asked you to look for the research materials that were thrown away by mistakes while reading Sarma's face. If you look at the abandoned document at Menka Knoll, you would understand whether what Gatre told you is true.
Hand over the research materials to Gatre
As you were looking at the abandoned documents, you can see there are many things that are suspicious as Gatre told you. Since you can't be confident yet, hand over the documents to Gatre and listen to his story again.
True Nature of the Research
Talk with Sarma
Gatre told you to go meet Sarma as he is looking for you. Talk to him and find out whether he knows that you were investigating on him.
Use the paralysis powder to extract Green Weldigo Blood
Sarma told you that the completion of the research is not that far away so he wants you to help his research. Use the Paralysis powder to collect the blood of Green Weldigo.
Hand them over to Sarma
You've collected enough blood of Green Weldigo. Hand them over to Sarma.
Extract %s by using the paralysis powder
Sarma asked you to prepare after receiving the list of materials from Gatre that is needed for the final experiment. While Sarma was away, talk with Gatre about the research of Sarma.
Search the lost research paper
While Sarma was away, Gatre asked you to look for the research papers of Boldas who has been unconscious. Before you do what Sarma asked you to do, look for the lost research papers. The monsters may have the research papers or they may be hidden somewhere.

Hand over the materials to Sarma
You've collected all the materials that were listed on the list of the research materials. Hand over the collected materials to Sarma who is at the entrance of the Forest of Prayer.
Sabotage the research
Return to Gatre
Sarma told you that there are some materials which Sarma has left so he asked you to get them from Gatre. While moving out from the Sarma's sight, talk with Gatre after giving him the diary of the unconscious man.
Check the lost research paper
Gatre asked you to check the lost research paper. Open the inventory and read all the lost research papers.
On the lost research paper, Sarma's experiment is written in details. Show the lost research paper to Gatre.
Although, we haven't found evidence, it is certain that Sarma is doing something wrong when we think based on the research papers. Talk with Gatre what to do next.
Look for the medicine that is similar to the ripen liquid from the research materials' storage
Gatre told you that since he ruined the research of Sarma, he should earn some time. Look for other medicine that looks similar to the ripen liquid of the fruit tree which is needed for the research.
Hand them over to Gatre
You've found the medicine that resembles the ripen liquid of the fruit tree. Go back to Gatre with the medicine.
It seems that you won't be able to distinguish the ripen liquid of the fruit tree from the water of the red lake. Talk with Gatre what to do next.
Hand over the ripen liquid of the fake fruit tree to Sarma
Gatre told you that he would look for the evidence while Sarma is focused on the experiment. Go back to Sarma with the water from the red lake.
True Nature of Sarma's Research
Fortunately, it seems that Sarma didn't notice that the ingredients have changed. Listen to him what he is trying to do next.
Use the Transmutation Magic Circle to create ductile ingredients
Sarma told you that since he prepared everything, you should just have to activate the Transmutation Magic Circle. Put the ingredients of the mixed alchemy above and in front of the tombstone that locks the magical power, release the locked magical power to make the ingredients ductile.
Hand over the completed liquid to Sarma
You've completed the liquid which Sarma told you about by using the Transmutation Magic Circle. Although, you've mixed some fake ingredients, it looks normal from the appearances. Go back to Sarma and hand over the liquid to him.
Ask Sarma what he is trying to experiment with the completed liquid.
Sprinkle the liquid onto the pile of the grass
Sarma told you that he will give you some completed liquid and asked you to wait for the results after sprinkling it on the pile of the grass. Sprinkle the completed liquid onto the pile of the grass that is located in front.
You've defeated all monsters that rushed in. Look for Gatre who followed Sarma.
Check the abandoned memo
Something is written on the abandoned memo. Check what's inside.

I'm going to give you some aged fruit tree sap.{nl}Go to the research material warehouse and find a chemical that looks like this.{nl}
It is said this steel-barred window was moved to Kalejimas a long time ago.{nl}Quite a dready object from the Kadumel Era.{nl}
Vaidotas. Do you know him?{nl}The Alchemist Master, Vaidotas, is my cousin.
You are unable to move due to a strange magic circle!
It looks like the circle was made for something evil.{nl}Let's see if there's other circles around.
I found another magic circle.{nl}I wonder if it'll disappear if we destroy the magic core?
I don't think regular stones will work.{nl}Maybe monster horns or something similar?
I think I found out how to destroy the magic circles.{nl}Let's see if there's more of them.
Are you hurt?{nl}I'm sorry. I didn't think someone would come to such unstable grounds.
I'm Kabbalist Lutas.{nl}I'm redrawing the Vera Coast magic circles as requested by the Kabbalist Master.{nl}
This area rose up from underwater during Medzio Diena, so the soil here is very weak. {nl}If it ends up being covered by the sea again, it will cause {nl}a massive earthquake affecting the whole continent.{nl}
Because of that, the Kabbalist Master drew magic circles here to stabilize the soil.{nl}With the power of Zemyna, the goddess of the earth and Jurate, the goddess of the sea.{nl}
But after sometime, I came back and the circles had faded a lot.{nl}So I told the Kabbalist Master and now I'm redrawing the magic circles.{nl}
By the way, you don't seem very affected by the Binding Magic Circle, you must be skilled. {nl}Sorry for asking, but I could use some help, actually... Would you perhaps...?
Oh no... How could this happen?{nl}The Earth Magic Circle is gone!{nl}
Could it be... the earthquake...
You destroyed the magic circle?{nl}Oh my...{nl}
I know my magic circles gave you a hard time, but this one...{nl}This one is the magic circle supporting Vera Coast!{nl}
We can't lose time. We need to draw the magic circle again!{nl}Quick, you need to gather some earth energy.
I have an earth energy collector that I installed some time ago, just in case.{nl}The Tuolo Coral Reef. I'll give you this Earth Magic Stone, just go quickly.
We have no time to stall.{nl}If we don't complete the magic circle, we could cause an earthquake as strong as Medzio Diena!{nl}
Aaargh... Another earthquake...{nl}
You're fast.{nl}Give me the earth energy. I'll take it from here.
Did you feel the ground shaking earlier? We need to hurry.{nl}After restoring the Earth Magic Circle, I'm going to take care of the the sea and balancing one.{nl}
I'm giving you a Sea Magic Stone and a balancing one.{nl}Fill them up while I try to restore the Earth Magic Circle.{nl}
Unfortunately I have no collector for these.{nl}You'll have to put down the stones and hunt monsters nearby to have them absorb their energy.{nl}
The ground was shaking again.{nl}I should hurry and complete the Sea Magic Circle.
Did you fill up the stones with energy?{nl}
I just finished the magic circle.{nl}Please wait a moment.
Finished! Now to repair the Sea Magic Circle.{nl}I'll go ahead first and start preparing.{nl}
The Sea Magic Circle is in Khanka Sentry.{nl}You know where it is, right? We'll meet there.
Thanks to you I was able to draw the circle in time.{nl}Now I just need to finish the Balancing Magic Circle and it should be fine.
I drew the Balancing Magic Circle in advance before coming back.{nl}All we need to do is add the balancing energy to it.{nl}
The Balancing Magic Circle is at the Garama Sandbank, past the Bachl Vacant Lot.{nl}Let's go.
Ugh... I can't walk anymore.{nl}I'm sorry, I'm a disgrace...
But there's no time to waste.{nl}The Balancing Magic Circle needs to be completed as soon as possible...{nl}
I think I'm going to have to give you the balancing stone.{nl}I'll be fine if I rest for a while, you go ahead and complete the magic circle. Please.
We're wasting time. Go now. Go...
You did great.{nl}You stopped an immense tragedy from happening.{nl}
Vera Coast should be safe from being submerged now.{nl}I'm going to look into the conditions of the soil a little more and go back to the Kabbalist Master.{nl}Thank you for your help.
Thank you!{nl}If you could keep the monsters away while I draw the circle again, I'll be much appreciated.{nl}
I was just about to go to the Earth Magic Circle. Come with me.
The Sea Magic Circle only needs energy of the sea.{nl}On the Balancing Magic Circle you need to add both earth and sea energy.
For the Sea Magic Stone, make sure you fill it only with sea energy.{nl}Be careful not to mix sea and earth energy.
Ah... wait!{nl}I think there's a problem...{nl}
Looking at the new magic circles, the Earth Magic Circle looks a little weaker than the others.{nl}I think there might have been a problem with the energy collector.{nl}
I want to absorb some energy directly from monsters {nl}like what we did with the other magic circles.{nl}Can you help me?
Just be careful.{nl}Make sure the sea energy doesn't mix with the earth energy.
Thank you.{nl}I'll repair the Earth Magic Circle now.
Hmm... I can't help but worry about all these monsters around.{nl}But magic circle protective magic doesn't work on monsters.{nl}
I should probably make more Binding Magic Circles around.{nl}I'm sorry, but just help me with this one last thing!
When the new magic circles are completed, they disappear after a while.{nl}Don't worry about stepping on them, though, they only react to monsters.
The new Binding Magic Circles are ready? {nl}Thank you.{nl}
What? Nothing happens when the monsters step on them?{nl}Ah... Maybe they need time to activate.{nl}Don't worry about it.{nl}
Now that I think about it, the Binding Magic Circles I made before were too dangerous. {nl}Even you had a close call with them.{nl}
I think it's best to get rid of any danger.{nl}It's the last thing I'm asking you.
The Magic Searching Stone is too old so sometimes it doesn't detect magic circles that well.
Thanks for your help.{nl}It should be safe for anyone who comes here now.
I'm going to give you a Magic Searching Stone.{nl}Use it to find any hidden Binding Magic Circles.{nl}
The magic circles you found will fade away with time.{nl}Luring monsters into the circles isn't a bad option either.{nl}
The magic circles do disappear when you step on them, {nl}but there's no need to do anything dangerous.
Oh, make sure you add only sea energy to the Sea Magic Circle.{nl}The balancing one needs both earth and sea energy.
Make sure you don't get them mixed up.{nl}
Thanks to you Vera Coast is stable now.{nl}Thank you.
There are three small magic circles at the Bachl Vacant Lot.{nl}If something happens to the magic circles, those circles will also react.
There doesn't seem to be a reaction.
Are you sure? Thank you!{nl}The method is the same as before.{nl}
I'm going to give you an Earth Magic Stone; just put it down and defeat monsters.{nl}Also, make sure to fill it only with earth energy.
Oh, don't worry.{nl}I made it so that it only works with monsters.{nl}
This is a Binding Magic Circle scroll.{nl}Take it and create Binding Magic Circles around the new circles.

Oh, this is it.{nl}Just a wait a while.
Finished.{nl}I had to rush it so it's not too stable, but it's definitely powerful.
Now, for the next step.{nl}We need to set up this bomb somewhere the demons will walk by.
Will you?{nl}Let's go together, then.
Be careful with it.{nl}I did manage to enhance the bomb, but since I had to rush it, it's not very stable.
Thank you so much.{nl}Now... the operation begins.
What are you doing? Why don't you run?{nl}We disobeyed the demons, they'll be here any second!
Do you really mean it?{nl}You want us to... defeat the demons together?{nl}
We were going to hurt you!{nl}I thought you would at least resent us... instead you make humbled criminals of us.{nl}
Alright.{nl}If I'm going to die, I might as well repent to you while I can.{nl}The thing that worries me is that... everyone is terrified of Centaurus.
I realised what it is we were missing.{nl}You awoke that in us.{nl}
Yes... I remember now.{nl}We are the Royal Army!
Never did we imagine an operation of this caliber.{nl}With someone as strong as you on our side, I'm not afraid to put my life at risk.{nl}
My plan is to attract as many demons as possible to the trap to reduce their numbers.{nl}But we can't let a monster get caught instead and ruin the plan.{nl}
The operation is taking place at Uzsaldi Plateau.{nl}Will you take care of the monsters around the trap?{nl}
This trap wasn't easy to set, it would be a shame to see it ruined by monsters.{nl}I'm counting on you.
Slowly we're getting ready to fight the demons.
First we need to lure the demons with wooden fences.{nl}The soldiers are busy with other tasks, so I want to ask you to do it.
My debt to you just keeps growing.{nl}You can get the fences from the supplies box in front of Herntas.
If only we can make this work...{nl}We could finally escape the clutches of the demons.
Are the fences ready?{nl}Good.{nl}
Now we just need Soldier Callans to set up the trap to begin the operation...{nl}He's a little late.{nl}It'd be great if you could help him, just in case.
Alright. We're ready.{nl}The soldiers sent to spread false information to the demons already reported back, too.{nl}
They say Centaurus is coming this way.{nl}And apparently he's furious.{nl}
Everything's running smoothly.{nl}I just hope we succeed...
Is it... over?{nl}I can finally return as soldier of the Kingdom... It's been so hard...{nl}
I would have lived a miserable life if it weren't for you.{nl}Thank you!
We might have escaped the demons, but this is far from over.{nl}They probably don't even know we're alive back in the Kingdom...{nl}
We need a way to contact the Kingdom!{nl}Then we can think about going back to our families.{nl}
But how do we tell them about this...{nl}It's not easy.
Are you talking about Uska from Klaipeda?{nl}If so, then... please, do me the favor!{nl}
Telling Uska about what happened to our troops should be enough.{nl}That and... we're ready to take responsibility for the things we did.
You mean the troops were still alive?{nl}That's a relief to hear.{nl}
We ought to get them back to their hometowns but...{nl}Given the urgency of their situation, we will first make sure to send them supplies.{nl}
Thank you for reporting this information.{nl}
Hopefully Uska will be able to help us...{nl}As for our punishment... I'm not sure.{nl}
You have no idea how we feel right now.
Uska is sending us supplies?{nl}That's a relief. To think I can go back to my hometown too...{nl}
And...{nl}No word about our punishment?{nl}
You left that out on purpose?{nl}You really... I get why there's no match for the Revelators now.{nl}
I'm sorry... and thank you for speaking on behalf of our troops!{nl}Your favor will not be forgotten.
Soldier Guylens
There's nowhere colder than this place.
Thanks to you we defeated Centaurus...{nl}But his vassals are still around.{nl}
Our soldiers are too exhausted from the battle.{nl}But now that we have freedom... we need to protect it at all costs...
Will you really?{nl}My debt to you just keeps growing.
Here we have to battle not just monsters but the freezing cold, so it's never easy.
If only we can pull through this...{nl}There'll be nothing else holding us down!
You brought us a lot of relief, but I'm still worried about the remaining vassals.
Who're you?{nl}The monsters are coming.{nl}Aren't you going to run away like those cowardly soldiers?{nl}
Me?{nl}I'm going to try and pull through it.
Wow, you're pretty good.{nl}Defeating that huge monster all by yourself, now that's impressive!
Oh, I just remembered.{nl}I was supposed to finish my damage report but the monsters got me distractred.{nl}
I'm sorry, but would you take care of the wounded miners for me?{nl}You can use the herbs from before to make the antiseptic.{nl}Sorry for the trouble.
The miners are over to the left.{nl}Thank you!
Soldier Andre
If we do nothing, all my fellow soldiers could die.
We need to save them as soon as possible...
Let's see... I don't think we have enough people for the Dimensional Stone.{nl}What do we do...
There weren't enough of us to stop all the demons coming out of Kaleimas.
We would have been exterminated if it weren't for Assistant Commander Vilas.
How's the healing process?{nl}Looks like you talked to the miners, too.{nl}Thank you.
As you know, we're too short on people.{nl}Especially since the soldiers, who we need the most, all ran away in fear.{nl}
If only we knew where the Dimensional Stone was, I think we can make do with the workers we have...{nl}The problem is the monsters.{nl}Nothing but an annoyance...{nl}
If you help us out with this, we can do the rest.{nl}For now I marked some areas that look promising.{nl}
Lezsa Hill has the highest probability.{nl}Go there and use this detector to find the Dimensional Stone.{nl}
Make sure to mark the spot so we can find it later.
If it weren't for the monsters it would be a lot easier.{nl}As for the demons... I don't even want to talk about those.
You really saved us here.{nl}Your help has been precious to the Kedora Alliance.{nl}
Oh, and I'm very grateful for your help, {nl}but please don't tell anyone about the Dimensional Stone.{nl}Last time some baron opened this weird door and... let's just say it wasn't pretty.{nl}
I guess that's it...{nl}You're a Revelator, we're followers of the goddess; {nl}I'm sure we'll meet again.
Why did we come to this dangerous place, you wonder...{nl}First of all, I work for the Kedora Merchant Alliance.{nl}
This is actually a secret, but anyways.{nl}If I tell you this then you'll have to help us out, though.{nl}
So, what do you say? It'd be great if you could help.{nl}It's all in the name of the goddess, no personal gains to be had from this.
If you're a Revelator I think it's fine to tell you anyways. {nl}It's all because of the Dimensional Stone, you see.{nl}With it, you can travel between dimensions.{nl}
I see you're not getting it.{nl}Neither do we, actually.{nl}
We at the Kedora Alliance are just doing as the goddess told us.{nl}She said the world needed us, so we're just fulfilling that role as best as we can.{nl}
If the demons get ahold of it we know it's not gonna end well so we've been working in secret...{nl}But our workers and soldiers all ran away, in fear of the monsters.{nl}
Even if we send out a letter for more personnel, it's gonna take a while.{nl}The only miner workers left are terrified as well... We're in big trouble.{nl}
Good.{nl}First, would you clear out some monsters around here?{nl}We can't have another one like before coming our way.
Thank you for helping the Kedora Alliance.{nl}I knew finding the Dimensional Stone was gonna be hard. {nl}I never thought I'd have to risk my life over it.
I think they've calmed down now.{nl}Now, shall we start...?
What is it?{nl}Is it because I look like I'm doing something different from everybody else?{nl}
Well of course.{nl}As the competent wizard I am, I was specifically hired by the Alliance.{nl} So yes, my work here is different.{nl}
Can't you tell?{nl}I'm researching ores, of course.{nl}
If you have time to be asking, why don't you be useful and help me?{nl}Oh, right.{nl}
I need something similar to glass.{nl}Blue Cronewt Needler Crystals.{nl}
I need to analyze the ore's components, but I can't do that without the crystals.{nl}Understood?{nl}Go on, then.
I wouldn't be this mad if my bag hadn't been completely destroyed by monsters.{nl}What are you doing?{nl}Hurry and get me the crystals.
The Kedora Alliance was too slow and the monsters took over...{nl}Bad luck all over.{nl}Now, give that to me already.{nl}
Let's see, hm...{nl}The Dimensional Stone is full of impurities...{nl}I wonder what they're made of...{nl}
What?{nl}You want to know about the Dimensional Stone?{nl}Does that mean you were... eavesdropping earlier?{nl}
Alright.{nl}I'll tell you, just tone down your voice.{nl}
Jamelhan says this plain-looking stone has the power to cross dimensions.{nl}Isn't it exciting?{nl}
I think that if used correctly... {nl}The Dimensional Stone can take us to the place where the goddesses are.{nl}I have no idea how to use its power, though.{nl}
Since you helped me find out about the impurities in the Stone...{nl}I guess I can start to find out more about it now.{nl}
You aren't just gonna leave after I told you all of that, are you?{nl}Why don't you give me a hand here?
These impurities can interfere with the power of the Dimensional Stone,{nl} so they need to be removed.{nl}That'll be easier if I can find out what the impurities are made of.{nl}
I'm going to extract some pure magic from Magic Stones and have it react with the impurities.{nl}I should be able to infer what they're made of depending on how they react.{nl}
There are some Magic Stones south of the stairs in these hills. Would you get me some?
Did you bring back some stones?{nl}Or didn't you leave yet?
These should be enough.{nl}I'll use the stones you brought to find out just what these impurities are.
I found out what the Dimensional Stone's impurities are made of.{nl}In order to extract them, hm... It's a little complicated, but I need some materials.
Luckily all I need is from monsters, which definitely aren't lacking around here.{nl}I'll give you a scroll.{nl}
Use this on monsters to temporarily alter their essence, and then...{nl}you need to defeat them.{nl}
Collect their essence and bring it to me.
The effects of the scroll don't last too long.{nl}It was made in a rush, so please understand.
You're back. Thank you.{nl}Now I just need... some samples.
I need to know what the Dimensional Stone reacts to.{nl}So I want to test it on some samples.{nl}
The samples aren't a problem... The problem is the reagent. I don't have enough.{nl}Would you go to Gado Way and collect some Tini Salivary Glands?
Bring them to me as soon as you get them.
None of this would be a problem if I still had my bag.{nl}Where are those glands? Is it gonna take long?
Here they are, Tini Salivary Glands.{nl}I'm still a little short on research supplies, but I'll get by on my own from now on.
This story has been told in our village since long ago.{nl}Our village was built by the workers from Kaleimas Prison, a prison nearby.{nl}
Their peace didn't last long... an epidemic started to spread one day.{nl}The skin would fall off the body, it was a gruesome disease...{nl}
Thankfully Maven, who was passing by, cured the disease with a holy relic...{nl}And that relic has been passed on by the people of our village ever since...{nl}
But now... Not long ago, Demon Centaurus appeared with his vassals.{nl}He raised statues around the village and cursed it with a disease...{nl}
We created a Purification Sphere with Maven's holy relic and succeeded in destroying some of the statues.{nl}But of course, Centaurus did not like that...{nl}
We thought they would end us, but all they did was destroy the Sphere.{nl}It's as if they're observing the disease.{nl}
We suffer every day...{nl}Our lives cannot end under the demons' watch, but they can't go on under it, either.{nl}
Please, I beg you...{nl}Rid us of the cursed statues and the demons, and cure us of this disease.
The person who defeated that group of demons... was you?{nl}
Oh... Arntas.{nl}I can't tell if ending the curse is possible now...
Your plan is to destroy the village's surveillance spheres, right?{nl}I'm afraid we have no choice, considering our situation.{nl}
My body hasn't recovered yet... Please go to Dvejoti Cliff for me and collect black stones.{nl}There's a lot of monsters there so be careful.
There was a demon attack and some soldiers still can't leave the base.
They need to be rescued.
We were all just waiting for the day we would return to the goddess...{nl}Can we really escape the curse this time?
You're back.{nl}Can I have them?{nl}It's time to give them hell.
There, it's finished.{nl}I had to rush it so it's a little rough; please be careful with it.
Just set up the bomb by the surveillance sphere and run to a safe place.{nl}I used up all the black stones on it, so there's no way to control the power.{nl}
If it works, go see Priest Chaleims.{nl}We almost succeeded once, so he knows what to do next; he will let you know.
I don't want to live like this anyore.{nl}If we fail again this time I'll...
That was a nice explosion!{nl}Now to make the Purification Sphere before the demons get here.
You did it!{nl}Hurry and go to Priest Chaleims!
This isn't the first time I'm making a Purification Sphere, it won't be difficult.{nl}I do require some materials, however... Would you bring me some White Spion essence?
I'll stay here and prepare.{nl}If we fail this time... we'll never be able to escape this life.
You did well.{nl}We have the materials now, all we need is divine energy to make the Purification Sphere.
We need the divine energy from Maven's holy relic... to charge the sphere with it.{nl}Originally the sphere was in our village...{nl}
But the demons took it to Sventimas Exile and Kadumel Cliff.{nl}That's how powerful Maven's divine energy was.{nl}
A lot of time has passed now, the divine force in it will have weakened.{nl}It's buried under the snow, thankfully, so the demons can't see it.{nl}
Thank you.{nl}Artnas will give you the detection orb and absorption orb.{nl}
This is the most important step of our plan...{nl}I pray for your success.
To think that, once again, we're using the Maven relics...{nl}I wonder if Maven knew then?
You collected the energy.{nl}That's splendid!{nl}
And yet... No news of Artnas.{nl}I hope nothing serious has happened... Hmm...
If you find Artnas, please come back to the village.{nl}We don't know what the demons will do if they find out we destroyed their surveillance sphere.
Thankfully Arntas was just a little startled and will recover with some rest.{nl}The demons seem to have caught on to us however, it would be best to move.{nl}
We'll make the Purification Sphere at the altar in Besde Shores.{nl}I will see you there.
You came.{nl}The monsters and the demons seem to have found out that we're up to something.{nl}
Please keep an eye out while I make the Purification Sphere.
Finished!{nl}The Purification Sphere is complete!
All that's left now is destroying the cursed statues.{nl}Take the Purification Sphere to the statues and the divine energy within it will destroy them.{nl}
The problem is the statues are being guarded by an army of demons.{nl}The only one able to get pass them... is you.{nl}
If there's any hope left for us, that's you.{nl}Please... free us from this unbearable misery.
You've done it!{nl}At last... we're free from our dreadful misery...{nl}
But it's not over yet.{nl}There are three more cursed statues in Kadumel Cliff.{nl}
All three must be destroyed in order to end the curse.{nl}And if the demons find out your identity, they'll only make things harder for us.{nl}
So please!{nl}Please... destroy the remaining statues.{nl}
A bomb?{nl}With the right materials, sure, I can make a bomb.{nl}
My skin is still burnt but...{nl}If this curse ever ends I'll help you with whatever you need.
Really?{nl}My... The goddess did not abandon us...{nl}
First we need to destroy the surveillance spheres in the village so we can move freely.{nl}They were set up by the demons to monitor us.{nl}
We've tried before, but were caught by the demons.{nl}But you... I know you can do it if you try.{nl}
Go meet Argis at the village.{nl}He knows about bombs, he can help you.
What are you doing in this cursed place?{nl}Everyone in this village is suffering from a horrendous disease.{nl}
I wish I could at least relieve the pain...{nl}But I'm too ill to even go looking for herbs...{nl}
Do you mean it?{nl}You don't know how thankful I am...{nl}
Bring me some Sikljien herbs if you can.{nl}They grow on the edge of Kadumel Cliff.
I'm in so much pain... it hurts to even move.{nl}The most I can do is cool my fever with the cold breeze.
I'm sick of constantly talking about how much I'm suffering.{nl}But these herbs... I'm grateful for them.
We're already suffering from the curse, and now the monsters...{nl}Please.{nl}I just want my mind to be at ease...
I can't even escape from this village.{nl}Because of the demons...
Thank you!{nl}Now if only this curse were to disappear...
Eugh... Run!{nl}The demons are coming!
You saved my life.{nl}Seeing you defeat all those demons... There's no way you're just a normal person.
We're being mercilessly attacked by demons from Kalejimas Prison.{nl}Our troops were retreating back towards Sventimas Exile.{nl}
But then we were caught in an ambush and only three of us managed to escape this way.{nl}
I want to go and rescue the rest of our troops but...{nl}I'm tired from the battle and I'm wounded...
You say you're going to save our troops?{nl}That's extremely brave of you but...
{nl}We're incredibly outnumbered!{nl}Do you still want to go...?
{nl}Alright.{nl}Our troops will be at the Smekla Base, unable to move.{nl}
The way to the Base is occupied by demons, so be careful.{nl}
You're my only hope now.{nl}Please... save our troops.
Assistant Commander Vilas
A civilian?{nl}How does a civilian end up here?{nl}
Who are you?
I hope everyone's safe...
I see. Andre...{nl}By the way, did you see anything that looks like a black wall on your way here?{nl}
You passed through the black wall?{nl}How on earth did you do that?{nl}
We're can't move from here because we couldn't pass over that wall.{nl}We'll never get away from here unless we find a way.{nl}
We need to know what that wall is so we can either destroy it or break through it.{nl}So we sent Scout Boas to the Lamdyti Workshop.{nl}
If you help Boas, we can find out a lot faster.{nl}Please do me that favor.
Scout Boas
Are you a demon?!{nl}Reveal yourself!!{nl}
Oh, you were sent by Assistant Commander Vilas?{nl}But... how did you pass through the black wall...?
I mean, that's not important now.{nl}But that black wall... it's definitely strange.{nl}
I saw some demons guarding an unknown magic device down the road south of the Lamdyti Workshop.{nl}I wonder if that has anything to do with it...{nl}
I did try to blow it up with a bomb, but it didn't even budge.{nl}I think we need something more powerful.{nl}
I'll go and get more bombs.{nl}Meanwhile, will you gather some black stones?{nl}
The black stones around here are good for enhancing bombs.{nl}Please do me that favor.
You got the stones.{nl}I'll get them ready in no time.{nl}Just wait a little while.
I think they're powerful enough now.{nl}Now, to destroy the magic device.{nl}You go first, I'll catch up soon.
I think this time we can destroy it.{nl}The thing is... what if the problem is not the magic device?
I knew it!{nl}There's no way that would survive my bombs.{nl}
I wonder if the wall is gone now... We should go back to the troops!
You're just who I wanted to see!{nl}The black wall disappeared and we're ready to retreat.
Are we out now...?{nl}Thanks to you we all managed to retreat in safety.{nl}
Losing to the demons in Steel Heights was a shame but...{nl}At least we get to live to see tomorrow.{nl}
By the way...{nl}Are you perhaps headed to Kalejimas Prison?{nl}
Be careful if go that way.{nl}The demons who nearly finished us all came from there.{nl}
Anyways, I have to thank you.{nl}May the grace of the goddess be with you!
Every time the wind blows it feels like my flesh is being ripped apart.
I'm suddenly reminded of my parents' potato dumplings.
Soldier Hyrance
How much longer will we have to stay here...?
Soldier Kuijlen
This unbearable cold is a bigger enemy to us than the monsters themselves.
This place is unbearably cold and full of dangerous monsters.
Soldier Heulen
How much longer do we have to stay...? I want to go home now.
The monsters, the cold... I'm so exhausted.
I feel extremely thankful and sorry for the soldiers who have endured this far.
I'm so grateful to these soldiers who always follow my orders even in these harsh conditions.
If we didn't do as the demons said we'd be dead by now.
Being threatened by the demons was really hard on us.
We were determined to refuse when the demons offered to give us supplies in exchange for killing the Revelator, but when they threatened to kill us instead if we didn't do it, we had no choice but to obey.
We wanted to resist the demons, but we knew that we couldn't defeat them.
We didn't want to kill anyone... {nl}But we also didn't want to die.
Now we're as good as dead anyway.
You should run while you still can.
I'm really sorry. We would be dead if we had refused to obey the demons.
If only we weren't short on supplies, this wouldn't have happened...
After we accepted the demons' orders, we prayed that no one would come to Ibre Plateau.
We're just as good as dead to the demons now.
When we stopped getting supplies, I wanted to run away. {nl}But I couldn't bear to leave my fellow soldiers behind.
We'd be dead if we hadn't obeyed the demons.
I wonder why the Assistant Commander wants to see us.
What does the Assistant Commander want to say to us?
The Assistant Commander must have something important to say to us.
It sounds like the Assistant Commander has made an important decision.{nl}We'll have to go and see him.
I think the Assistant Commander made a decision.
I wonder why the Assistant Commander wants to see us.
We're the Kedora Merchant Alliance.{nl}We supplied materials to the Great Cathedral, the Mage Tower, the Great Goddess Statue in Fedimian, and many other historical construction projects.{nl}
You could say we're the backbone of history itself.
Everything we thrive for is the will of the goddess.
Mine Worker
I came all the way here on the promise of a high pay...{nl}I had no idea it would be this dangerous.
I wouldn't have applied if I knew how dangerous this place was...
They didn't even hire a soldier to protect us, how can they ask us to work here?
I managed to survive the monster attack, but some experimentation tools were destroyed.
If it weren't for that attack I wouldn't be having such a hard time right now.
We managed to ward off the demons earlier but if they attack again we'll be completely exterminated.
We don't have enough soldiers to survive another attack from the demons.
The black wall disappeared. We're able to retreat now.
We should leave before the demons attack again.
Right, right. Are you by chance the Revelator?{nl}I heard that someone called the Revelator came to Fedimian and is helping other people.{nl}
As expected.{nl}I can see why you're so talented now.{nl}It seems the goddesses haven't abandoned us yet!
The smell and the monsters...{nl}I think I'm on to something.
Dievdirbys Asel
You... I don't think we've met before.{nl}Sorry for being so direct, but can I ask you a favor?{nl}
I was attacked by monsters on my way here.{nl}I should have chased them away but... I can't move now.
Oh! Thank you.{nl}You can bring me some herbs then. I now a type that's good for wounds.{nl}
Although I'm not too familiar with this area.{nl}But the owl sculptures in Zaliavin Valley should know where to find those herbs.{nl}
I hate that I can't move because of the monsters...{nl}And that I have to ask this favor to a stranger... I'm sorry.
The broken owl sculptures you see around here... They don't answer when you talk to them.
You say the owl sculptures are broken and don't answer?{nl}What on earth happened there...?{nl}
I'm actually here by request of the Dievdirbys Master.{nl}I was tasked with checking the condition of the statues, so I come here about once a month.{nl}
I don't think they would be attacked by monsters...{nl}Strange. I should go there myself.
The owl sculptures aren't answering.
If these statues aren't repaired soon, the number of lost spirits will only grow bigger.{nl}But I'm barely able to stand as it is... This is some problem we have here.
I'm so sorry.{nl}You're the only one I can depend on right now so I have to ask.{nl}
Please do me this favor.
This is terrible.{nl}I feel a strange energy, too...{nl}
I'll have a look; please wait here.
Uh? Why are there cuts on the backs of the statues...?{nl}There's an evil energy coming from here. This is not the work of monsters...
I wonder if it's a curse...{nl}It looks like the evil energy is attracting monsters to this area.
This won't be easy, it seems.{nl}It's hard enough to deal with evil energy, but the big problem is repairing the statues.{nl}
Not only do they have cuts, there's broken parts here and there that need to be fixed.{nl}Even with the right materials... the chances look slim.{nl}
Thank you for your precious help.{nl}I'll ask you to gather some sticky liquid and broken bows from monsters nearby.
I'm still very wounded, but I can deal with the repair job.{nl}What kind of Dievdirbys would I be if I couldn't?
Oh, you got them.{nl}I'll just tend to the cuts and broken parts and we can move on to the purification.{nl}
My body feels like it's about to return to the goddess...{nl}I just hope I have enough strength to repair the statues.{nl}
I've never seen anything like this.{nl}The evil energy isn't disappearing. This could be a curse more powerful than anything I know...{nl}
I need to observe the other statues to look for clues, but it's impossible like this.{nl}May I ask you to gather some herbs for me that I can use as a painkiller?
Thank you, I'll trust you to do it.{nl}You can bring me some Yellow Sapous, they're found on the north side of the valley.
I'd get proper treatment if only the statues were okay...{nl}This was all very unexpected.
Thank you. For all your favors.{nl}I think, however... there's something strange here...{nl}
I've seen many statues destroyed by demons or broken by monsters...{nl}But none had this awful curse that won't disappear.
I should check the other statues, anyways.{nl}I can move to some extent now, I just pray that the goddess will help me make it.{nl}
I'm going to rest for a while before I head to Miglos Hill, what about you?{nl}But you don't have to worry about me.
Will you?{nl}I'm grateful to have someone as talented as you accompany me, of course!{nl}
If you can, go and clear out some monsters on the way to Miglos Hill.{nl}Thank you!
I'll follow you once the painkiller takes effect.{nl}I'll meet you at Miglos Hill, then.
Cuts. And that evil energy...{nl}This owl sculpture is in the same condition as the other.{nl}
You would need serious skill to make these cuts.{nl}And to handle such powerful evil energy, too.{nl}
Who could have done this?{nl}Could it be a demon... or someone with other intents?{nl}
For now I'll try and purify it.{nl}Will you take care of the other owl sculptures?{nl}
Thank you.{nl}You can go to the Raucous Owl Sculpture in Skardus Hill.{nl}
We'll have a big problem at hands if that statue is affected by evil energy too...{nl}Good luck.
Raucous Owl Sculpture
Did Asel sent you here?{nl}What a relief!
I was worried since none of the other statues are responding; I think they're asleep.{nl}Oh, right... I just remembered something.{nl}
Not long ago my friends said they saw a strange little girl.{nl}She had an odd energy to her.{nl}
I think that's when it happened.{nl}I wonder if the girl has anything to do with them being asleep.
This is going to take a while...{nl}Please take care of the Raucous Owl Sculpture in Skardus Hill.
A girl, you say... I have no idea.{nl}I don't think she would be responsible for this, though.{nl}
Maybe the owl sculpture in the training camp knows something.{nl}Meet me at the Grynas Training Camp.{nl}
Can my friends ever wake up again?{nl}I want to at least protect them from the monsters... Would you help me just a little bit?
Thank you!{nl}I'll make some crystals that can protect my friends.{nl}
A little over Skardus Hill you'll find Spirit Stones.{nl}They're red and sparkly.{nl}
Please collect some stones and also ritual pouches used by Stoulets.{nl}I need the powder inside.
Asel can wake them up, right?{nl}I hope the others won't hurt anymore.{nl}
You got the materials!{nl}I'll use them to make the protective crystals.
Finished.{nl}Will you put them next to my friends?
Please put three crystals around each statue.{nl}There's bound to be monsters around so you'll have to clear them out, too.
Luckily I'm here isolated and nothing happened to me.{nl}Who could have done such a thing...?
Thank you.{nl}The crystals will protect my friends for a while so I can put my heart at ease.
You did say that there was evil energy around the cuts on the statues, right?{nl}They must have been bitten by monsters...{nl}
Even with the crystals protecting them, wouldn't it be better to get rid of everything harmful?{nl}I'm just worried, you see...
Really? Thank you!{nl}Please clear out some monsters around the statues, then.
Luckily I was left unscathed but...{nl}My friends aren't that vulnerable, who could have done that to them?
Thank you.{nl}I hope my friends wake up soon...
You're here.{nl}This is the place where Dievdirbys have been training since the old days.{nl}
Not long ago, however, it was attacked by Sequoia.{nl}The very Sequoia created by Tesla, the one that was taken by evil energies.{nl}
After they took everyone to a safe place and began to take care of the wounded, this area became empty.{nl}
I'll ask the other Dievdirbys about the owl sculptures...{nl}Meanwhile, please have a look at the statue.
If I remember correctly, it will be at the Bevertis Crossroads.{nl}I will see you later.
Hasty Owl Sculpture
Help!{nl}I think all my friends are asleep, they're not responding...{nl}
Asel is here too?{nl}He must know, then! About the girl, that is.{nl}
A girl was here not long ago... She had a really warm energy.{nl}But after meeting with her, all my friends suddenly fell asleep...{nl}
You should go see the Lonely Owl Sculpture.{nl}She's on a high spot at the end of a broken path, she could have seen something.{nl}
We can only hope that the information we need is here.{nl}There are too many things that don't seem right.
Did you find something?{nl}
All the owl sculptures that saw the girl are now asleep... Hm.{nl}I'm afraid the Dievdirbys here don't know much, either.
I don't think the girl did anything wrong.{nl}Her energy... it was so warm, you see.
I'll ask the Dievdirbys if any of them saw the girl.{nl}Will you go see the Lonely Owl Sculpture at the broken path?
Lonely Owl Sculpture
St-stay away!{nl}Or else I'll...{nl}
What? Dievdirbys Asel sent you here?{nl}I was so scared...
A girl... That's odd.{nl}I should investigate a little more.
Oh, that girl... I know about her.{nl}Not long ago I saw a girl being chased by someone around here.{nl}
It was a man I'd never seen before.{nl}He looked so evil and terrifying... I was really very scared...{nl}
That's about the time my friends started to fall asleep.{nl}
From up here I can't see that well because of the trees but...{nl}My friends down the road maybe know more than I do.{nl}
You can follow this path down to Grubus Highway.{nl}I don't know if that statue is asleep though... I'm a little worried.{nl}
There was a man chasing the girl?{nl}Then one of them must have put the curse on the owl sculptures.{nl}
Now that I think of it, that evil energy would have been difficult to endure for a human...{nl}But we should keep all possibilities open.
The owl sculpture is covered in cuts and... also sleeping.
My friends started to fall asleep not long after I saw that man...{nl}I was really scared then...
The Grubus Highway owl sculpture is also asleep... Hm.{nl}This won't do. We need to do something.{nl}
Tesla told me about something called a purifying sculpture, but it's complicated...{nl}If I make the sculpture, will you find some materials for the purification?
Fight some Black Old Kepas and get their stems.{nl}Then meet me in front of the Sleeping Owl Sculpture.
You're back faster than I thought.{nl}Just wait a while. This may be complicated but it won't take long.
The only thing is... I don't think I can do this alone in my current state.{nl}I can do the hard part, but you'll have to support me.{nl}
All you need to do is purify any evil energy with the sculpture.{nl}Meanwhile I'll block the places where the energy is coming from.{nl}
This is not the time to be talking!{nl}Please, the purification!
I'm sorry. It looks like I failed...{nl}Just what are those cuts...? I need to find another way.{nl}
I should go see the last training camp owl sculpture.{nl}I'll go first; you follow me.
Fortunately... this statue is not asleep because of the curse.{nl}It must be worn out from using too much divine force.
It should be fine if we replenish its power.{nl}I hope this time we can find out something about the cuts...{nl}
I'm going to give you an orb and I want you to fill it with the life force of defeated monsters.{nl}With the help of the orb the statue should recover fast.
There are no cuts or evil energy.{nl}But the statue seems fast asleep.
It should be fine if we replenish its power.{nl}I hope this time we can find out something about the cuts...{nl}
Good, thank you.{nl}We should be able to wake up the owl sculpture now.
Did... Did I fall asleep?{nl}The girl and the man? What happened to them?
So, that day... Yes, that's right.{nl}It was a dark night.{nl}
A man I'd never seen was chasing a girl.{nl}I'm sure he was a human, but his energy was like a demon's...{nl}
It was really scary.{nl}The girl was right in front of me when the man almost caught her... then, something strange happened.{nl}
The girl, she...{nl}She used the divine force in me to push the man far away.{nl}
That's when I lost all my strength and fell asleep...{nl}I don't know what happened next...{nl}
It's still all very unclear.{nl}But I think we can assume it wasn't the girl who hurt the statues.{nl}
Still... something doesn't fit.{nl}All the statues said that the man was human...{nl}
I doubt that a human could endure such powerful evil energy.{nl}They could be using some sort of unusual method to do it...{nl}
Our last hope is the owl sculpture on the Hills.{nl}Meet me there. This time we must get a definitive answer.{nl}
I was really scared.{nl}Such an evil energy... I never felt anything like that.
I can't believe it was coming from a human...
Trainee Leryd
We're not in our best condition right now.{nl}A lot of trainees got hurt during the Sequoia attack.{nl}
Still, we can't stop our training, right?{nl}I'm sorry, but could I ask you a small favor?
Thank you!{nl}I want to ask you to collect some items from monsters around this area.{nl}
Everything you can collect will be very useful to us!
I never thought I would one day see the Sequoia with my own two eyes.{nl}And we thought we could put our training to use and face it but.... It was horrible.
You're back already?{nl}Amazing. These will be very useful for our training!
Dievdirbys Ruthalen
I'm just really upset.{nl}First there was the Sequoia attack, now the Ridimeds are wreaking havoc.{nl}
They're very cunning and always move in groups so it's hard to catch them.{nl}I'm sorry, but would you help?
Thank you for helping.{nl}They actually don't show up that easily, so we might need some preparation.{nl}
I'm talking about a bait, specifically the fruits that Ridimeds like.{nl}I'll stay here and prepare; you can collect the fruits from piles of greenery. They'll have a peculiar scent.
Crafting wood, materials...{nl}They'll bite anything they see, even people.{nl}
We'll show them right this time.
This should do.{nl}Let's set up the bait for the Ridimeds now.
I'll start cooking the fruits over fire like I said.{nl}Please take care of any Ridimeds that show up.
Thank you for your help.{nl}I can feel safe for a while now knowing all the Ridimeds in the area are gone.
Did you happen to see two old carving knives around here?{nl}They're very dear to me, you see...{nl}
Oh! That's the knife!{nl}But the other one...{nl}
It was a gift from my parents, I really can't lose it...
If you find that knife, please return it to me.{nl}My name will be carved on the handle.
Yes! That's my knife!{nl}Thank you for bringing my precious knife back to me. Thank you!
Dievdirbys Aisol
Oh, Asel told me about you.{nl}He is really impressed with your talent.{nl}
Things are a bit rough here because of the Sequoia attack.{nl}If that's okay, I would like to ask for your help... What do you say?
Wow, thank you.{nl}What happened here was... well, the Sequoia attacked our training camp.{nl}
Did you know?{nl}The Sequoia was created by Tesla, the Dievdirbys Master, to protect the owl sculptures.{nl}
But it was corrupted by the evil energy at Karolis Springs.{nl}This all happened a long time ago...{nl}
Now the Sequoia came with other monsters and started to wreak havoc here.{nl}And... that's about it.{nl}
First I'll ask you to clear out some monsters around here.{nl}They came with the Sequoia and are very persistent.
We don't know why the Sequoia became like this...{nl}But its evil energy looks extremely powerful.{nl}
But that happened a long time ago; now the owl sculptures...{nl}I don't know. Their case looks similar, but why would this happen after such a long time?
Wow... You did a great job!{nl}Now we only need to deal with the Sequoia.
The Sequoia is still lurking around here.{nl}But after the last attack, I don't think we can fight that soon.{nl}
The truth is, we feel sorry for asking you this favor.{nl}The Sequoia is extremely dangerous. We understand if you want to refuse.{nl}
Will you... be okay?{nl}The last place we saw the Sequoia was near the broken path.{nl}
Hm... Right. It's still wounded from the previous attack so...{nl}Someone like you can definitely take it down. I'll wish you good luck!{nl}
If it gets close to you, run away.{nl}We tried ambushing it and even then it was extremely brutal and resilient.
Just try and stay safe...{nl}Do you think you can do it?{nl}
You did it!{nl}You defeated the Sequoia... I am in awe, really.{nl}
We can finally recover in peace now.{nl}Thank you so much for all your help!
Now. We hould check to see if the owl sculptures are still asleep.{nl}Let's split so we can check faster.{nl}
I'll go see the owl sculpture in Siauras Valley.{nl}Please have a look at the Quiet Owl Sculpture at Susipyne Hill.{nl}
Thank you.{nl}Meet me at Siauras Valley again when you're done checking.
Quiet Owl Sculpture
You have divine energy in you.{nl}I heard a girl like you was here a few days ago...{nl}
You want to know about the girl and a suspicious man?{nl}I don't know. I didn't see anything... I just heard about it from the other statues.{nl}
I was worried since they all seemed to have fallen asleep.{nl}Did they see something they shouldn't?{nl}
If Asel is here, that must be why they woke up, right?{nl}Although I'm sorry I can't be of more use to you.
Let's check the statues and meet at Siauras Valley again.{nl}Hopefully with good news.
The sleeping owl sculptures should know?{nl}Hm... I'm sure it was that suspicious man.{nl}
The way he moves is a lot like an assassin.
Fortunately the statue I saw wasn't as affected by the curse.{nl}So I was able to talk to it a little bit.{nl}
It seems the girl was chased by the suspicious man all the way here...{nl}Then she tried to use the power of the owl sculptures to keep him away.{nl}
After that she headed to the Laukimo Vacant Lot.{nl}We should go there too.{nl}
It's tragic... The owl sculptures...{nl}Not even I can help them.{nl}
There's something here. Inside the lot, that is.{nl}But the evil energy is too strong... My body can't take it.{nl}
You don't seem to be affected, though.{nl}It could be the Purifying Sculpture protecting you.{nl}
I think you can go inside the vacant lot.{nl}Please... go and see where this evil energy is coming from.{nl}
Sorry.{nl}I wish I could follow you but I can't move any further...
I can't take it much longer...{nl}Please hurry...
What's this... a dagger and a broken amulet.{nl}I need to have a look at these.{nl}
I'm not sure but I feel traces of a special protection spell on this amulet.{nl}The dagger just gives off a powerful evil energy...{nl}
Right. With this amulet, you wouldn't have to be a demon to use the dagger.{nl}But for some reason the amulet broke... and they abandoned both objects here.{nl}
With an evil energy this strong, I don't think even the Purifying Sculpture can help.{nl}We may need to call Tesla.
I feel so sorry for the owl sculptures inside...{nl}We can only try and stop such a thing from happening again...
Hm... If even Asel can't handle this energy...{nl}There's not much the Purifying Sculpture can do.{nl}
I'll carve another sculpture just in case.{nl}Please wait.{nl}
I don't how much longer I can take it, please hurry...
If the evil energy is too powerful, the Purifying Sculpture alone won't be able to stop it.{nl}
Here. Take this.{nl}It will help the Purifying Sculpture.
Are you saying Tesla created a new sculpture?{nl}Hm... This method is... Clearly I still need to train more...{nl}
Now. The dagger is one thing, but the vacant lot is full of evil energy too.{nl}Go there. Get rid of the evil energy all at once.
I reckon this sculpture will do.{nl}I hope Asel won't be too hard on himself...
Tesla's sculpture is impressive.{nl}I can already feel the evil energy disappear...{nl}
Now. I'll prepare for the dagger purification.{nl}Will you collect the Yellow Griba Pollen?
Thank you.{nl}I'll start the procedure as soon as you come back.
Using the Purifying and Suppressing Sculptures together will work for sure.{nl}This time we'll definitely get to the end of it.
Thank you.{nl}This should be enough.
Okay. I'll start the purification procedure now.{nl}The clash of divine and evil energies is going to attract monsters.{nl}
I'll leave the monsters up to you.{nl}Please take care of them while I finish the procedure.
It's a success!{nl}I've erradicated the evil energy...{nl}
Not everything is back to normal, though.{nl}The owl sculptures are still asleep.{nl}
We also need to find out the one responsible for this...{nl}And the girl.
There is one owl sculpture left.{nl}Its name is Friendly Owl Sculpture... it lives on the Stabdymo Shore.{nl}
I wonder if it knows the whereabouts of the girl or the suspicious man.{nl}
I'm... so sorry.{nl}I really need to rest. Using so much divine force has tired me...
I trust you.
A girl and a suspicious man?{nl}No one's been here in a while.{nl}
Hm... Come to think about it, I did see a pillar of light coming from the lot a few days ago.{nl}I'm not sure if that's related or not.
The statues at the Laukimo Vacant Lot should know...{nl}Why don't you go there?{nl}
Oh... That's why they weren't responding...{nl}Who could have done it...{nl}
We can't let this happen again.{nl}There is a way to look into their memories, at least part of them.
Go and ask Asel to carve another owl sculpture.{nl}I'll impart some of my power onto it.{nl}
That should allow me to peek into the others' memories.{nl}And don't forget to purify any evil energy first.
Looking into the memories of the owl sculptures...{nl}I see. So there is a way!{nl}
I can make a small owl sculpture, no problem.{nl}The purification is going to be a little harder, though...
Here's the statue. Please take it.
The problem is me.{nl}The divine power I used to purify the dagger hasn't recovered yet...{nl}
There's no other way. I'll carve the statue.{nl}Meanwhile, I'm sorry but I'm going to ask you to fill this orb with life force again.
I'm counting on you.
If only I hadn't been attacked by monsters before I met you...{nl}I'm a digrace.
You're back already!{nl}Give me the statue.{nl}
I'll impart some of our power onto it.{nl}After you take it, you'll be able to see some of our memories.
I guess... I'll never see my friends again.{nl}I hopes this at least helps those who survived.
In all my life I had never seen something so mystical.{nl}I wonder what the mysterious power is...{nl}
In the end we still don't know who the two men are.{nl}But considering the power of their evil energy... Someone so strong is surely well-known.{nl}
And thank you for everything.{nl}If it weren't for you, the owls here would be asleep forever without knowing what happened.{nl}
I'm going to investigate this issue a bit further.{nl}May the grace of the goddess bless your way.
The... the broken statues.{nl}They must have been bitten by monsters with evil energy, right?{nl}
I heard the monsters were attacking owls in other forests...{nl}I'm scared that will happen here too.{nl}
Would you clear out some monsters around here?{nl}I know it's not a definitive solution, but it would make me feel safer...
I used to feel safe with all the Dievdirbys around...{nl}Now I'm really worried for the future.
Thank you!{nl}I sure hope you and the Dievdirbys find a solution soon...
I have a favor to ask you.{nl}It seems like the spirits aren't following me anymore.{nl}
It's all because of the Sequoia.{nl}I think the spirits are too scared...{nl}
I need to guide the spirits before the demons get them...{nl}Would you help me with that?
First, collect some Green Sakmoli leaves.{nl}Their scent comforts the hearts of the spirits.
The Sequoia... Maybe the spirits were too afraid of it.{nl}But if they don't return to the goddess, even scarier things will happen...
This should be enough.{nl}Let's try and guide the spirits now.
If you see a wandering spirit, burn the leaves.{nl}Their scent will attract the spirits to you, so you can guide them to me.
Please take good care of the spirits.{nl}Make sure they find their way to me.
Someone once said birth and conclusion are the values remembered in life.{nl}That's why I want to send the spirits to the goddess in safety. Thank you for helping.
When will my friends wake up...?
A lot of people were wounded in the attack and a lot of our things were destroyed, too.{nl}It's a disgrace...
Many souls were startled by the Sequoia and lost their way...{nl}But if they don't return to the goddess, scarier things are going happen...
The sleeping Owl Sculptures should know something.{nl}Asel can wake them up, right?
It's awfully quiet now that most of my friends are asleep...
So. The statue is finished and the orb is ready.{nl}With the power from this orb, purification should be quick.{nl}
Go and take some power from the Friendly Owl Sculpture.{nl}Let's carry on with the purification.
I'm worried. What happened...?{nl}My friends suddenly fell asleep...
It looks like someone is fighting.{nl}What's happening?
Loremaster Daroul
Thank you for helping me!{nl}
Those monsters were more dangerous than I expected...{nl}Lucky you could defeat them so easily, traveler.
Oh, I didn't introduce myself.{nl}My name is Daroul, I'm a loremaster serving Goddess Jurate.{nl}
Maybe... you don't know what we do exactly.
Feel free to ask me anything.{nl}There's probably a lot that you don't know.
Did I satisfy your curiosity?{nl}Unfortunately Goddess Jurate seems to have been mostly forgotten... It's a shame.{nl}
I just wish that Goddess Jurate would answer us for a moment.
We heard the sea had turned into land and came as fast as we could...{nl}We had to prepare everything by ourselves.{nl}
One of our members is looking for a place to build an altar...{nl}Me, I'm preparing an offering for the goddess, but we're very short-handed, you see.{nl}
So please.{nl}Think of this as your destiny chosen by the goddess and give us a hand?{nl}{nl}
Thank you.{nl}First, you could go to the Lamdonas Coral Reef and find some blue corals.
Our other member came while you where collecting the corals.{nl}They found a spot with concentrated sea energy and are going to build the altar there, they said.{nl}
I'm going to go help them; will you come along?{nl}If the ceremony is successful, we might just see Goddess Jurate again.
I feel reassured now.{nl}They said the energy is concentrated at the Dellam Sandbank; come see me there.{nl}
Loremaster Berta
Oh, hello!{nl}You're the one who helped brother Daroul.
These are just what we need!{nl}They're in good condition, too.{nl}
They'll make a wonderful offering for the goddess.{nl}Thank you.
We need the blue corals found at the Lamdonas Coral Reef.{nl}The area has a lot of monsters though, so be careful...
It looks like a normal stone. Let me try the holy water.
We need the altar back as soon as possible...{nl}But the sea energy seems to have made the Crabil even more powerful.
Thank you for helping with our ceremony for Goddess Jurate.{nl}Other loremasters should start gathering here soon.{nl}
I believe that someday Goddess Jurate will once again hear our prayers.
Thanks to you we managed to speed things up.{nl}We should hurry and finish building the altar now.
Our offering ceremony to the goddess was possible all thanks to you.{nl}I don't know what we would do if it were just me and Berta...{nl}
I pray that the goddess will once again look over us soon.
The altar is damaged, and the offerings are completely ruined.{nl}We need to hurry and prepare everything again.
It's hard for me to move because of the wounds...{nl}But I need to have a look at the owl sculptures...
I'll trust you with the coral.{nl}Joana will do a much better job at crafting it than me.
Sigh... Looks like the Ridimeds messed with the dry wood again.{nl}I even threw away all the wood I had stored because of the Sequoia; I don't know what to do...
A lot of people were wounded in the attack and a lot of our things were destroyed, too.{nl}I need to look for my missing knife if things settle.
Thank you for defeating the Crabil.{nl}Thanks to you we can now carry on with the ceremony.
Thank you for finding my knife.{nl}Now I can really focus on my work.
Did you get the handicraft from Joana?{nl}
What a beautiful piece.{nl}Incredible handicraft work...{nl}
Thank you.{nl}I think the goddess will be very pleased with this offering.
A few days ago the Sequoia and the monsters decided to wreak havoc here.{nl}Most of our group fled to a safe place, the rest are here dealing with the damage.
Thanks to you we can focus on getting back on our feet.{nl}We need to get everything ready so the trainees can start practicing again.
Apart from the statue on the Broken Path, no one else is reponding...{nl}What could have happened to the others?
What could have happened to the others...?{nl}And who is that evil man...?
Thank you for helping.{nl}As soon as things settle here we need to take care of those Ridimeds.
Who was that man surrounded by evil energy?{nl}And what could have happened to the girl he was chasing?
It's getting so quiet here.{nl}My friends all fell asleep, one by one...
Exhausted Owl Sculpture
The girl came running to me and I felt an unexplicable warmth in her...{nl}Then the girl used my power to chase away the suspicious man...{nl}
I might have let her borrow too much of my power... I fell asleep right away.{nl}What happened to her?
The forest feels awfully quiet today, now that most of my friends are asleep...
I sure hope nothing like this ever happens again.{nl}I don't want to lose my friends...
Let's go back to Dievdirbys Asel first and talk about this.
Let's look for the statue at the Grubus Highway like the Lonely Owl Sculpture said.
Follow Dievdirbys Asel to the Grynas Hills!
Follow Dievdirbys Asel inside the Laukimo Vacant Lot!
Did you perhaps see any Dievdirbys trainees around here?{nl}I really don't know what...
My friends all seem to have fallen asleep, no one is responding...{nl}It wasn't a monster attack, was it?
The Sequoia was terrifying that night.{nl}All of these unfortunate things keep happening...
I'd never seen anything that frightening.{nl}It was like witnessing another Medzio Diena.
I'm afraid this whole ordeal was really upsetting for everyone.{nl}How can we live in this world anymore...?
I'm glad I at least got my carving knife back.{nl}Us Dievdirbys can do anything as long as we have our carving knives.
They destroy all the tools and the wood, they even attack people.{nl}The Ridimeds, that is.
Now we just need to get things sorted again...{nl}It's going to take a while even with the help of the goddess, though.
The girl... is she alright?{nl}And that man...?
It looks like a regular stone.

I have to go after Sarma who has run towards the Barha Forest.{nl}Even if it's a failed potion, it is still dangerous.
Savior, if you can hear my voice, please, find me..{nl}Nebulas... the revelation... before it is too late.
Someone, here?{nl}You have heard my voice, haven't you?
Then, you truly are a savior.{nl}I have been waiting for you for a long time..{nl}
My name is Zanas.{nl}As you can see, I am a lost soul..{nl}
I have been protecting the revelation of Laima.{nl}In this Kalejimas Prison.{nl}
I don't know how the demons got the info but they invaded.{nl}I will explain in detail.{nl}
But first, we should avoid getting detected by demons. Please, receive protective magic.{nl}Each floor has demon barrier protecting and detecting intruders. Without protective magic, they would know your location.{nl}
There is a magic circle that I have activated while running away from the demons.{nl}Use it to protect yourself from the demon barriers.
Great. There would be one at the interrogation room.{nl}When you get on the magic circle, you will be protected.{nl}
But just one magic circle is not going to last long..{nl}You have to hop to the next one as fast as possible.{nl}
After getting the protective magic, come talk to me again.
The magic circle is designed for living people. A soul like me cannot get the protective magic.{nl}
The protective magic seems to be all working properly.{nl}Now, shall we continue?{nl}
This prison was built by King Kadumel hundreds of years ago.{nl}King Kadumel, always being suspiciouos about other people lived in fear that one day he himself might end up in this place, if insurgency ever succeeds.
So, he has made many secret devices inside this place, in case that ever became reality.{nl}
It can hide something or someone..{nl}Case in point, the devices that have either protective or offensive magic you have just seen.{nl}
It is the secret kept by King Kadumel.{nl}However, my grandfather who worked on the prison maintenance project found them accidentally.{nl}
That is the story I have been raised on... that is why I chose this place.{nl}After becoming the protector of Goddess Laima's revelation, I thought this was a good place to hide it.{nl}
The first step was not a bad one. Getting myself into the prison with a false charge..{nl}And it might have been 4 years ago... I don't know how but Nebulars found this place and rode in with the demons.{nl}
I could not bear to lose the revelation.{nl}If I get captured, I do not know what would happen... that is why I decided to take my own life.{nl}
After my willful demise, I have split my own soul into many parts by using the secret device.{nl}That is the secret behind my survival thus far.{nl}
One small side effect of splitting your own soul into many parts is that your memory gets split as well. So, I cannot find the revelation.{nl}What we can do is to find all of my souls and memories with them and locate the revelation before Nebulars does.{nl}
That is all I can tell for now.{nl}I will do anything to help you find the revelation.
Well, that was a rather long-winded speech.{nl}I am unable to go anywhere because of the demon barrier.{nl}
Especially, I cannot go near the barrier at all.{nl}So, it would be wise for you to get to safety and give me a signal, I will be there.{nl}
As a signalling device, I think Teal Magic Stone would do just perfectly.{nl}It emits a special signal.
Teal Magic Stone can be found on the back of the tombstone in the confessional.{nl}I am not which one it was though.{nl}
Whatever the case, I'm sure it's on the back of the Tombstone so check carefully.{nl}Don't get it confused. It's on the back.
Let's find all the other souls.{nl}At this point, it is virtually impossible for me to help you.
Have you found it?{nl}
It is the right one..{nl}But there is a problem.
The power from Teal Magic Stone is stronger that expected.{nl}It might alert the demons considering its strength.{nl}
We must do something before they are alerted.{nl}I know what we should do! We should cover the stone with demon blood to send a mixed signal.{nl}
If the signal is mixed with that of the demons..{nl}Those who are not familar with Teal Magic Stone like I am will not detect anything suspicious.{nl}
Defeat the demons and acquire their blood.
It doesn't matter which demon as long as it from around here.{nl}You wouldn't have a difficult time locating one, the place is crawling with them.
I am an ordinary man to begin with..{nl}And me being dead, well, is not helping at all.{nl}
It's all my fault, I should have kept it more safely.{nl}
Let's see.{nl}I think it's enough.{nl}
Now, if you need me, use Teal Magic Stone at a safe place.{nl}I cannot get inside dangerous places like barrier.
To dispell a demon barrier, you must destroy Mandara.{nl}It is a powerful demon protecting Kalejimas Visiting Room.{nl}
On top of that, a demon barrier strengthens Mandara.{nl}However, there is a way to deactivate a barrier albeit temporarily.{nl}
Secret device in the isolated area has a Magic Control Scroll hidden inside.{nl}With that, King Kadumel can be defeated.
In order to unlock secret device in the isolated area, you must match the brightness of the lights on both sides..{nl}
The escape plan can only be used by him, no one else. {nl}Now, that is a mark of a true tyrant, always thinking of escape strategies. {nl}
As you can tell by secret devices, what kind of a person King Kadumel was like.{nl}Nota trusting one, I can tell you that much.
Do you have it?{nl}
You are the Revelator selected by the goddess.{nl}You will get the revelation.
The spell that you want to suppress must be inscribed in Magic Control Scroll first.{nl}No ordinary method can do the job..{nl}
The demons have very similar spells among themselves.{nl}So, it doesn't have to be from King Kadumel.{nl}
Defeat the demons and inscribe its spell on the scroll. {nl}It's much safer and wiser than charging straight to King Kadumel.{nl}
Your safety comes first.{nl}For safely delivering the revelation to you is the sole reason why I am staying here instead of the bossoms of the goddess.
The Magic Control Scroll will not completely subdue King Kadumel.{nl}In Kalejimas Prison, there are five demon barriers.
The Magic Control Scroll seems to be ready to go.{nl} All that is left is the downfall of King Kadumel.
Demon barriers are protecting King Kadumel from any harm.{nl}That is why we made the Magic Control Scroll.{nl}
That will suppress the barriers and then you must strike King Kadumel.{nl}However, the Magic Control Scroll will not keep the barriers down completely.{nl}
It will regenerate again and again.{nl}So, you have to use Magic Control Scroll every time it rises up.{nl}
Got it?{nl}Now, let's go and defeat King Kadumel.
King Kadumel is in Offender Institution.{nl}Be careful and keep what I have told you in mind at all time.
King Kadumel was one of Nebulas??minions.{nl}Demon Lord Nebulas is far stronger than King Kadumel.
Are you hurt?{nl}
That's a relief.{nl}Now disabling demon barriers.
To disable demon barrier, you must go down to Supply Room.{nl}The barrier is quite strong and requires something in return. {nl}
The secret device in the supply room has Orb of Dominance Magic.{nl}I believe it is the last card up King Kadumel's sleeve.{nl}
Dominance Magic is a powerful magic, it is enough to dispel demon barrier.{nl}You might face a slight problem but first, let's find the orb.
The secret device in the supply room can only be opened by entering a password.{nl}The problem is the memory about the password, I don't have. {nl}
Perhaps, there might be a part of my soul that remembers the password... {nl}But at the moment, we have no time, we have to solve it ourselves.{nl}
The password is comprised of numbers. {nl}There might be some clues around the device.
I should think about how to use the Orb of Dominance Magic when we acquire it.{nl}It is very powerful. A powerful magic requires something of equal worth in return.
You got the Orb of Dominance Magic.{nl}Nice job. {nl}
Also, I figured out a way to use Orb of Dominance Magic.
I did say something about giving something in return, right?{nl}
Dominance Magic usually needs the user's life force to activate itself. {nl}Quite fitting for the last card in King Kadumel's sleeve.{nl}
But offering the life of Revelator is not an option.{nl}Last of all, all of this is mine own fault. I should have protected the revelation..{nl}
Dominance Magic requires lifeforce or something equivalent or higher. {nl}That is why... I have decided to use my own soul... I will feed Dominance Magic my soul.
If it takes my entire soul, my very existence will cease to be.{nl}However, the soul is something much valuable than the lifeforce, so it will only drain a portion of my soul.{nl}
But, repeat doing that, it will drain my existence completely..{nl}If giving up my existence means saving you, Revelator, I have no regret. {nl}
Don't worry about me, let's just disable that demon barrier.{nl}{nl}
Getting the revelation of Goddess Laima to you, Revelator, is my duty, even after death.{nl}
I have died for the revelation once..{nl}I would do whatever it takes to deliver the revelation to you...
Like I have said before... {nl}When my soul split, so did my memories. At my current state, helping you is a bit difficult. {nl}
We need a part of my soul in Storage facility in Warehouse No. 3.{nl}To find the secret device where my soul resides in, you need two types of spell. {nl}
When King Kadumel was making it, there were two types of magic stones...{nl}Unfortunately, we do not have them at the moment. {nl}
One of them can be solved by your power alone, Revelator..{nl}As for the other one, we should use the power from the monsters. {nl}
They are two completely different powers, it might just solve the secret device.
There is a evil energy core you can get from defeating nearby monsters.{nl}It emits the power exact opposite of your own.
I think the demons have not noticed our movement.{nl}This is our chance!
Hmm, seems sufficient.{nl}I hope, it will work out as planned...
My other soul is hiding in the secret device in Warehouse No. 3.{nl}It cannot get out of it on its own, please turn it off and let it out.{nl}
To turn the secret device off, you have to give two different powers into the machine on each side.{nl}One from your own. The other from the core of the evil energy.
It bears repeating... {nl}Put the power of your own and the power from the monster into each side of the secret device.
I hope my other soul piece has the memory regarding the revelation...
Is it you who got me out? {nl}
Finally, Revelator came.{nl}That means my other soul piece in the visiting room succeeded.{nl}
Some of my soul pieces are captured but it's a relief that one of them at least succeeded.{nl}Revelator is here! Now, the next step can be done.
You need four gems to open the secret device that contains the revelation. {nl}One of the gems is stored in this storage. {nl}
I have no memory of where all the gems are nor the location of the revelation..{nl}Perhaps, my other soul piece would have that information.{nl}
But fortunately, there is an instruction manual for the secret device.{nl}If you find it, we don't have to find the memory to activate the secret device.{nl}
The problem is special spell is needed to read the manual.{nl}For that, we need Teal Magic Stone...
Say what? That's the Teal Magic Stone, right there. {nl}You came prepared, didn't you.
That makes the whole thing, easy-peasy.{nl}The manual is hidden inside a pile of junk in Warehouse No. 2.{nl}
Use the Teal Magic Stone on the pile of junk, there will be a piece of paper levitating.{nl} That's the manual.
If you find the manual, please come straight to the Waiting Room.{nl}I will find my other soul pieces and regain more memories.
Found the manual and some memories have been regained. Now things will get a bit easier. {nl}Now, let's get those jewels.
The King has four jewels.{nl}The red one is inside the secret device in Warehouse No. 1.
In order to open it, you must light three lamps.{nl}Follow the instructions on the manual to light the lamp.
Two of the lamps require specific oil for each lamp...{nl}The rest can be lit with magic.
It ain't exactly Homunculus summoning, just avoid getting devoured by demons and you are good to go.
You lit two of them already? {nl}
You truly are the revelator picked by Goddess Laima.{nl}Now, the last lamp is the trickiest lamp of them all.{nl}
But for you, it won't be that hard.{nl}The last lamp is located at the Kalejimas Visiting Room.
The last lamp will be lit if you activate all the five magic circles surrounding it.{nl}
One activated magic circle will affect the others..{nl}So, you have to think ahead on which one you should activate first.
All these complex machineries... {nl}You cannot deny that King Kadumel was great in that respect. {nl}
Then again, Nebulas has yet to find the revelation thanks to him...
The lamps are all lit. All that is left is King's Red Jewel.{nl}The secret device in Warehouse No. 1 has the King's Red Jewel.
Be safe. {nl}This place is swarming with those demons.
I feel guilty not doing anything while you are doing all the hard work.{nl}I mean, I feel useless because of all those demon barriers.
Now, we are one step closer. {nl}3 more King's gems to go.{nl}
Now, let's disable the demon barrier in the storage.{nl}
I would have to pay a part of my soul as a price but... {nl}I had one piece just now so, I can endure.{nl}
Please, destroy the monsters on your way to the demon barrier. {nl}All our struggles would be in vain if we get captured by the demons.
Get to the barrier and use Teal Magic Stone to call me and I will disable the demon barrier.
Failing my duty is the only thing I truly fear.
We have disable two barriers now.{nl}I bet the demons have noticed something by now.{nl}
We need to interrogate the demons.{nl}It is quite crucial to know how much they know.{nl}
In the hanging room, there is a secret device that seems useful.{nl}There is a magic device that gives out hallucination. Disguise yourself as a monster and let's get the info from them.
The hallucination device in the hanging room uses spell or souls to create its shape.{nl}
So that means to create a hallucination of a demon, {nl}You have to defeat a demon that you want to make a hallucination out of near the hallucination device.
I think the reason why King Kadumel made such device, {nl}is to perhaps fool the enemies and escape himself.{nl}
However, I still do have some questions about how to use the device.{nl}I feel like I am missing something here.
Have you found out something?
They don't suspect that the revelator is here. {nl}If anything, they think I am the intruder. Well, no one is stupid or brave enough to sneak in.{nl}
But Grinender is here... now that is no good news.{nl}We ought to find Grinender's Seal that the demons are talking about.{nl}
It seems that that is what can disable the magic circle created by Grinender.
While you get Grinender's Seal, I will be planning on how to hit Grinender where it hurts.{nl}There must be something.
Some planning is needed for secret devices in the solitary confinement section.{nl}If I am remembering correctly, there were things like teleport scrolls or a magic device...
Did you get Grinender's Seal?{nl}
Good. I also had figured out a plan to get back at those demons.{nl}If it works, we might just easily get through the solitary confinement section.
Here's the plan, get the teleport scroll and get straight to theLong Sentence Prison Cells.{nl}And activate the defense device and exterminate them all.{nl}
The demons in the mid hallway would not know what hit them.{nl}And we walk away like cool guys do. {nl}
The first thing we should do is to get ahold of that scroll.{nl}The Teleport Magic Scroll is inside the secret device located in the Prisoner Waiting Room.
You and I make a great team.{nl}You need a password to open the secret device.{nl}
I believe it was a name of a goddess. {nl}Gabija, Ausrine, Vakarine, Zemyna, Vaivora, Jurate... And you know a lot more, right?
Vaivora, Vakarine, Ausrine, Gabija, Jurate, Zemyna... {nl}It might be enough.
Now that we got the Teleport Magic Scroll and jump ahead to the Long Sentence Prison Cell.
I will hold onto one of these Teleport Magic Scrolls, just in case.{nl}The other one you should use it to get to the Long Sentence Prison Cells.{nl}
When you get to the Long Sentence Prison Cells, turn on the defense device right away.{nl}The instruction is on the manual.
I cannot go because of that Grinender. Once it falls, I will join you as soon as possible.{nl}Godspeed.
The defense device in the long sentence prison cells is intricate with some powerful magic.{nl}I had some explaining to do to the wardens the first time I activate the machine and caused a havoc.
I came here as fast as I could after seeing you defeating Grinender.{nl}It was no easy task, I imagine but well done.
With Grinender no more, the remnants don't stand a chance.{nl}Let's wipe them off so that they won't hinder our quest to find the King's gem.
Don't let your guard down though. {nl}The demons can charge in at any time.
I hope Nebulas also would go down this easily.{nl}But I do have a bad feeling about this.{nl}
I hope this is just a feeling. Nothing more than that...
Remarkable.{nl}Id I had your strength and skills, I would not have taken such a drastic choice..{nl}
There is no point crying over spilt milk... {nl}The present is all that matters, right?
Now let's disable the demon barrier in the Regular Prison Cell.{nl}The King's Green Jewel is inside the the secret device inside the Regular Prison Cells.
Find it that and disable the demon barrier in the Reintegration Workshop.{nl}{nl}
There are six crystals surrounding the secret device.{nl}Breathe spell into them and the device will unlock itself.{nl}
However, the crystals lose their potency after a while.{nl}So, please be hasty.
King Kadumel was never known to show any special talents in using magic. {nl}Probably, he had his mages activate such devices.
The demons surely are showing suspicious signs.{nl}I don't have a good feeling about that...
Darn, a dead end.{nl}They must have noticed us.{nl}
But then again, it is pretty hard to miss the work of art we've left in the solitary confinement area.{nl}Looking at how things are at the moment, we should obtain a different soul piece.
I cannot move further due to demon magic. You are on your own for now.{nl}But fortunately, I can tell you the way to get to the other side.{nl}
A cell in Individual Workshop has teleportation magic. {nl}It is something made by King Kadumel as a contingency plan.{nl}
The magic is activated upon uttering a special sentence.{nl}
I only remember one pass-sentence... {nl}So, you would have to find the cell with the right code.
The magic sentence is
It's not that surprising that it is King Kadumel made the phrase.{nl}
Get to the other side and find Soul Stone of Restrainment from the monsters.{nl}Find the Spirit Stones and free my other spirit.
When you say the correct phrase in the right cell, you will be able to get to the other side.
You have saved me.{nl}Are you perhaps the Revelator?
Just as I have expected.{nl}It is indeed marvelous to see that my other spirits have not failed.{nl}
You have come this far, so perhaps, it is quite safe to assume that you are in fact seeking the King's Jewels. Am I correct in assuming so?{nl}If my memory serves me rightfully, there are two King's Jewels and one of them is hidden inside the Storage.
Alas, the other one has fallen into the hands of Nebulas...{nl}No all is lost, let us take comfort in that and find the yellow one first in the Workshop. {nl}
The King's Yellow Jewel is stored in the secret device located in the Supply Room.{nl}There are four fragments each with unique properties such as Fire, Ice, Electricity and Poison needed to open the secret device.
It originally belonged to me but, I am terribly ashamed to say this, got taken away by the monsters.{nl}It should be around here. We must retrieve it from the monsters.
Curse me for a novie...{nl}I should not have never let Nebulas lay his hand on the King's Blue Jewel...
All the pieces have been brought together. {nl}
Blimey, there is a slight problem.{nl}The pieces have been contaminated by the evil energy from the monsters.
We ought to purify them.{nl}Providentially, there is a way to perform such task.{nl}
The top of the Supply Room, the part where lights are in, there will be Light Crystals.{nl}Shine the pieces with its light. That would purify them.
Doing it once or twice will not be sufficient enough.{nl}You must keep shining the light at them until all the evil energy is casted out.
After the purification process is complete, head down to Supply Room.{nl}Open the secret device there and obtain the yellow gem.{nl}
Place the pieces into the spots around the secret device to open it.{nl}
I am still under Dominance Magic and it's hindering my movement...{nl}As soon as such limitation is removed, I will quickly join you in the Supply Room.
I do not profess to know how Light Crystal is formed.{nl}One could only conjecture that it is a result of collected good aspects of souls fell in this prison...
You've acquired the Yellow Jewel?
What good news.{nl}I am now able to move again.{nl}
There is a secret device in the Punishment Room.{nl}It can be activated by a very strong magic attack.
Once it is activated, we can jolly well blast through the demons and their putrid magic that's standing in our way...{nl}All good things are not that easy to earn as we know by now. I do not have the necessary memory in regards to how to operate it.
My word, you have the manual! {nl}Goddesses be praised! It makes the entire thing much easier.{nl}
Activating the secret device in the Punishment Room will surely deal an overwhelming blow to the demons.{nl}
This strike would definitely leave a mark on their side.{nl}And the magic blocking the way is now go as well.
Righty-O!
There might be some monsters left in Segregated Ward.{nl}The radius of the blast was not that wide.{nl}
We are in this to disable demon barriers... {nl}So, eliminating the remaining monsters is in the job description.
I will reunite with my other spirit.{nl}I will join you right away.
If I can recollect all my separated spirits, I might be able to find a way to...{nl}Defeat Nebulas once and for all.
I can sense something strange.{nl}It is not a pleasant one, I can surely tell you that.
So bizarre... There is a very powerful energy from that direction.{nl}
I believe it is from Nebulas...{nl}Even so, it is far too strong.
This is wrong. Nebulas power should not be that high...{nl}We must find out what happened.{nl}
There is an observational detector nearby.{nl}But... when the demons invaded, the monsters broke it.{nl}
If we could retrieve some parts, we might be able to figure something out.{nl}
The detector is located up on the next floor.{nl}The nearby monsters might have the parts.
What on earth has happened to Nebulas?{nl}He was a strong demon to begin with but this is ludicrous.
Wait, the demon barrier is that strong? {nl}Inconceivable...{nl}
The power emitting from that one is stronger than all the previous four barriers put together.{nl}Perhaps, this is doing of a demon higher than Nebulas...{nl}
Before we disable the barrier, we have no chance against Nebulas.{nl}Now the Dominance Magic will not hold.{nl}
Desperate times call for desperate measures.{nl}I will enhance the Dominance Magic until it's strong enough to disable that barrier.{nl}
It means, I would have to pay my whole soul for it.{nl}For a Stronger Dominance Magic the price paid gets increased aswell.{nl}
It must be done...{nl}If not, Nebulas can never be defeated.
After all, this was caused by my own failure to protect the revelation.{nl}It is my responsibility.{nl}
The cessation of my existence is a small price to pay for delivering the revelation to you, the revelator.{nl}
Defeating Nebulas and getting the revelation...{nl}Saving the world is the task, only you could do.{nl}
Leave the demon barrier up to me.{nl}All you need to focus on is defeating Nebulas and obtaining the revelation.
There is no time to lose. Don't waste your precious seconds worrying about me.{nl}We are racing against the clock.
Use the secret device near the incinerator to enhance the Dominance Magic.{nl}But it requires Energy Crystals first.{nl}
Find Energy Crystals placed on the floor above the Incinerator.{nl}Once enough crystals have been collected, you can activate the secret device.
We must hurry before Nebulas finds us.
I cannot even fathom what functions were intended for the secret device near the incinerator.{nl}I have never heard that King Kadumel was so knowledgeable in magic.{nl}
What good could come out of enhancing such minute spell?{nl}I am not complaining, it did give us the ample opportunity to combat Nebulas thanks to that secret device.
The secret device is operating perfectly.{nl}I will be here enhancing the Dominance Magic.{nl}
As for you, activate all the secret devices in the Interrogation Room.{nl}That would buy us some time.
I have faith in you.{nl}You would not have much difficulty.{nl}
Either activating secret devices to attack demons... {nl}Or destroy demon devices or magic circles. Do whatever you seem fit.{nl}
By the way,{nl}I'd appreciate it if you could deal with some of the monsters on the way so they won't be able to get here.{nl}Give me the signal with the Teal Magic Stone as soon as you get to the Barrier.
It better not be too late.{nl}I really don't wanna fail twice.
Revelation of Kalejimas Prison
I knew well what destiny awaited Zanas...{nl}And I knew he himself was ready to accept it, yet I had no choice but to trust him with the Revelation.{nl}The power that led Zanas, a mere boy, unto the Revelation...{nl}His last breath, his last prayer... were but for your own and our world's salvation.{nl}He shall be remembered for as long as I live.{nl}
I understand this is a sin that cannot be forgiven.{nl}But the lives being lost in our world every day are far too many.{nl}A grave disaster is upon us...{nl}The same disaster that forced us to give up on the petrification curse,{nl}that nearly reduced the kingdom to ruins.{nl}
The goddess that could not be saved will soon be free of her chains.{nl}Past chains of a relinquished salvation crushing Her...{nl}The one taken by the curse of the demon queen shall descend once more as the Goddess of Destruction.{nl}Savior. You must go to the caves holding the hidden goddess captive.{nl}Please... protect her from the demon queen.

Even the care package my brother sent me was "confiscated".{nl}Right. I know you no-life guards took it all for yourselves.{nl}
I'm just saying, the real thief here isn't me.{nl}Wish the guards would just burn this prison cell already.{nl}Please! Oh, Goddess Gabija!
I'm sure they will love to have this letter from their son.{nl}They're his parents, after all...
Researcher Adas
Ugh... The poison is spreading too much...{nl}Who're you? Are you with Sarma?
Is it...? That means Gatre was right.{nl}Sarma released the poison on us and left.
The poison is still spreading... I don't know if we can take it much longer.{nl}We would need the Barha antidote to neutralize it all... please help.{nl}
To make the antidote we need ingredients.{nl}Get me some Barha Herbs first.{nl}
Thank you.{nl}
Gatre did say Sarma looked suspicious...{nl}But who knew this would happen...
You got the Barha herbs.{nl}Looks like we'll be okay with you around.
We also need some Griba juice to make the antidote.{nl}You can get it from Red Big Gribas.{nl}
There's plenty of Big Red Gribas around here, shouldn't be hard to find some.
The Griba juice is the last ingredient we need for the antidote.{nl}We can use the reagent maker to finish the antidote after that, so hurry up.
Sorry to ask this, especially since you're so helpful, but please hurry.{nl}I'm starting to lose my senses...
Oh.{nl}You got the Griba juice too.
We should be able to make the antidote in the reagent maker now.{nl}You need to follow the recipe very carefully.{nl}
You'll see two reagent makers next to the alchemy table.{nl}Process the herbs on the left-side reagent maker, the one with smoke coming out of it, and the Griba juice on the right.
Once you have the ingredients processed, put them in the antidote flask on the alchemy table.{nl}And please hurry... I'm losing my sight now...
The poison is still spreading...{nl}I'm counting on you.
Oh... Thank you.{nl}I'm still a little sore, but the effects of the poison are gone.
Sarma came running and laughing like a crazy person when he released the poison on the researchers.{nl}We couldn't escape and ended up like this.{nl}
Sarma made that poison by accident after failing time after time...{nl}This could have been his plan, for all we know.{nl}
What worries me is that he was headed to where the villagers are.{nl}They all helped in Sarma's research and now they could be in danger. Take the antidote, just in case.{nl}
I'm glad to be alive, but my body still isn't moving right.{nl}If Gatre sent you, you're the only one I can trust.
Researcher Veed
Ugh, who are you?
I hope they're all safe...
Is Gatre...?{nl}
Sarma would have wiped us all if it weren't for Gatre.{nl}Of course, we owe you a lot as well.{nl}
Sarma went south, but he must have sprayed the overgrowth solution all around and now the path is blocked by vines.{nl}We can't get past.{nl}
We can make a neutralizer to reduce these vines, though.{nl}I would do it myself, but it seems my body has its own will at this moment.
If you go to our research room, there's a paper there with the recipes for the neutralizer and other solutions.{nl}Just find that piece of paper.{nl}
Once you find the paper, just follow the instructions to make the neutralizer.{nl}The ingredients will also be written on that paper.
Oh, I still can believe Sarma betrayed us, I'm furious right now.{nl}I would so show him if my body wasn't still in this state.
You managed to make the neutralizer, it seems.{nl}
You can just spray the neutralizer all over the giant vines.{nl} But there's something I want you to do on the way.{nl}
The antidote you have with you is not enough to cure Sarma's poison.{nl}The paper at the research room also has a recipe for an antidote enhancer.{nl}
But Sarma didn't tell us which ingredients he used to make it.{nl}You'll have to look for Sarma's research documents to find out.
Talk to Sireah after you find the materials for the enhancer.{nl}She's the one in charge of making the solutions, she'll know what to do.{nl}
Let's just hope Sarma didn't get to her too.
Sarma... And here I thought he was helping us the whole time...
Researcher Sireah
W-who are you?{nl}
Veed told you to come see me?{nl}I came here to avoid getting contaminated with Sarma's poison.
Veed wants me to enhance the antidote?{nl}
{nl}Okay.{nl}Give me the antidote and the ingredients.
Done.{nl}This antidote should be enough to counteract Sarma's poison.{nl}
Will you clear out the poison from the area that got contaminated?{nl}It's too dangerous right now.
You can use the enhanced antidote to detoxify the area.{nl}Hurry, before the poison spreads any further.
Is the area clean now?{nl}
I'm glad to hear it.
Sarma contaminated the area so we couldn't go after him, then he went north.{nl}He used all of the poison and blocked the way behind him.{nl}
But I think you can get through it with this antidote.{nl}Be careful, though, you never know what he might do next.
I still don't understand what it is that Sarma wants...{nl}Why did he made a fool of all of us.{nl}
All I know is that he's dangerous now.{nl}Please, you have to stop Sarma.
I just hope all the others are safe...{nl}I'm so worried.
You're back.{nl}What happened to Sarma?
Wow... At least he got what he deserved.{nl}It was the goddesses who punished him, I'm telling you.{nl}
Who knows, maybe it was the goddesses who brought you to us too.{nl}Thank you so much for saving us and the villagers.{nl}
If it weren't for you, we...{nl}I don't even want to think about it...
Oh! By the way, Gatre was looking for you just now.{nl}They were worried when they heard you were going after Sarma. Go and see them if you can.
My goodness...{nl}Are you alright?{nl}
Aidas and Veed told me what happened on the way here.{nl}I'm so sorry I got you caught up in a dangerous situation like that.{nl}
But I want to say thank you.{nl}If it weren't for you, we would never be able to save everyone.{nl}
Now we know not to trust people like Sarma and we're going to take care of the village ourselves.{nl}We'll be careful not to let something like this happen again.
Something's happened after Sarma spread the poison around here.{nl}The monsters have changed.{nl}
They're going around spraying the poison everywhere.{nl}At this rate, it won't be long before the villagers are affected.{nl}
We need to stop these monsters before it's too late.{nl}You seem capable enough, won't you help us out?
I knew we could count on you.{nl}You should be able to tell which monsters were affected by the poison, they have a green glow to them.
Sarma really worked some havoc here.
The research Sarma was doing was too dangerous, we can't just leave it be.{nl}I think it would be best to get rid of the equipment.{nl}
Sarma had a main research room where he made the poison.{nl}We'll take care of the other research rooms, meanwhile you can go and destroy the equipment in the main room.{nl}
Sarma had a main research room where he made the poison.{nl}We'll take care of the other research rooms, meanwhile you can go and destroy the equipment in the main room.{nl}
Good.{nl}Everything Sarma was working on must be destroyed.
The research equipment is spread out here and there so it won't be easy getting rid of it all.{nl}And we need to have some antidote saved.
That should do it.{nl}We'll take care of the rest ourselves.
What could possibly have led Sarma to do this...
I can't move my body...{nl}The poison is spreading.
Because of Sarma everything has turned into chaos.{nl}I can't believe this...
We can make it work if we join efforts with the villagers.{nl}We sure learned a lot from this whole ordeal.
I'm still sore but I feel fine.{nl}I'm just glad nothing worse happened to me.
What do we do now?{nl}We really need to think about it.
Thanks to you we managed to avoid the worst.{nl}It's up to us now to solve the rest.
Outsider Mark
I thought I'd be able to fight anything to make my father better...{nl}But now that I'm face-to-face with the monsters, I can't help but be scared.
That elder's prescription is our only hope.{nl}We need those Tini horns to work...
Would... you perhaps be able to help me?{nl}
I came all the way here to get Tini horns.{nl}My father is ill and the shiny Tini horns are supposed to make him better.{nl}
I didn't realise how frightening it was being here... I don't think I can do it on my own.{nl}Would you be so kind to help my father?
Apparently their horns only shine after being pulled out.{nl}Curious, isn't it?
Thank you so much.{nl}I will never forget this favor.
Pilgrim Phylia
I know nowhere is safe anymore after Medzio Diena, but this place seems even worse.
I should be able to get some treatment at the monastery, but I'm worried the wound will become infected before I arrive there.
Help me!{nl}I was attacked by monsters...{nl}
I can't move with these wounds.{nl}Please, traveler, will you help me?
I think I can make it to Maven Abbey with some medicinal herbs.{nl}They're called Taumas herbs... they look a little different from the grass around it. Please bring me some.
The Taumas herbs release a scent when you pick them.{nl}This scent can attract monsters, so please be careful.
Thank you.{nl}Are you also going to Maven Abbey?{nl}May the goddesses hear your prayers then.
I've walked this path so many times, but this time has been by far the roughest.
I hope my buddies at the monastery are okay.
You there.{nl}Can I talk to you for a second?{nl}
You don't seem like a common fellow...{nl}Will you help an old man in trouble?
I'm also on my way to Maven Abbey like the other pilgrims.{nl}But something's different about this path. Because of Medzio Diena, I s'pose...{nl}
I hurt my leg earlier when some monsters attacked me, I even lost my bags.{nl}I had some important things I want to give to my buddies in there...{nl}
So I'm asking you.{nl}If the Tinis don't scare you, please bring me back my bags.
No idea why the Tinis were so interested in my things.{nl}Don't know which one took them either... Some luck, huh.
My bags, you found them!{nl}I can go on with my journey now. Not sure if I can keep walking but...
If you don't mind, I have one more favor to ask.{nl}Can you get me a stick that I can use as a cane?
I'm very sorry, child.{nl}May the grace of the goddesses be with you.
I just need something sturdy enough to take all the way to the monastery.
Now that's sturdy!{nl}Should have no problems getting to the monastery now.{nl}
Ah, but what to do about these monsters...{nl}They're a pain in the neck, I'm telling you.
Are you going to Maven Abbey too?{nl}If you don't mind, would you come with me just half the way?
{nl}No need to go to far, just until the road to Salvia Forest up there.{nl}You know the old building there? That's where I want you to take me.
Do you know this monk?{nl}If something went wrong, they could have escaped. The goddesses' grace must have been with them.
Pilgrim Angela
At last we found someone!{nl}Please, we're trying to help this monk.
What's this?{nl}Why are they lying here?{nl}
What could've happened at the monastery?{nl}Fortunately they're still breathing...
The goddesses are truly looking over us{nl}Certainly finding this monk here was not a coincidence.
We must never lose hope.{nl}And we must never forsake our prayers to the goddesses.
Oh no...{nl}That monk... They look like they've starved for days.{nl}
I will cook them a stew.{nl}Traveler, would you bring me some meat?
The only meat worth eating in this area should be Tini meat.{nl}Please go and gather some.
We should hurry.{nl}They look extremely weak already.
Come back after you've helped my husband.
Thank you.{nl}I will cook this for the monk.
I hope the monk can get their senses back soon, they need to recover.
This is the first time my husband and I do a pilgrimage to Maven Abbey.{nl}If the rumors are true, praying to the goddesses there will make everything better.
Oh my, what was I thinking?{nl}We don't have enough water.{nl}
I saw an old well up north on our way here.{nl}Would you go there with my husband and bring me some water?
My husband will draw the water.{nl}Please look after him and don't let the monsters go near.
Are you ready?{nl}Let's go, then.
The well is up there.{nl}We should hurry.
Thank you.{nl}This will help my wife look after the monk.
Thank you.{nl}Finding you was truly a fortunate thing to happen to this poor monk.{nl}
Could this be anything but the will of the goddess?{nl}We'll have them drink some water first, then the stew.
If this poor fellow if lying here...{nl}Something isn't right at the monastery, don't you think?
Imagine the things they must have gone through, a healthy person like that in this state...
What could've made them be outside of the monastery like this...{nl}In any case, we should take care of them first.
{nl}First things first, fire.{nl}We'll need some if we're going to make some stew or keep warm.{nl}
Traveller. I'm so sorry but...{nl}Can I ask you for some wood for the fire?
Go to the Vabalas Vacant Lot.{nl}You should find some firewood we can use there.
Really wonder what happened to my buddy here...
This should do it.{nl}Let's get started with the fire then. Thanks.
Monk Ethan
Thank you for saving my life.{nl}I'm worried for the monastery, however. I wonder if my brothers are safe...
I was fortunate to find my friend here.{nl}I can't imagine what would have happened should he have gone to the monastery.
Thanks to you and the pilgrims, my friend seems to be better now.{nl}My friend will thank you.
Thank you...{nl}You're the kind people who saved me, is that right?{nl}
I'm Monk Ethan, from Maven Abbey.{nl}Please... You mustn't go to the monastery!{nl}
The abbey was taken by an organization called the Tree of Truth.{nl}They accused me of conspiring with the demons and expelled me.{nl}
As if that weren't enough, they sent one of them to chase after me.{nl}It was a miracle of the goddesses having made it this far...{nl}
Trust my words. You must not go to the monastery.{nl}The Tree of Truth do not worship the goddesses as we do.{nl}
My goodness... Do you mean the monastery was forcefully taken?{nl}The historic Maven Abbey?
{nl}And by that unlawful order calling themselves the Tree of Truth...?
You should speak with my friend now.{nl}Let's see what he has to say.
It's a shame they chose not to listen to my words.{nl}The very same people who saved my life...
Hm... I hope those pilgrims stay safe.{nl}I'm going to stay here with my friend.
Ethan says they're recruiting people to fight the Order.{nl}I'm heading to Klaipeda as soon as I get better.{nl}
The problem is all these monsters blocking the way.{nl}As a last favor, would you clear out some monsters around here?
I'm really sorry for making you work so much.{nl}Just do this one last thing for me.
No, no. It's still too dangerous.{nl}Get some more of those monsters if you can.{nl}{nl}
There's too many monsters on the way to Klaipeda, you see.{nl}I'm asking you. I've no one else I can trust.
You're too kind, I can't thank you enough.{nl}
Not many good people like you left these days.{nl}May the grace of the goddesses be with you always.
Things seemed normal all the way to Taumas Forest, but here it's extremely cold.
I can't see my own breath, but I'm freezing.{nl}This doesn't make any sense. Brrrr...
I was still cold even with all the leather...{nl}But I feel more relaxed now.
Traveller... please help me.{nl}I was on a pilgrimage to Maven Abbey but I can't walk anymore...{nl}
I must be sick... I can't stand the cold...{nl}Would bring me some leather, something to cover myself with...
You should be able to gather some leather from the Red Spions around here...{nl}Please, you need to help me...
I can't stop shivering ever since I arrived in Salvia Forest...{nl}I'm starting to think I might really die here...
Thank you, really.{nl}This leather should keep me from freezing to death...
I'm so cold and hungry...{nl}Not even Medzio Diena was this brutal.
Would you perhaps have something to eat? I'm starving.
I feel full even though I didn't eat.{nl}I only have Clark to thank.
It's funny... I feel so hungry ever since I got here...{nl}I already ate everything I had...{nl}
I'll take anything.{nl}Don't you have anything I could eat?
Can you pick me some berries from Salvia Brambles?{nl}I would be very thankful...
How long is it going to take?{nl}I feel like going to the goddess if I stay like this any longer...
Thank you.{nl}I never felt as cold or hungry as I do now...
I barely made it out of Taumas, but no luck. This place is just as full of monsters{nl}Now I'm not only cold and hungry, I'm too scared too even move.
Killing them is no use, there's always more and more.{nl}Just where are these monsters coming from?
I think I can take on the monsters now that I'm no longer cold or hungry.
I'm so cold and so hungry...{nl}But most of all I'm scared of all the monsters...{nl}
Please.{nl}Could you take care of any monsters around here?
No, there's still too many.{nl}Please, just a little more.
Thank you.{nl}I need to find a way to deal with the hunger and the cold now.
Do not waver before false beliefs.{nl}In this confounding world of ours, we must follow the will of the Divine Tree.
The world knows not how to worship the divine goddesses.{nl}The Tree of Truth can show you the way.
Greetings.{nl}We are the Order of the Tree of Truth.{nl}
We are expelling the false believers...{nl}... and propagating true faith in this monastery.{nl}
We came to protect incoming pilgrims from the monsters.{nl}But it seems a contagious disease has affected the surrounding areas.{nl}
Should you too be interested in true faith...{nl}Won't you help us care for the pilgrims suffering from this disease?
Oh, is that so?{nl}I'll prepare some medicine in that case. You may go with Follower Clark and help the pilgrims in need.{nl}
I'll ask you to watch over Follower Clark while he tends to the pilgrims.{nl}
Many pilgrims are still suffering from this terrible disease.{nl}We ought to hurry and help them.
Please help Follower Clark heal the ailing pilgrims.{nl}Time is running short.
Pilgrim in Treatment
I would be in deep water if it weren't for the followers of the Tree of Truth.
I only need to rest a little longer before I finally head to the monastery.
I don't see Follower Brutus.{nl}He said he would go prepare the medicine, but where is he?
The Order of the Tree of Truth exists to serve humanity by the will of the Divine Tree.{nl}Help those in need and be blessed by the Divine Tree.
Those of us already under the grace of the Tree are safe, but I worry for the pilgrims that have yet to convert.
You might have heard the negative rumors about our Order.{nl}Pure fabrications with no ground on truth. We are merely offering help to those who need it the most.
I can't tell what Follower Brutus is thinking.{nl}I think it would be best to follow him/
But traveler.{nl}Do you not see what's strange?
The ailing pilgrims look very similar to the monsters that inhabit these lands.{nl}I'm talking about... the black energy.{nl}
There's something... strange about it.{nl}There is something I would like to test; would you help me?
Thank you.{nl}This medicine is the same one I gave to the pilgrims...{nl}
Several Red Spions around the area are cursed, surrounded by black energy.{nl}I would like you to apply the medicine on them and see how they react.
It's very strange.{nl}Please, give the medicine to the Red Spions surrounded by dark energy.
The black energy disappears?{nl}Could this mean the medicine is not curing a disease but a curse?
That's... very strange indeed.{nl}It seems Follower Brutus has returned; do speak to him about the reaction of the monsters to the medicine.
A curse, you say?{nl}That's utter nonsense! The condition we're curing is indubitably a disease!{nl}
Furthermore. The medicine we use is made from very precious ingredients.{nl}One does not use such a medicine on monsters like you did!{nl}
Both you and Follower Clark ought to be ashamed!{nl}Thanks to you large amounts of the medicine were wasted.{nl}
Now, I need to make more medicine.{nl}I appreciate your help, but if you have no other business to attend to here, I suggest you leave.
What happened with Follower Brutus?
He sounds furious...{nl}But it's strange. Disease or curse, isn't it worth curing either way?{nl}
This is all very suspicious.{nl}He's never told us what is in the medicine or how it is made, either.{nl}
I ought to find out more about this...
This altar is filled with what are clearly evil demon objects.
Who could have guessed Brutus was a demon...?{nl}We must tell Deimantas about this.
Follower Brutus always makes his medicine alone.{nl}We should follow him.{nl}
Will you come with me?{nl}
I can't believe Brutus was a real demon!{nl}You don't seem like the common folk either, from the way you defeated him.{nl}
This is grave, we have demons hiding among our Order.{nl}You don't suppose our chiefs will know about this...?
I would like to inspect the altar where he performed his ceremonies.{nl}But as you can see, this place is rather dark. I can't see very well.{nl}
I would like to ask.{nl}Would you gather some tree leaves we can use to make a fire?
I'm in shock... wait, I need to think.{nl}I can't believe it... a demon...
You brought the leaves. Thank you.{nl}Light them up so we can see better.
I should be able to have a look now.{nl}Let's see...{nl}
I remember seeing these patterns before.{nl}I believe they were used for placing curses...{nl}
Does this mean the disease was really a curse placed by Brutus?{nl}It would make sense.{nl}
There's no doubt the demons are attempting to slander the order.{nl}They must be the reason behind the rumors.{nl}
This is urgent, I need to return to the monastery immediately and alert the High Officers.{nl}Please tend to the other pilgrims meanwhile.{nl}
Traveller. Did Follower Clark really leave?{nl}Myself and the other pilgrims haven't recovered, I don't think we can continue our journey just yet.
{nl}We're worried about the monsters in this area.
There's too monsters around for us to be safe.{nl}Did Follower Clark return yet?
Follower Clark is late. What could have happened to him?{nl}Traveller. I'll ask you for one more favor.
Thank you.{nl}I'll do my best to recover.
Thank you.{nl}There still seems to be quite a lot of them around... but it's a little better than before.
It feels a lot safer than before.{nl}We'll try to recover now, so we can carry on with our pilgrimage. Thank you.
Pilgrim Vados
We too are servants of the goddesses.{nl}We cannot ignore the murder of our clerics.
Surely wise monks of Maven Abbey will give this soul a rightful judgment.
I have no reasons to doubt the monk.{nl}It's the demons who ought to be punished.
The Tree of Truth you describe sounds very different from what I heard.{nl}They could very well be conspiring with the demons.
You ask why this monk is tied?{nl}We don't know if this person really is a monk, but in any case that does not concern you, does it?
Are you really that curious?{nl}Alright... Since you aksed, then.{nl}
We're pilgrims coming from Grynas Trails.{nl}We arrived here and, what do you know, we start to hear someone screaming!{nl}
This is who we found when we followed the sound.{nl}The one dressed in monk garments was passed out on the ground.{nl}
Isn't it obvious? This person murdered a monk.{nl}Would you not tie up a person suspected of murdering a cleric?{nl}
We want to bring this person to the monastery and let them be judged there.{nl}The folk at the abbey will know what to do.
These people are misunderstanding me.{nl}I have no reasons to hurt one of the brothers.{nl}
I was the one who screamed!{nl}I'm a monk at Maven Abbey...{nl}
The monastery is in chaos because of the Tree of Truth.{nl}So I escaped with my brother and we ended up in this area.{nl}
And yet... My mistake was leaving my tired brother behind for a moment...{nl}I screamed when I returned to find them dead already...{nl}
That's when these people arrived and took me for the criminal.{nl}Please, help me. I'm innocent, I swear!{nl}
Well, you can listen to what this shameless criminal has to say if you want.{nl}But it will all be lies.
Please believe me!{nl}I did not hurt one of my brothers!
These people are seriously misunderstanding the situation.{nl}Please help me clear things out.
I'm glad we clarified the situation.{nl}But the fact remains that something horrible happened.
I'm worried for the safety of the other monks.
We have reasons to believe this person is the culprit.{nl}Try and convince the other pilgrims if you believe otherwise.{nl}
If you can't prove that this person is innocent...{nl}We have no choice but to leave their faith up to the monastery.
Do as you wish.{nl}The pilgrims over there know what they saw.
I and the others all believe that person is a criminal.{nl}They claim to be innocent... but what would you expect a criminal to say?
Revelator, please.{nl}Help me prove my innocence.
W-what? Now that's...{nl}Hm, I stil don't think...{nl}
Alright, alright. I guess I was wrong.{nl}I apologize for being suspicious...
I'm really sorry.{nl}It's the demons and the Tree of Truth who are wrong. We almost punished the wrong person.
Pilgrim David
We had no choice but to assume he was the culprit.{nl}I believe Vados made the right decision.
All circumstances point to him being the criminal, it's all very clear.
I feel extremely sorry for the monk.{nl}If only we had believe them this whole ordeal would never have been.
It isn't right to suspect people at will, I understand that now.
I don't think that person is a real monk.{nl}He could just be pretending, couldn't he?
{nl}If he was really a monk, would he have a way to prove it?
Then show us proof that this person is really a monk.
They want proof... I suppose reciting the scriptures won't be enough.
{nl}I do have a rosary made at our monastery, however.{nl}It has my name engraved on it too.
{nl}I dropped the rosary when I was caught by the pilgrims.{nl}It should be near my luggage, at the Deveera Forest Road. Please find it.
{nl}If I show them the rosary, it will prove to them that I am a monk.
As expected, no proof that this person is a monk so far.
You say this is his rosary?{nl}It's true, it has the name Dorma engraved in it.
{nl}It really looks like he's a monk.{nl}But why would he harm another monk?
Pilgrim Eli
Dares to impersonate a monk on top of that harming a monk? {nl}There is no need to go to the abbey. Let's go get him straight to Klaipeda.
All circumstances point to being guilty but still maintaining innocence.
A man can err. {nl}I am just glad all misunderstanding have been solved.
I have been told that the Order of the Tree of Truth was a trusty organization showing the people a new way. {nl}But they were working with the demons all along. That is why you cannot trust heresays.
I was the first founder of that person and the body together.{nl}I still believe that person is the perpetrator.{nl}
I even saw a bloody knife on his hand.{nl}A body and a man with a knife, what more solid evidence could you possibly want?
Let's what kind ingenious excuses he is going to spout.
I am innocent!{nl}I was merely examining the knife stuck inside my colleague.
{nl}The demons that were following had a similar weapon...{nl}My colleague was struck by demons!
There is one way to prove my innocence.{nl}Proving that the knife is indeed from demons.
Please, find my luggage at Deveera Forest Road. In it, you will get Holy Water.{nl}Get that Holy Water to Vados and ask him to pour it on the knife.
My luggage is located at the upper side of Deveera Forest Road. Please, find the Holy Water inside my luggage
This is the Holy Water that was in his luggage? {nl}Then, can we test if this is indeed a genuine article.
Yes, that is a real one.{nl}Please, hand it to him.
Let us test the authenticity of the Holy Water.{nl}Please, sprinkle it on nearby Yellow Dumaros and observe their reactions.
Sprinkle the Holy Water on Yellow Dumaros and see the results.
As you wish, Vados.{nl}Those demons will surely show the effect.
I am yet to be convinced whether this is real Holy Water or not.
Hmm... the demons did react in an expected manner, right?{nl}Then now let us test his claim.
Now, we will pour Holy Water unto the weapon this man was holding to see if this is a demonic weapon or not.
{nl}But be warned, even if the weapon reacts, that would not be the end of it.{nl}He might be a demon himself and his current appearance might be just a disguise.
{nl}We would have to make him drink it as well.
Uh, at least you are a monk.{nl}Please, pardon my previous insolence. That means this is a demon's doing after all?
Now, all the suspicions Eli had have been resolved.{nl}But not all suspicions on him have been resolved yet.
Pilgrim George
Monks usually do not venture outside the abbey.{nl}My suspicion is that why would you come to this place that is far away from the abbey.
Mere coincidences are not enough to explain the circumstances. Especially when the suspicion fits the circumstance so perfectly. {nl}I am still yet to be convinced of his innocence.
I was terribly mistaken.{nl}I should properly apologize to the monk.
The circumstances be. It is for the best to figure out a way to get safely back with the monk.
If I may speak of my suspicion.
{nl}Why would two monks travel to such a remote place.{nl}And at the time of the actual murder, why was he absent?
{nl}I cannot help but to doubt his innocence.{nl}Why were they here and where was he at the time of the murder.
Our abbey is in great peril.
{nl}The Order of the Tree of Truth has came and is currently occupying the abbey.{nl}Furthermore, they forced us to be converted.
{nl}Of course, we escaped to get help from outside.{nl}But then, the demons started to chase after us.
{nl}We barely escaped to this Sekta Forest. The escape was so sudden and harsh one and it took its toll on my brethren. He collapsed from hunger and thirst.{nl}That is why I was away; looking for something to eat and drink.
{nl}I hope this sufficiently my story.{nl}Please, pass it on to him.
To prove a monk's innocence, I request answers to my questions...
I see. {nl}But words are not enough.{nl}I want to see something solid.
That's all I can say.{nl}I am not sure whether he would believe it or not.
Solid evidence? {nl}I don't know what to do.
{nl}Well, I did gather some plant roots as something to eat. {nl}While gathering, I did throw out the bad ones...
{nl}Would that be enough?
I am grateful for doing this for me.{nl}The location where I threw them away was Gingkaras Reed Field. Please search them in that vicinity.
On Gingkaras Reed Field, there would be plant roots that it seemed unfit to eat.
Were there any evidences to prove his alibi?
Quite partially rotten. Very unfit to eat, indeed. But they do seem freshly dugged out.
{nl}I am convinced. I now believe what the monk had claimed.{nl}I should apologize to him properly.
Yes, those are the rotten plant roots that I threw out.{nl}Please, prove my innocence.
We have been chased by the demons. {nl}But a strange thing was that they seemed to be intending to capture us rather than kill us.{nl}
They must have changed their attitude.{nl}Does this mean, they no longer see the need to convert us? {nl}
I am only alive because I was away at the time. {nl}If I was with him, the same fate would have hit me as well.
If what the monk has been telling is true. All the other monks are... {nl}We should eliminate the demons that are targeting the monks.
I have already forgotten and forgiven what happened.{nl}Forgiveness is the main virtue of a clergyman, after all.{nl}
Anwyay, Vados seems to have something to speak to you about.{nl}{nl}
I have a cunning plan.{nl}If the demons are still looking for the Monk, we could trap them.{nl}
Please, take the monk to Mova Wilderness.{nl}The demons, unaware of your true feats, will decide to attack.{nl}
Your power would be more than enough to teach them who is the boss. {nl}We are counting on you!
Vados seems to be thinking about something.
I knew you would help.{nl}As soon as you are ready, get going with the monk.
I have heard from Vados about the plan.{nl}When you are ready, shall we?
As soon as they show their ugly heads in Mova Wilderness, strike them down at once.
Good work.{nl}We have been thinking. We will follow the monk's advice.{nl}
The pilgrimage ends here and we will get back to Klaipeda.{nl}You should get to safety as well.
Thanks to you, Revelator, all the troubles and toils I was in have been resolved.{nl}I cannot thank you enough for this. The goddess shall present you with the appropriate grace to you.
You've eliminated all the demons that were after the monk? Impressive to say the least.
The name 'Revelator' is not in vain, I suppose.{nl}Getting rid of the demons assassins just like that.
I have heard that you have defeated the demons that were after the monk.{nl}It must have been hard work.
I came to realize that you are a great person. Seeing how much you have done to prove the monk's innocence {nl}Well, if it is not too much to ask, I have a favor to ask of you, would that be alright with you?
Well, our way back is filled with monsters now. {nl}Vados says we can avoid them but I am worried.{nl}
Could you defeat nearby monsters?
I cannot deny that it is quite disappointing. We have come this far. {nl}However, nothing is more valuable to life, right?
Thank you so much.{nl}Goddess is looking after you.
That's not good.{nl}Looking at our stock, our food supply is sure to run out on the way back.{nl}
I am so ashamed to ask you this but... there is no other way.{nl}Could you get us some Lepusbunny Meat to replenish our food supply?
I really appreciate your help.{nl}We only planned and stocked for the trip to the abbey...
Demon Meat is unsuitable for consumption.{nl}The only option is meat from nearby Lepusbunny.
I think we have enough for all of us. {nl}My heart is filled with gratitude.
The teachings of the goddesses is based on mercy. {nl}If there is an exception, that would apply to the demons.{nl}
Not only took my brethren's life but tried to harm me as well.{nl}This wrath I feel... I think even the goddesses would forgive me on this.{nl}
I beseech you.{nl}Please, show those demons the retribution.
Thank you. {nl}The nearby demons are Yellow Dumaros.{nl}
They seem like mere beasts but they are demons after all. So, please be vigilant. {nl}
Thank you. {nl}I am eternally in your debt.{nl}
Thank you.{nl}I thought I was going to get captured.{nl}
I am a librarian from Maven the Great Abbey.{nl}But now the Great Abbey is occupied by the Order of the Tree of Truth...{nl}
We had to ask the help from Klaipeda in order to save the abbey.{nl}If the Revelators were there, things would have been different.{nl}
Please.{nl}Escort me to Klaipeda.
My words... you are the Revelator? {nl}O, the goddesses have not forsaken me! {nl}
I beseech thee.{nl}Save our abbey...
Please, Revelator.{nl}Even as we speak our brethrens and sistrens are suffering. Help us.
Why would they want to occupy the abbey even going as far as framing us. I cannot even begin to fathom their reason{nl}They do worship the goddesses just like us. Why so hostile?
Well, I believe it was a week ago.{nl}The Order of the Tree of Truth started to gather in front the abbey.{nl}
They claimed we have been working alongside the demons. Such false accusation! {nl}Of course, we denied such ridiculous claim but they didn't listen...{nl}
A female believer from the Order claimed that she can prove our allegiance with the demons.{nl}From the looks of her, she must hold an important position in the Order.{nl}
She casted an incantation...{nl}And one of our brethrens turned into a demons. {nl}
That must have be a visual trickery. {nl}The brethren was born in the abbey and have been raised there his entire life.{nl}
The reaction from the Order Believers when they saw it was explosive.{nl}Within just few minutes, they began to drive us out.{nl}
Many of my monk brothers and sisters have ran away or have been captured.{nl}
Only a handful of brethrens including me managed to escape... {nl}I am deathly worried about all of them. I have no way knowing what happened to the others.{nl}
I know it is a vain struggle but... {nl}I did attempt to rescue the captured brethrens.{nl}
The gate of the Abbey was shut tight. There was no way in.{nl}
All I have left to trust is you Revelator.{nl}Please, save our brethrens and... the abbey.
By the looks of it, mosts ofthe Believers are being duped by the higher ups...{nl}I believe they are innocent.{nl}
There are 3 high-ranked officers in that Order.{nl}If we can expose their true motives, the Believers will see the truth about us as well.{nl}
I believe they are in the abbey...{nl}A man called Domantas lead the Believers to this place.{nl}
They seemed to be looking for a way to lure pilgrims to the abbey in...{nl}First, we capture Domantas and figure out our way in the Abbey.
They accused us of being demons... {nl}But I sensed the demon in them.{nl}
There must be demons among them. {nl}The officers and executives, most likely.{nl}
If we can expose the true identity of Domantas, people will listen.{nl}I have something to test out. Could you help me on that?
A long time ago, there was a holy monk famous for defeating demons.{nl}He died a martyr fighting demons.{nl}
We never recovered the body but we placed the keepsake and made a grave.{nl}Among them, there are two devices that can determine a demon.{nl}
One of them is an orb that only attacks demons...{nl}The other is a mirror that shows the true self.{nl}
Having at least one of them can show their true faces.{nl}
It is very blasphemous but... {nl}At this time, there is no other way.{nl}
The monk's grave is one of the four grave in Ketra Cemetry.{nl}Please, retrieve the keepsake that I have told you about.
The orb is broken... {nl}But fortunately, the mirror seems fully intact.
According to the records, the mirror exposes the target's true identity.{nl}But it has been underground for so long, there is little juice left.{nl}
Could you help me recharge the mirror?
Let's try the lifeforce from nearby monsters.{nl}The mirror will automatically absorb the monster's lifeforce, when it falls.{nl}
This is our only opportunity, please, fill it up with power.
Thank heavens! The mirror is full of juice now.{nl}The only thing left to do is to lure Domantas.
Tired Pilgrim
The people from the Order what they say is enticing but...{nl}Why can't we enter the abbey...
The Order is right! Always! {nl}If it weren't for them, we would have been supper for monsters...
Leaving the holy object like that is wrong for the Order...{nl}The least we could do is to build a shrine and pray to it...
Is there any meaning to Maven Abbey?{nl}This place is a true holy place for goddeses who visit us every night...
High Officer Domantas or one of the subordinates must be a demon in disguise.{nl}The problem is they don't stay in one place for long..{nl}
We need to lure Domantas in.{nl}Perhaps, the Pilgrim Camp down there...{nl}
I have seen Domantas and the believers of the Order preaching to the pilgrims.{nl}Let's go to the camp and figure out the way to lure Domantas in.
Thank you. {nl}The nearby monsters are quite hostile so we'd better be careful.
Urgh, strangely, I feel very tired and worn out.{nl}Could this be the doings of the Order?
That's bizarre... {nl}The moment we got here, I feel light-headed and cannot think straight...
I am weakened now... but I must protect the abbey...
Could you look into this phenomenon? My body is not ready nor responding well {nl}How about you, Revelator? {nl}
Perhaps, could you ask pilgrims around to see what is going on?
Thank you...{nl}Please, listen to the people here.
My body is getting heavier by the minute.{nl}What is going on...
It's becoming more difficult to think... I can feel it...{nl}Alright, let's summarize...{nl}
The black crystal in the shrine erected in Shinikti Vacant Lot is said to be casting out monsters.{nl}The Order of the Tree of Truth claimed that this is a holy object and the drowsiness one feels is the blessings from the Tree.{nl}
And by every night, it turns to the goddess?{nl}I'm getting curious.
The black crystal is very valuable to the Order. {nl}If we break it, Domantas is sure to come.{nl}
Please.{nl}Destroy the black crystal...
If you think about it, leaving such an important artifact undefended must mean, it is hard to destroy.{nl}If it is demon-made, surely the divine power can break it.{nl}
Please, take my rosary.{nl}Its divine power will weaken the crystal. If so, it will become breakable.
Please, place my rosary in front of the black crystal and destroy the crystal.
Thank you, I feel much better.{nl}Just as I expected, the believers of the Order will come out to check.
The true face of the Order is slowly getting revealed.{nl}The truth shall soon be known.
What was that black crystal?
The campside is quite noisy.{nl}They must be coming.
{nl}I will expose the demon with the mirror. I leave the rest up to you.
Revelator, you are amazing!{nl}
Since Domantas is a demon, it is most likely that the other officers are demons too.{nl}Especially, Deimantas the one who leads.{nl}
Now, we'd better prepare to get inside the abbey...{nl}I don't have the key. {nl}
We must find the one who handles the keys of the abbey.{nl}He ran in direction of Oasseu Memorial. Better find him there.{nl}
I'll meet you there.{nl}Please come to the Oasseu Memorial.
Even this place was taken by the Order and Demons.{nl}What do you think they were trying to do here?
There is a legend stating that the Oasseu Tree had been planted by Maven.{nl}Maybe that's why the Oasseu Tree didn't harm people even on Medzio Diena.
You're here.{nl}I couldn't find the Brother... who managed the keys.{nl}
I'm worried that he's been taken by the demons.{nl}There... there is also a strange feeling about this place.{nl}
This is a place where the holiest have been buried.{nl}That's why it was always filled with divine power... But I can't feel any of it now.{nl}
I think that we'll need to find out what happened.{nl}Then we can go look for the Brother.{nl}
Thank you.{nl}Please check to see if there is anything amiss at the Hermit's Tomb.
What happened...{nl}I can't even imagine what they were after.
A strange device is emitting a dark energy?{nl}I see... The Order must be suppressing the divine power with that device.
I don't know what the Order of the Tree of Truth is after...{nl}But I suspect that this place has also been taken over by the Order,{nl} and the Brother must have been taken by them as well.{nl}
Let's lure them out as we did before.{nl}I'm sure the Order will appear if we destroy their devices.
If we think about the Black Crystal at Rasvoy Lake...{nl}I think the divine power will be enough.{nl}
Take this bottle and go to the Oasseu Tree.{nl}It grew under the influence of the divine power for a long time.{nl}
Spray the Order's Device with the Tree's Sap.
Please get some of the Oasseu Tree's Sap and spray it on the Divine Power Suppression Devices.
Have you destroyed the Device?{nl}I can feel the divine power returning to this region...{nl} I don't think the Order has noticed yet.{nl}
Let's keep trying.{nl}There must be another device since the divine power hasn't fully returned.
This is the abbey's land and in turn the Order's land as the abbey is now under our influence.{nl}Please do not disturb us.
People cannot endure times like these with contemporary beliefs.{nl}Yes... Maybe the goddesses wanted you to follow the Order.
The next place where a device might be...{nl}It will probably be near the tomb at Rijekavi Fields.{nl}
I hope I am right...{nl}Could you please destroy another Device to try and lure the people from the Order?
The plan is the same as before.{nl}Gather Sap from the Oasseu Tree and spray it on the Device.
I hope we will be able to find the Brother this time...
Halt! Was it you?{nl}Are you the one that has been destroying the Order's Holy Devices?{nl}
I don't know what you are up to, but you had better stop.{nl}This is the holy ground of Maven Abbey!{nl}
Please do not handle the devices if you are not from the abbey or the Order.{nl}
Wait... Did you just say Stella?{nl}I don't know where you heard that name, but she can't be alive.{nl}
I saw her being chased by Demons with my own two eyes!{nl}Do not dare to defile the name of the deceased.
I don't know who the imposter is, but she cannot be alive.{nl}I wish to see for myself.{nl}
Take me to this person who you call Stella.{nl}You cannot touch the device before that.
I am sad to hear that we have lost the Brother...{nl} But we have someone within the Order that can help us.{nl}We have to hurry if it is only for the Brother who is now back with the goddesses.
Thank you.{nl}I will pray that you will be well rewarded for this.
Don't you think that you should learn more about the Order instead of simply being hostile towards it?
Those Devices must all be destroyed.{nl}If only for the Brother who is no longer with us...{nl}
I cannot forgive the Order.{nl}Please return to Rijekavi Fields once more.{nl}
You already know the location, correct?{nl}Good luck.
How could they do this?{nl}The Order... How...
Good job.{nl}Things seem to be going extremely well.{nl}
Come to think of it...{nl}I think it would be better if we do not destroy any more of the devices.
That's strange...{nl}I can't seem to find High Officer Medea anywhere.
Are you sure you will be okay on your own?{nl}Don't you think we'll need more help to retake the abbey?
I will watch Medea so that she can't go anywhere.{nl}She won't be able to escape the magic circle as long as she's human.
Revelator, I leave the fate of the abbey in your hands.
Re... Revelator...{nl}She... has escaped... Ugh...
Ah... That is correct. {nl}Of course you could also stop their plans by destroying the device.{nl}
But don't you think that it is a bit wasteful to do so?{nl}
At times like these... It is sometimes better to use their powers against them.{nl}With these magic scrolls.{nl}
This Scroll allows you to transfrom all energies into divine power.{nl}You will be able to use this scroll to make the Divine Power Suppression Device release large amount of divine power.{nl}
You will help me of course... won't you?{nl}
I was certain that you would help me.{nl}
What are you doing?{nl}Hurry to Krasjia Hill.{nl}
Ah, Revelator.{nl}I can't seem to find Medea anywhere.{nl}
By the way, how many devices have you destroyed?{nl}
What? {nl}Stella gave you those Scrolls to use on the device?{nl}
That's odd.{nl}Of course Stella is the abbey's librarian so she would know Scrolls that I don't know about but..{nl}
I haven't heard anything about such Scrolls.{nl}I'm suspicious but... She should know better...{nl}
However, I think you should take some Oasseu Tree Sap just in case.{nl}Just in case.
Have you still not started on your journey?{nl}You have to hurry to stop the Order's scheme.
I hope I'm worrying about nothing but..{nl}Remember to take the Oasseu Tree Sap just in case.
I don't have anything else.{nl}I surrender.
{nl}The only ability I have is to show illusions you know.{nl}I'll tell you anything you want so please go easy on me.
Impressive. Now what are you going to do to me?
What do you think I'll be able to do in this situation?{nl}Relax.
Is this how you learned to treat the defenseless? How rude.
Restraints, a Magic Circle and a guard..?{nl}You don't have to fear me so much you know.
Wait a second. {nl}Please don't think I'm on the same level as Deimantas.{nl}
I am a human. {nl}You won't hurt another human would you now?{nl}
I'll tell you where Stella is as well as hand over the Abbey key if you let me go.
Is there someone else that will guard me?{nl}
Fine, whatever.{nl}Then let's go meet him then.
I never imagined that you'd capture Medea. {nl}You are more capable than I had thought.{nl}
I'll restrain her so she won't be able to run away.
Medea! What did you do to Stella?{nl}If anything has happened to her, I don't know what I'll do!
Let's see...{nl}All I did was to have her captured and taken to the vacent lot left of Stjeva Intersection.{nl}
How would I know if something has happened to her since then?
Are you sure you can trust this guard?{nl}I don't know. I don't trust him too much but... Fine, have it your way.
Revelator! {nl} Stella seems to be held near Stjeva Intersection.{nl}Please save her! I'll stand guard here to make sure that nothing happens!
Please!{nl}I'll be watching Medea.
Stella might be suffering a great deal even at this moment!{nl}Please hurry!
I don't know what the demon might be doing to her.{nl}You might want to hurry you know?
Thank you, Revelator...{nl}I don't know how many times you've saved my life...{nl}
After you went to Rijekavi Fields, I suddenly couldn't see anything...{nl}When I woke up, I had already been captured...{nl}
We don't have time for this. We have to go and retake the abbey!{nl}I'll see you at the base of the Oasseu Tree!
Now that you have the key, all that is left is to take care of Medea before going to the abbey.
I thought all of the Order's high officers were demons after seeing Domantas...{nl}I never thought that there would be people that had volunteered to help the demon.
Now we have to retake the abbey.{nl}Medea will manage to escape if we just leave her like this.{nl}
I just thought of a good idea.{nl}I'm thinking of creating a Restrainment Magic Circle with the remaining power of the Divine Power Suppression Device Fragments.{nl}
If I use the power remaining in the fragments... {nl}I'm sure we'll be able to hold Medea until we retake the abbey.
Thank you so much.{nl}I don't know what would have happened if I had not met you...
The Divine Power Suppression Device was at the Hermit's Tomb, Rijekavi Fields and Krasjia Hill.{nl}Please get two fragments from each place.
Please help me prepare to activate the magic circle.
She first asks you to destroy them and now she wants you to gather their Fragments.{nl}Isn't she being to demanding just because you're a Revelator?
{nl}You won't have to do anything of the sort if you help me out.
The preparations are complete. Go and tell Sister Stella that the magic circle is ready to be activated.
Remote Tombstone
Maven prophesized that this road will always be threatened by the demons.{nl}I now go to rest after completing my mission but am worried about who will now stop the Demon threat.{nl}
If someone honorable happens to pass and defeat the demons{nl}they will have my enternal thanks even if I had returned to the goddesses.
A warm light emits from the tomb as if to give a blessing.
After talking to Brother Mattas, it seems as if the abbey is in more trouble than I had thought.{nl}There are even demons and monsters roaming around inside.{nl}
Please deal with the monsters in front of the abbey.{nl}I'll wait for the chance to open the doors.
I won't be able to open the doors until there are less monsters.{nl}Good luck.
I was able to hear some information from Medea.{nl}It seems as if High Officer Deimantas is at the Hall of Honor.{nl}
It seems like they have raised a Barrier and are defiling the Divine Power of the abbey to use as their own.{nl}Of course, we can't believe Medea's word at face value, so we'll have to check for ourselves.
We won't be able to stop High Officer Deimantas if we don't break this barrier.
We also have to save the others that have been captured... I keep getting nervous.
We'll have to see what type of barrier it is first.{nl}Could you please get me to the Barrier?
Shall we?{nl}Please be careful of the monsters.
Ah... It seems like Medea was telling the truth afterall.{nl}We'll have to find a way to get through here in order to stop Deimantas.
I remember seeing a Ancient Book about Demon Barriers.{nl}Could you please protect me while a look for it?
I found it!{nl}But... I'll need some time while I look for where the information about this particular barrier is.
I'll try to find it as fast as I can, but please keep the Demons off of me one more time.{nl}I'm counting on you!
It took longer than I thought because the information was in the latter half of the book.{nl}All we have left is to get rid of this barrier.
First, we need something to hold the divine power.{nl}Could you get an Orb from beneath the Stoup while I finish the spell?
I'll be completing the spell here as is mentioned in the book.{nl}May the goddesses bless you.
Just a second... This is an extremely complicated spell...
Yes. This orb should do nicely.{nl}The spell is just about ready as well.
Now we have to gather the divine power in this orb.{nl}
Maybe the Central Fountain... {nl}There may be some divine power there even if Deimantas is trying to use all of the divine power in the abbey.{nl}
Of course I'll do the gathering.{nl}Just take me to the Central Fountain in once piece.
They have become too weak to even wimper.{nl}We need to help them recover their strength.
The only reason I was able to save them is thanks to you Revelator.{nl}Thank you so much.
It's finished!{nl}Now let's go and find Deimantas!{nl}
Are you ready?
Finally... The abbey has been retaken from the grasp of the Order of the Tree of Truth.{nl}This was all possible thanks to you!{nl}
I saw the barrier on the upper rooms disappear as soon as Deimantas was defeated.{nl}I went there because I suspected that there may be some of my captured colleagues and there they were..{nl}
I'm worried because their condition is far weaker than I thought.
My goodness... I shudder to think what they must have gone through.{nl}We have to get something for them to eat.{nl}
I think Stew would be best since they haven't had anything for a while.{nl}Please look for anything edible left in the pantry.
Please hurry back.{nl}I'll be getting the water ready.
The Order of the Tree of Truth wouldn't have use or tossed all of the food in the abbey.{nl}Especially not if they were thinking of using this place as their headquarters.
Thank you!{nl}I'll get the Stew ready.
Could you please get some medicine while I get the Stew ready?{nl}There should still be some herbs in the corner of the Lower Prayer Room stashed away for emergencies.
All three of the lower rooms were used as Prayer Rooms.{nl}At least they used to...
Thank you.{nl}I see there were still some usable herbs.
We wouldn't have been able to drive off the Order of the Tree of Truth without you.{nl}Even if Klaipeda had managed to send some soldiers to help.{nl}
There are still too many Demons left in the Abbey.{nl}My colleagues... I know I have been asking for a lot of help, but could you please deal with the Demon stragglers?
Thank you.{nl}Please get rid of as many Demons as you can in the Abbey.
They are all too weak.{nl}It will be a massacre if the Demons decide to attack at once.
Thank you so much.{nl}I'll be praying that the Demons don't decide to attack at once until my colleagues have recovered.

I knew well what destiny awaited Zanas...{nl}And I knew he himself was ready to accept it,{nl} yet I had no choice but to trust him with the Revelation.{nl}The power that led Zanas, a mere boy, unto the Revelation...{nl}His last breath, his last prayer... were but for your own and our world's salvation.{nl}He shall be remembered for as long as I live.{nl}
We were determined to refuse when the demons offered to give us supplies in exchange for killing the Revelator, but when they threatened to kill us instead if we didn't do it, we had no choice but to obey.
I am planning to develop various recipes using the barks.{nl}Whenever I eat meats, my gum starts to bleed and I feel weakened.
{nl}I cannot help but to doubt his innocence.{nl}Why were they here and where was he at the time of the murder.
We had to ask the help from Klaipeda in order to save the abbey.{nl}If the Revelators were there, things would have been different.{nl}

As the last head of this family, it is my wish to lead it with renewed glory.{nl}Find me the seal in the Legwyn Family Residence and I will teach you the ways of the Squire.
If you could help me, I think the investigation would be done sooner.{nl}It will be also a great chance to test your skills as an Alchemist.
Do you understand what I am trying to tell you?{nl}With that being said, let's see your skills as a Templar.
Now stop stalling and go power up the Transmutation Magic Circle.{nl}All you have to do is put the ingredients on the circle {nl}and emancipate the magic from the tombstone.{nl}
I have no memory of where all the gems are nor the location of the revelation..{nl}Perhaps, my other soul piece would have that information.{nl}
Either activating secret devices to attack demons... {nl}Or destroy demon devices or magic circles. Do whatever you seem fit.{nl}
Huh?{nl}A human... here?{nl}
Are you...{nl}...the Revelator?
{nl}It's you!{nl}I and the other Kupoles have all heard about you.
I'm investigating the Three-Layered Castle Wall with the other Kupoles.{nl}
The wall was built a millennium ago after the prediction of Goddess Laima.{nl}We didn't know what it meant then...{nl}
But I started to wonder about the true purpose of the wall...{nl}And so now we're looking for clues about the goddess' prediction.
Unfortunately it isn't easy investigating with all these monsters around.{nl}But we did discover something.
We found one of the many unknown devices hidden here.{nl}We were investigating it just now.
{nl}I wonder if you could help...{nl}Anything related to Goddess Laima's prediction ought to help you too, isn't it?
I knew we could count on you!{nl}Thank you!{nl}
I will give you something to note down the clues.{nl}Write down anything you find in here.{nl}
Maybe you can start with... the warehouse in District 8?{nl}There ought to be many things to look at there.
You might find things like Broken Magic Circles and magic stones there.
Are you back?
{nl}Hm... 
{nl}Those magic circles and stones can't have been for defending the castle...{nl}There must have been some other purpose to them.
Let's gather some more clues.{nl}If we find enough useful traces, they could lead us to an important clue.
You can go to the document archive.{nl}I'll go and look somewhere else.
Meet me here again after the investigation.
You're back.{nl}Did you find anything useful?
{nl}Shall we have a look, then?
You've collected a lot of materials.{nl}I think we can work something out from this.
Let me show you what I found first.{nl}Tell me what you think.
Then the wall was built to prepare for Medzio Diena...{nl}We should have listened to Goddess Laima then...
{nl}Truth is, there is nothing we can do about it now...{nl}If anything, you should tell my fellow Kupole in District 9 about the wall.
{nl}The Kupole working there is called Liepa.{nl}Please go and tell her.
Are you here to see me?{nl}Who might you be?
The Revelator!{nl}Yes, do tell me more.
So the wall was to prepare us for Medzio Diena...{nl}If you were able to find that much in District 8, you might be able to find something here as well.
{nl}Would you investigate a little further with us?{nl}We want to know how the preparations for Medzio Diena took place.
To investigate Inner Wall District 9 you'll need some documents from the Command Center.{nl}The problem is the room is occupied by monsters, so it won't be easy to access.
You'll join our investigation?{nl}That's wonderful, thank you!
In the Command Center, you'll find record documents with information about the installations.{nl}You may bring them to me.
Just be careful, the monsters there are vicious.
The records...
{nl}Oh, you've found them!{nl}Let me have a look.
According to these records, there should be some places nearby worthy of investigating.{nl}Also...
{nl}While I read the rest of the documents, will you find me a Scroll of Projection?{nl}We will need one to continue our investigations.
I'll be sorting out important information from these documents meanwhile.
The records might be able to tell us where to look next.
Good to see you found it.{nl}I was actually worried it had disappeared.
{nl}To tell you the truth, there weren't as many monsters when we first started investigating.{nl}That's why we didn't take the Scroll of Projection right away.
{nl}But then, just when we needed to use it, the monsters had already taken over...{nl}I'm glad you were here to help this time!
I've marked all the sites we need to search and all the important information on the documents.{nl}You may use it to continue investigating.
And do take the Scroll of Projection with you.{nl}You'll need it to investigate the first item, the Impact Absorption Magic Circle.
I'll just finish preparing some things and then go the opposite direction.{nl}Meet me after the investigation.
Things sure are moving along more quickly with you here, Revelator...{nl}You truly are amazing.
You've returned.{nl}I've also just arrived.
{nl}Did you search all the sites I noted?
We should be able to induce something from here.{nl}Let's have a look.
This means the castle wall wasn't enough for Medzio Diena.{nl}All the preparations were done, they just weren't used correctly, it seems.
{nl}But I wonder what went wrong, exactly.{nl}We must have missed something.
I do have a hunch about one location.{nl}I haven't been able to investigate it yet because of the monsters but...
{nl}I wonder what else is left there.{nl}The meeting room over there.
The monsters made a complete mess out of that meeting room.{nl}They could very well be holding clues... Would you hunt them?
They knew the date, and they were ready, but nothing was set in motion...{nl}The preparations for Medzio Diena, that is.
It all seems very strange.
These are... written orders.{nl}
But it's strange.{nl}No matter how I read them, I can't understand these orders.
{nl}It's almost as if they were trying to separate the people managing and protecting this land.
{nl}It looks like someone might have interfered with the plans on purpose.{nl}If these orders were meant to stop the preparations for Medzio Diena from being carried out...{nl}
That means the wall core shown in those classified manuals must contain something important.{nl}Go to Outer Wall District 9 and show the manual to the Kupole there.{nl}Her name is Milda.
Kupole Milda
So this wall was built to prepare for Medzio Diena...{nl}But for some unknown reason the preparations weren't carried out as they should.
{nl}Oh, sorry, I didn't even introduce myself.{nl}I'm Milda, I'm in charge of investigating Outer Wall District 9.
{nl}As you know, in this area there's something called the core.{nl}We think investigating this core will tell us the reason why the preparations for Medzio Diena never took place.
{nl}The problem is that the core is highly protected, and for several other reasons... It hasn't been easy investigating it.
Yes.{nl}That's why I need to be careful around here.{nl}We can talk more after the monsters' numbers have been reduced a little.
I'm worried about the monsters.{nl}There's something else going on here.
We'll never see the end of it at this pace.{nl}Something keeps attracting monsters to Outer Wall District 9.
{nl}There must a reason for it to happen...
I'll give you my investigation notes.{nl}I recorded everything in them.
It's hard for me to move around because of the monsters...{nl}But you should be able to investigate the core using my notes and the equipment manual.
Just be careful.{nl}More and more strong monsters are gathering.
What could be making the monsters gather like that?
You've brought the core!{nl}I can feel the strong energy of Goddess Laima in it.
{nl}This looks powerful enough to destroy the entire castle wall...{nl}But...
{nl}Something feels strange.
{nl}There is demon energy in this.{nl}This means the core was contaminated by evil energy after it was created...
{nl}It must have been the demons!{nl}You must tell Jore about this!
I'll stay here and look for a way to purify the core.{nl}This may very well be our key to ridding the world of the Divine Tree.
Did you find anything else?
I hope the power of Laima in the core can still be restored...
A core containing Laima's powerful energy...{nl}But you say it was contaminated with evil energy?
{nl}Looking at your notes, you seem to have found a lot.{nl}Let's get them organized, then.
Let's see what we have so far.
Goddess Laima predicted Medzio Diena... and the castle wall was built to prepare for it...{nl}But the demons prevented any measures from being put into practice...
{nl}I wonder if you coming here and helping us discover this information was also in her predictions...?
{nl}Us Kupoles must now purify the dark magic inside the core.{nl}If we can use the power of Laima in the core, we may just find something to use against the Divine Tree.
{nl}On behalf of all of us, I would like to thank you for letting Laima lead you to us, Revelator.{nl}You'll come see us again, won't you?
I'm very certain that there is something hidden in the castle wall.{nl}That is what I am investigating.
Ah... We should have all listened to Goddess Laima then...
In any case, Her predictions aren't final.{nl}The actions of humans can always produce different outcomes.
{nl}In my opinion, predictions can never be definitive.{nl}Only an extremely passive and apathetic being can be predicted with absolute certainty.
Not even Goddess Laima's predictions are definitive.{nl}The actions of humans can always produce different outcomes.
{nl}If you think about it, predictions can never be definitive.{nl}Only an extremely passive and apathetic being can be predicted with absolute certainty.
{nl}In any case I believe that might be the reason why Laima put Her trust in humans.
What could have happened here at the castle wall...?
I can't believe the demons had a hand in this...
The clues we found at Inner Wall District 8 are important evidence, we should show them to the other Kupoles.{nl}I'm worried that the monsters will try and damage them, though.
Will you?{nl}Thank you, I'm really glad you can help.
I can see why Goddess Laima chose you, Revelator.
Thank you.{nl}That should be enough.
You're in danger here.{nl}Hurry up and leave.
What Ebonypawn did can never be forgiven.{nl}For the sake of those who died in his hands, you must...
Come see me if you meet anyone working for the kingdom.
I'd be glad to see you again.
Supply Soldier's Spirit
I thought there was no one left here but other spirits wandering away from the goddess...
{nl}But if you're here, won't you listen to my request?{nl}Before I died I was a supply soldier, I transported materials to the castle wall.
{nl}I was on my way to transporting some goods requested by the families of the soldiers working at the castle wall.{nl}That day was Medzio Diena.
{nl}I died that day... and so did all the soldiers at the wall...{nl}The goods I was transporting are still strewn around Uzsmirsote Way...
{nl}I would like to deliver the supplies I was transporting then to the soldiers who died with me.{nl}If you can... Would you gather those supplies?
Thank you.{nl}You will see the boxes containing the supplies spread around Uzsmirsote Way.
{nl}I would help find them if I could, but after I became a spirit I'm unable to move away from here.
Even in the care of the goddess, those soldiers' objects will mean something to them.{nl}Thank you.
Did you gather them all?{nl}
Hm... Is this all there was...?
I suppose with time a lot of them went missing.{nl}Most of the boxes seem to be gone now.
I've seen the monsters go through the boxes sometimes...{nl}They must have stolen some of the supplies.{nl}
Would you search the monsters for other supplies, too?
Sigh... I'm really sorry to be asking this to a stranger.
A lot of soldiers in this area didn't survive Medzio Diena, as far as I can tell.
Yes, this is everything as I remember it.{nl}Thank you.
{nl}I will take these supplies and return to the goddess now.{nl}Finally I can complete my last mission.
Castle Wall Soldier's Spirit
Hey. What's a human doing here...{nl}
I used to be a soldier working here at the castle wall.{nl}As you can see I kicked the can and all that's left is my spirit now...{nl}
So many other soldiers I used to work with didn't make it...{nl}No idea what happened to those guys now.{nl}
I want to think they're with the goddess, but what if they're not, you know?{nl}So I was thinking, would you do me and my buddies a favor?
You're a... nice fellow, aren't you?{nl}
I wanna help guide their spirits to the goddess.{nl}But as you can see, I can't move much in this state.{nl}
Okay. First, if you go to Deengo Hill, you'll see their stuff lying around.{nl}Just bring it all over.
Can you believe they left without even taking their stuff?{nl}Not that it's any of my business but...
Did you bring the stuff?{nl}
Now, here's what you to do next.
There's a sanctum in Kule Peak that's full of forest energy.{nl}I want you to dump the stuff into the sanctum and pull all that forest energy to get the sanctum running.
{nl}It's what they do to soldiers who die at the castle wall, after gathering all their remains and stuff.{nl}Like a memorial service, you know?
{nl}I know it's been a long time now, but it's the least I can do.
Okay, but first you need to find this sanctum.{nl}The forest energy went a little crazy after Medzio Diena so I can't be sure where it is anymore.{nl}
There's gonna be a place in Kule Center where you can really feel the forest energy.{nl}It's gonna be stronger than in any other spot around there.
It was by the water, if I'm not mistaken...
You did it.{nl}My buddies are gonna thank you for this.
{nl}Glad I finally got that out of my chest, guess I'll be going to the goddess now.{nl}Thanks a lot.
Scout Soldier's Spirit
There are many soldiers whose lives were sacrificed on Medzio Diena here.{nl}I am one of them.
{nl}But there's something I can't let go of until this day.{nl}That's why I still haven't found my way to the goddess.
{nl}I was on my way to scout Kule Peak when I saw something...{nl}The shock of dying must have been too great, because I can't remember very well.
{nl}I wrote everything on my report, but it's lost now.
Thank you so much for helping me.{nl}
Some time ago I saw the monsters at the Dead-End Road carrying around scraps of paper.{nl}I think they're from my report.{nl}
You should be able to find some if you search the monsters there.
It's funny how I remember the moment I died so vividly.{nl}I would rather have forgotten it...
Yes, that's it.
Let's see...{nl}Hmm...{nl}
Oh, I remember!
{nl}I noticed some sculptures scattered in Sugrizimas Way.{nl}They were glowing and giving off a strange energy.{nl}
I didn't know what they were, so I didn't try to handle them, but I was going to report it to my superiors.{nl}I suppose there's no one to report it to now, so why don't we investigate ourselves?
I hope I'll finally be able to solve this mystery.{nl}
First, go to Sugrizimas Way and collect the glowing sculptures.{nl}We should be able to find out something about them.
Run if you see anything that looks dangerous.
Did you bring the sculptures?
Oh! This is...
The divine bead of Kule Peak.{nl}It looks broken, but I'm certain this is it.{nl}
This was at the goddess' altar which was forgotten after the castle wall was built.{nl}I heard it had belonged to a goddess who no one remembers.{nl}
It's a shame an object like this has ended up broken.{nl}It should be restored and placed back on the altar.
It should be more resistant now.
{nl}It would be best to clear out some monsters near the altar first, just to be safe.{nl}Defeat the monsters in Lychimas Fields before returning the bead to the altar.
{nl}It's time for me to return to the goddess now.{nl}Thank you for helping me resolve my issue.
I am sure the forgotten goddess will want to bless you.
I was just about to arrive at the castle wall with the goods...{nl}I felt the earth shake and, next thing I know, I was like this.
I wonder if my buddies are with the goddess...{nl}I sure hope they're not still wandering around somewhere...
The day I died is what people call Medzio Diena now.{nl}I can say I was the first victim.
Forest Keeper Brunonas
I've never seen the leaves fall like this in my many years working as a forest keeper.{nl}I really haven't.
Let me know if you find anything.
Herbalist Cesaris
I don't know what it is.{nl}The leaves just keep falling.
{nl}It's only happening here, from what I heard.
It's been like this since Medzio Diena.
Lumberjack Dowedas
When the weather is nice and dry, it's good for lumberjacks like me.
No idea why the leaves keep falling.{nl}I mean, as a lumberjack I'm glad the weather's nice and dry but.
Chronomancer Ida
My mentor sent me here to investigate the foliage problem.
She believed the flow of time in this region was twisted...{nl}So she sent me here to investigate.
{nl}And she was right.
Kupole Lina
The Kupoles alone aren't enough to handle this many trees.{nl}So I've decided to use nutrition supplements.
Kupole Aeglei
Tell Lina this if you see her.{nl}If she ever does anything like this again, she'll regret it!
Refugee Representative Morcus
My brother and I were both soldiers...{nl}But I was injured during training and had to be discharged early...
{nl}That's why it's still hard for me to move around.{nl}I don't whether to call this injury a blessing or a curse...
Ejuidas
The foliage situation in this forest is serious.{nl}It can be hard for people with poor mental conditions to endure.
{nl}That's why I'm here anyways...
A child? The little one is called Willitte?
{nl}Oh, I remember.{nl}I saw them crying, waiting for their dad, so I told them to make a leaf whistle and pray to the goddess.
{nl}Didn't think the little one would believe it.
Little Willitte
My daddy will come if I make a leaf whistle.
{nl}That man said so.
You delivered the information to my mentor.{nl}Thank you.
{nl}Brunonas was also interested in the results of my investigation.{nl}He is the forest keeper, after all.
{nl}Please tell him, too.{nl}And thank you for your help.
Gotta do things in the right order.{nl}Go and tell Ida first.
You should read the notes I put together when you can. It will help.
I've worked as a forest keeper for decades and I'd never seen the trees like this.{nl}Time must be really twisted here, then...
Tell my mentor about the results of the investigation, she'll have something to tell you too.
Brunonas will be waiting.
You only need to tell Ida.{nl}I'll write the summary of the investigation.
Refugee Hilda
I came here as a refugee but...{nl}It's very hard out here, too.
{nl}I guess, for people who lost everything, anywhere will be hard.{nl}This world or another world, does it make a difference?
The forest isn't dying.{nl}The foliage is what's keeping the trees safe from the vegetation problem.{nl}But one Kupole hasn't figured that out yet.
This strange feeling won't go away.{nl}Let me go back to the bonfire.
So Victoras wants to know the contents of the document...
The situation in Nheto Forest had been reported to affect the minds of refugees in nearby areas as well.{nl}I thought it was important to study the forest and the irregularities in it.
{nl}And so, as a user of time magic myself, I formulated a hypothesis.{nl}I sent out Ida to investigate based on that hypothesis.
{nl}I will reorganize the information in this report.{nl}Please let Ida know on your way back.
I fought with Ruklys against the traitors until the very end at the Fortress of the Land.{nl}I wished to accompany him in his final moments, but he requested that I clear his name.
{nl}And so, I took proof of his innocence and fled south with a few subordinates.{nl}I had wanted to tell those who resented the tyranny of Kadumel about Ruklys' innocence.
{nl}I had hoped we could join forces to take revenge on the king and his advisor.{nl}However, Eminent assigned elite troops to General Victoras to chase after us.
{nl}Then, a tormented soldier on our side surrendered the box of documents to Victoras.{nl}That is when I decided to face Victoras and fight him.
{nl}Alas, our battle ended in a tragic mutual casualty.{nl}As much as time may have passed, I have yet to ammend the injustice perpetrated upon Ruklys.
Kupole Siute
I was barely able to succumb to the power of the darkness...{nl}But I am really glad you're here.
{nl}I'm sorry... and also grateful.
The Tri-Layered Castle Wall is composed of the inner, outer and central walls.{nl}As I mentioned before, it was built under the instruction of Goddess Laima.
{nl}The other Kupoles and I were investigating the wall.{nl}We figured there must be something hidden there, a clue to the truth.
I demand to know!{nl}But first to tell the people at the village...!
{nl}My legs may be mangled but I will find out where my brother is, so help me the goddess!
I guess Lina and I wanted the same thing after all.{nl}To save the forest.
{nl}We just had different ways to do it. I still think I was right though.
Believer Jaonus
I belong to a small order that worships the goddesses.{nl}I came after the refugees of this site reported feeling an evil energy in the area.
{nl}If you have the chance, won't you come and join our order?
Believer Costas
So you met Jaonus?{nl}We belong to a small order that worships the goddesses.
We couldn't just stand by and look as the forest withered on.
I've lost my honor as member of the Royal Army, and my own life now.{nl}If I keep you safe, will I be able to repent?{nl}
Please, I beg you{nl}Rid us of the cursed statues and the demons, and cure us of this disease.
There, it's finished.{nl}I had to rush it so it's a little rough; please be careful with it.
The seeds... they look different.
Oscaras?said he was going to get Vink flowers and left.{nl}And the symptoms keep getting worse... I hope nothing happens.
Oscaras is gone.{nl}We should go find him.
I'm tired beyond exhaustion.{nl}I didn't know it would be this hard...
According to the legends, the Flower of Vaivora will only bloom before a very special aura.{nl}So I brought it here hoping to find somewhat special people but...
{nl}All I found were frauds and con artists.{nl}This whole ordeal has been more than tiring...
{nl}But I think I finally found someone!{nl}If only you will help me, Vaivora's Koru will finally bloom!
You are very kind.{nl}Who might you be?
{nl}...{nl}Hm?
{nl}A revelator?{nl}Are you saying you're a revelator?
{nl}Oh... Well if that's so...{nl}Will you listen to my story?
{nl}After Medzio Diena, the goddesses would no longer answer our prayers.{nl}Because of this, many started to doubt or deny the very existence of the goddesses.
{nl}I, for one, was certain that there must be a reason why the goddesses weren't answering.{nl}A legend is told of a flower that grows in Arcus Forest. Ask this flower anything, and it will answer you.
{nl}This flower is called Vaivora's Koru.{nl}I came here to make Vaivora's Koru bloom and find out where the goddesses are.
{nl}But now... I don't even know where its seeds are...
You're right!{nl}Those could be the seeds of Vaivora's Koru!
{nl}To tell the truth... Having the seeds alone isn't enough to make the flower bloom.{nl}According to the legend, the special one must hold the seeds in their hand and submerge them in a pool of water to claim them.
{nl}If that's you...!{nl}You, the revelator...!
{nl}Down here is a puddle of water.{nl}Go there and submerge the seeds!
If you really are the special one told in the legend, the seeds will react and change.
Oh... The seeds have been claimed...
{nl}The legend became true!{nl}After all the frauds and tricks...!
The legend says that, once claimed, the seeds will feed off the energy of the special one.{nl}They will disappear if touched by anyone other than the special one.
{nl}Won't you help me grow Vaivora's Koru?
Go to Juzmitas Altar and plant the seeds there.{nl}The legend says Vaivora's Koru requires divine energy to blossom.
{nl}In the past, Arcus Forest was the place where worshipping ceremonies for Goddess Vaivora were held.{nl}Some of that divine energy is still present in the altar.
{nl}Go there and plant the seeds.{nl}I will go first.
{nl}Moving around hasn't been easy because of the monsters, but I feel safe with you.{nl}
Oh... I'm afraid the divine energy here won't be enough for Vaivora's Koru...{nl}It seems to have been damaged...
And fully repairing the altar would take far too much time.{nl}Unless...
{nl}Hm, yes.{nl}Around this altar there are several remains of collapsed stone pillars.
{nl}Those pillars were used to cleanse away evil energies during worshiping ceremonies to Goddess Vaivora.{nl}They may be only remains, but some of their past divine energy will still be present.
{nl}If we could find a way to transfer the divine energy from the pillars to the altar...{nl}We may be able to restore its power.
You've collected the Lyecorn Essences.{nl}This should be enough for the orb.
{nl}We'll need to purify the evil energy, but I can do that myself.{nl}I might need more materials, however...
I will cleanse the Lyecorn Essence and transfer the divine energy from the pillar remains to the altar.
This much should suffice.
There is one more thing I need to purify the Lyecorn essence...{nl}Arcus braken, the type that grows in Arcus Forest.
The stems of Arcus bracken are covered in dense hairs and they're very firm.{nl}Stems that have been steeped in divine energy can purify evil forces.
Arcus braken seemed to grow mostly at the Meilan Intersection.
I'll use this Arcus bracken to purify the Lyecorn essence.{nl}Just a moment.
The Lyecorn Essence is now purified and the orb is completed.
Now you'll need to imbue the essence with divine energy.{nl}Use it near the pillar fragments and an orb of divine energy will appear.
{nl}The orb will contain the divine energy in the essence and transmit it.{nl}If the orb disappears, you'll need to use more of the essence.
{nl}I will stay at the altar and prepare it for the energy transmission.
Use the essence near the pillar fragments.{nl}The orb that appears in the essence will deliver the divine energy contained in them.
You've brought the divine energy.{nl}I am also finished with preparations.
I have created a magic circle to transfer the divine energy from the essence to the altar.{nl}You can place the essence onto the magic circle.
{nl}Also, don't forget to plant the Koru seeds!
After you place the essence on the magic circle, the divine energy will move towards the altar.
The essence is placed on the magic circle, but it doesn't react...{nl}I don't think there's anything wrong with the circle...
{nl}What could be the problem...?
Oh, when you were placing the essence on the magic circle, that flower over there looked a little strange.
{nl}Would you...{nl}Remove that flower for me?{nl}
It looks suspicious somehow.
A flower that draws divine energy, how strange...{nl}My life would have been in danger if it weren't for you.
{nl}The claimed seeds have started to react as told in the legend.{nl}Soon the Flower of Vaivora will bloom.
{nl}I will pray now and ask to know the whereabouts of the goddesses.{nl}Help me so I may focus on my prayer.
Vaivora's Koru has answered me and told me about the goddesses.{nl}I'm sure you too will want to know where they are.
Of course.{nl}I will tell you where the goddesses are.
You have strengthened my faith in the goddesses ever so more.{nl}I will now find a way to prove to the people what the Koru has revealed!
{nl}Thank you.
In the past, Phamer Forest was affected by a deadly disease that caused high fevers.{nl}This disease was never completely eradicated, so you should avoid staying long.
{nl}I am researching the period when the disease first struck.{nl}I'm doing so as a pupil of the Plague Doctor Master, who investigates infectious diseases himself...
{nl}Sigh, the thing is...
{nl}If it's alright, do you mind if I share my predicament?{nl}My research hasn't really been leading anywhere, and it's making me miserable...
{nl}The information I was given when I first arrived was far too little.{nl}Date of occurrence, number of casualties, symptoms... that was it.
{nl}It was impossible arriving at any conclusions with this little information...
{nl}All I learned was that the disease started manifesting differently after Medzio Diena.{nl}In this state, if I don't talk to someone about this I feel as if the disease will take over my own self...
I feel much better knowing someone is willing to help.{nl}Though I understand you have no knowledge of the disease...
{nl}Oh, by the way.
{nl}I should tell you something before we start.{nl}We don't know how one becomes infected with this disease, so you must be careful at all times.
{nl}Alright, first we need to collect substances likely to cause the disease to occur.{nl}You may bring some Bunkeybo and Bunkeyto skins, along with Phamer bracken and Tulups.
{nl}You'll find Phamer bracken and Tulups growing by the Atvis Falls, to the right side of the camp.
There will be plenty of Phamer bracken and Tulups by the Atvis Falls.
This should be enough to study the causes of the disease.{nl}Alright, now...
We need test subjects that we can put in contact with the materials you collected.{nl}There are a few monsters I selected as subjects; I would like you to bring them.
I would like Bunkeytos and Bunkeybos to use as test subjects and some water.{nl}You may bring the water from the Atvis Falls nearby, but the monsters need to be hunted.
{nl}Use this tranquilizer on monsters after weakening them.{nl}It will knock them down instantly so you should have no trouble capturing them.
While you gather the test subjects, I will make a cage for the monsters.
The cage for the monsters is completed.
{nl}Please put the monsters inside the cage.
We can get started on the experiments now...{nl}I just hope the monsters will cooperate.
Have the Bunkeybo smell the Phamer bracken.{nl}Then feed the Tulup flower to the Bunkeyto.
Meanwhile I'll be observing the substances released from the monsters' skin.
Let's wait and see how the monsters react.
I ran some tests and... My condition doesn't seem right...{nl}I think I might have been infected with the disease...
{nl}This can't be happening...{nl}I can't have this disease...{nl}I must have made a mistake checking the results.
{nl}I can't be sick... I was so careful...{nl}It can't be!
{nl}No!
Sigh...{nl}I need to calm myself down...
{nl}Hold on a second... Sigh...
{nl}Did...{nl}... you have the Bunkeybo smell the Phamer bracken?
{nl}The last time I tested there was no reaction, but this time the disease manifested.{nl}It seems the substances that cause the disease are found in some of the Phamer bracken.
{nl}I would like you to bring me all the Phamer bracken you can, in all stages of development.
I'm planning to separate the bracken into younger specimens and more developed ones to test.{nl}I'm really glad to have someone here to help me.
{nl}If this were to happen when I was all alone...{nl}I can't even imagine.
I'll analyse the bracken.
I've got the test results.{nl}It seems the spores of developed bracken are harmless to the human body.
{nl}But in the respiratory system of Bunkeybos, they become deadly.{nl}Humans who are bitten by them or otherwise come into contact with their bodily fluids can become infected as well.
As for the cure... the answer is in the Bunkeytos!{nl}The disease still manifests in them, but I noticed it disappeared rather quickly.
{nl}It turns out the magic of Bunkeyto essence, when combined with another material, generates a substance that gives them immunity!{nl}This can be used to create a cure!
I will just need to find out what the magic in the Bunkeyto essence is reacting with.
I'm starting to have the symptoms.{nl}Be careful not to become infected yourself...
The amount you brought should be enough.
While you were away I found the substance that reacts with the Bunkeyto Essence.
{nl}It's Vink flowers.{nl}The combination of these flowers and Bunkeyto Essence creates an antidote.
{nl}The problem is that creating enough antidote to cure one person requires a large amount of Vink flowers.
Vink flowers are scarce even in Phamer Forest, and they're rather hard to spot.{nl}However, when they react to Bunkeyto Essences, a pearl of red light appears.
{nl}If you use the magic in the Bunkeyto Essence, you'll be able to find Vink flowers where the pearls of light appear.{nl}Hurry on to Tarnis Falls.
My symptoms are getting worse, I'm having difficulty standing up.{nl}It could be the fever... I'm getting chills too...
{nl}You brought the Vink flowers.{nl}We need to go to back to camp to make the medicine, but in my condition...
I'm worried that you'll become infected if you carry me all the way to camp.{nl}I... would rather you make the medicine at the camp and then bring it to me.
All you need to do is mix the Bunkeyto essence and the Vink flowers in a 3:7 ratio.{nl}It's not too difficult, you should be able to get it done quickly.
The Bunkeyto essence and Vink flowers should be mixed in a ratio of 3:7.
Did you finish the antidote?
Oh, it seems the antidote is working already.{nl}I feel a lot better.
{nl}I'm so thankful.{nl}You helped me progress so much in my research, and now I even have an antidote.
{nl}If it weren't for you I would've been miserable with no such thing as a cure.
{nl}I will go back to camp now and prepare to report everything to the Plague Doctor Master.
No... We can't lose Dalia...
Placed the knocked out monsters inside the cage.
I'm researching new ways to use monster corpses in battle.{nl}And I need a lot of magic infused blood for my research.
{nl}If you're here, it's because you wanna advance as a Necromancer, am I right?{nl}Then give me a hand with the research and get me that magic infused blood.
{nl}It ain't an easy task, of course.{nl}What do you say?
Cool.{nl}I'm gonna give you an orb.
{nl}Use the orb on monsters and they'll be branded with something called the Seal of Disinter.{nl}Defeat the monsters with the seal and they'll leave behind a pool of magic infused blood.
{nl}One thing, though. The Seal of Disinter goes away after a while, so remember that.{nl}And don't be too bummed if you don't see the seal, it can fail sometimes if you don't control your magic right.
I made this orb especially hard to handle for regular Necromancers.{nl}I'm gonna see the way you deal with it and judge your skills from that.
Yup, I think you're good enough for me to teach you my more advanced stuff.{nl}I'm surprised, actually.
Ah, you came at the right time.
{nl}Crystal Mine Lot 2 has Vubbes even more vicious and powerful than Lot 1.{nl}I'm trying to think of a way to keep the Vubbes in Lot 2 from going out into the Miner's Village.
{nl}Blocking the entrance would be the surest way, but also the most dangerous.{nl}So I am planning to create a scent to scare away the Vubbes and place it in Lot 2.
{nl}I'll work a lot faster with your help.{nl}And it'll be a good chance to test your Alchemist skills, wouldn't you say?
There are three more materials I need.
{nl}Blue Beetow salivary glands, half-digested grass and monster parasites.{nl}You can obtain these from the monsters in Khamadon Forest, Nheto Forest and Inner Wall District 9, respectively.
You can obtain the items by defeating the monsters in Khamadon Forest, Nheto Forest and Inner Wall District 9.
Well done.{nl}As promised, I will allow you to achieve a higher level as an Alchemist.
{nl}And then you may create the scent.
Warlocks must know how to rule over and control evil spirits.{nl}Your control skills do not seem fully developed yet.
{nl}Use my Seal of Dominance to find hidden evil spirits and absorb them.{nl}I will teach you my techniques if you can prove your expertise in using the Seal.
Use my Seal of Dominance to find hidden evil spirits and absorb them.
Impressive.{nl}You fared better than I expected.
{nl}Let's help you take the next step as a Warlock, then.{nl}But don't get comfortable just yet.
{nl}No creature likes being controlled.{nl}Always remember that the one you're trying to control may also try to control you.
I think I know why you're here.{nl}I can help you reach the next level as Featherfoot if you help me.
{nl}Have you ever been to Khonot Forest?{nl}The forest is home to the wandering spirits of soldiers who died fighting each other a long time ago.
{nl}We believe that's the reason why their belongings are cursed with resentment.{nl}I worry that someone will get hurt if they do something with their objects.
{nl}I would like you to gather all their belongings and bring them to me.
{nl}A curse is still a curse, no matter how weak... There's a chance you'll be cursed too when you try to pick up their objects.{nl}If so, you can use my Seal of Disarmament to clear the curse.
You must use the Seal of Disarmament right away if the curse falls on you.
You're back with the soldiers' belongings.{nl}Let's help you onto your new stage as a Featherfoot, then.
I don't know if you're aware, but I commune with plants spiritually.{nl}I can feel the plants at the Oasseu Memorial suffering from evil energies this very instant.
{nl}Help me purify the evil forces away from these plants and I will teach you about the next stage of the Druid.{nl}I will give you the Orb of Purification you need for this task.
To advance as a Druid you must be able to commune with nature and listen to it.{nl}The plights of the Oasseu Memorial plants fill me with sorrow.
I no longer hear the cries of the plants in the Oasseu Memorial!{nl}I was worried I had asked you far too much, but you did so well.
{nl}As promised, I will help you then.
I am well aware why you're here.{nl}I will grant you your wish, should you provide me with your help.
{nl}Recently, a place once guarded by divine energy has been overtaken by demons whose evil energy is growing stronger.{nl}It has come to the point where clairvoyance has no effect there.
{nl}I will ask you to rid that place of the evil energy.{nl}Help me do this and I will help you achieve the next level of Oracle.
Your target is the Workshop.{nl}What you need to do is defeat the demons there.
I'm afraid having demons run rampant is a common occurrence in these troubled times.{nl}Please rid the Workshop of its demons.
I knew you were the right person to do this.{nl}As promised, I will lead you to the next level of the Oracle.
Lately there have been several reports of people falling ill after being attacked by monsters.{nl}Those affected have all been attacked by the same species of monster.
{nl}We suspect it might be either beast or plant type monsters.{nl}The symptoms can be cured rather easily, but it pains me to see the people falling ill to the disease.
{nl}That is why I plan to develop a vaccine.{nl}Bring me the samples I need for the vaccine and I shall teach you the ways of the Plague Doctor.
You may hunt the monsters in any region.{nl}They simply need to be beast and plant type monsters.
For samples I need the blood of beast monsters and the body fluid of plant monsters.{nl}They can be from any region.
You collected the samples.{nl}I can use them to develop my vaccine now.
{nl}Without the grace of the goddesses we once had, us humans need to develop our medical practice.{nl}I urge you to make good use of the Plague Doctor techniques I have taught you and contribute to our science.
A Kabbalist is required to understand the meaning behind the numbers hidden in every being and substance.
{nl}As such, I would like to give you a somewhat difficult task.{nl}Are you prepared?
Use my crystal sphere at the Inner Wall District 9 and you will see numbers.{nl}Those numbers will signify a particular monster.
{nl}Solve the mystery hidden in the numbers and defeat the target monster.{nl}You must find the meaning behind the numbers and how they relate to this monster.
{nl}Use the sphere again if you are uncertain.{nl}The numbers may signal a different monster and you may infer the rules from there.
Defeat the monster told by the numbers of the crystal sphere at Inner Wall District 9.{nl}Finding out the monster behind the numbers is a task you must complete on your own.
When you realize it, it's nothing special. But it is a duty of the Kabbalist to study on the process.{nl}If you keep trying, you will realize the meanings of the numbers.
Sage Master
My duty involves recovering works of knowledge and reestablishing the study of magic.{nl}With the kingdom library destroyed and our science undermined, it's what we as Sages must do.
{nl}Help me and I shall teach you the spatial magic of the Sages.
Your task starts with finding the books in Mage Tower 2F, Elgos Monastery Main Building and Inner Wall District 9.{nl}The books I'm looking for are titled Sage Baseline, The Goddess' Abode of Mount Monderor Volume I and Book of the Void.
Find the three books I'm looking for.
The Book of the Void is one that I personally need as Sage Master.{nl}As a token of appreciation for your dedication, I will teach you the magic of the Sages.
Enchanter Master
Enchanters work by applying or extracting magic from objects.{nl}But to become one, you must first pass a small test.
It's still a little too early to ask you to fully extract magic from objects.{nl}Instead, go to Fedimian and absorb the magic of the memories and desires contained in its pots.
{nl}Use my Absorption Orb for this task.{nl}Your score will depend on how much magic you can bring me in this orb.
The pots in Fedimian contain the memories and desires of many people.
{nl}With the Absorption Orb you can obtain those memories in the form of magic.
You've gathered more magic than I expected.{nl}You shouldn't have any problems learning enchanting techniques at all, it seems.
{nl}As promised, let's take you to the higher stage of Enchanter.
Taoist Master
I'm afraid I can't tell you about the higher stage of Taoist without prior preparation.
{nl}I will give you an amulet.{nl}Return after you have used it on the monsters of Nheto Forest.
{nl}Only then will you be prepared as a Taoist.
Use the amulet against the monsters of Nheto Forest and experience its effects.
Have you made sufficient use of the amulet?{nl}Then I shall help you become the brilliant Taoist you desire.
Inquisitor Master
Inquisitors are judges, we deliver judgements.{nl}And with the goddesses disappeared, we must also take up Their obligations.
{nl}This places even heavier responsibilities upon us as judges.{nl}The day Inquisitors are unable to withstand these burdens is the day our world will collapse into turmoil.
Make sure to read carefully and understand the Inquisitor's Creed and Decree.{nl}Then, find the objects instilled with heretic energy and prove your talent as judge.
Make sure to read carefully and understand the Decree I wrote.
You have proven your talent and passion for judgement.{nl}Always remember the Inquisitor's Creed and Decree.
There were reports of people whose mental condition was affected by the foliage phenomenon.{nl}I believe some compromise is needed to save those who are still healthy.
Kupole Leda
This place is too dangerous for travelers.{nl}If you have nothing else to tend to, I suggest you avoid coming here.
Devries Controller Spell Source
[Spell Source Activation Guide]{nl}Please, read the following instruction carefully.
{nl}1. Insert the spell of the user into the source.{nl}2. If the user's spell is not sufficient, please follow Step. 3.
{nl}3. Minute spell is accumulated in the monsters roaming around in this facility.{nl}Overpower them and collect the essence of spell and inject it to the source.
Central Laboratory's Magic Source
{nl}3. There are objects containing magic scattered around the Central Laboratory.{nl}Look for things around the area to recharge it with magic.
Researcher Auditorium's Magic Source
{nl}3. Refill the discharged generators with magic from the surrounding area.{nl}You will be able to use the Source for a long time if you use a fully charged generator.
You've came just in time.
{nl}I am researching another route to Fanstasy Library where Goddess Vaivora resides.{nl}However, my duties as a master hinder the process to a certain degree.
{nl}I have heard that you are looking for goddesses.{nl}Help me now and I will help you get to Goddess Vaivora in Fantasy Library.
{nl}What do you think of my offer?
There is one thing I need to tell you.
{nl}The crystal of Goddess Gegute cannot be used for a long period of time.{nl}The power source that can supply spell is necessary. 
{nl}Such spells are littered in Zima Suecourt.{nl}It will tell you when it needs recharging.
Do you wish to see the event of the past?{nl}They will appear like phantoms to you.
{nl}Use this crystal to see the past events that occurred in Zima Suecourt.{nl}Before we get going. I need to let you know on certain things...
I have set the crystal to the era when Agailla Flurry was alive.{nl}Take the crystal to Zima Suecourt.{nl}You will be able to have a glimpse of Agailla Flurry from the past.
{nl}Remember the things you see about Agailla Flurry in the crystal and tell me what you saw.{nl}However, you must be careful.
{nl}The crystal's magic will lure the monsters of Zima Suecourt.{nl}They will continue to hinder your work.
Feel free to do the research on your own terms.{nl}There isn't anything there that will be destroyed or explode anyways.
If I summerize what you have told me...
{nl}I thought the other entrance to the Fantasy Library would be a gap in space somewhere.{nl}It seems as if Agailla Flurry... made the entrance with magic.
{nl}If so, how about using the Kaleidoscope of Time?{nl}Maybe it will allow us to see what Agailla Flurry did in the Agailla Flurry.
{nl}Of course, it doesn't have anything to do with my research, but you could use it for your own interests if you are intruiged as a Revelator.{nl}Please use it while you are with colleagues for your own safety though.
{nl}There are many transportation devices within Zima Suecourt for convenient travel.{nl}They are still usable if you charge them.
{nl}I would also appreciate it if you would keep these facts to yourself.
To find the route to the Fantasy Library, you must find the trace of grand wizards.{nl}You will find the traces on the way from here, Stele Road to Zima Suecourt.
{nl}To find out the secret history of these traces, the crystal of Goddess Gegute.{nl}The crystal allows you to see the past events of a place and nearby objects.
{nl}Do you want to try it out here?{nl}I have already set the time period.
{nl}It would be a mystical experience.
How could he just abandon his duty as a servant of the kingdom?{nl}Our duty is to  protect the magic circle regardless of what happens.{nl}
As a soldier, I feel uncomfortable receiving help from an ordinary person like you, but...{nl}Horace who was helping us is lying in the tent at the moment.{nl}
Thank you for saving my life.{nl}I'm worried for the monastery, however. I wonder if my brothers are safe...
I can't see my own breath, but I'm freezing.{nl}This doesn't make any sense. Brrrr...
This is grave, we have demons hiding among our Order.{nl}You don't suppose our chiefs will know about this...?
We have reasons to believe this person is the culprit.{nl}Try and convince the other pilgrims if you believe otherwise.{nl}
If you can't prove that this person is innocent...{nl}We have no choice but to leave their faith up to the monastery.
That must have been a visual trickery. {nl}That brother was born in the Abbey and has lived there his entire life.{nl}
Only a handful of brethren including me managed to escape... {nl}I am deathly worried about all of them. I have no way of knowing what happened to the others.{nl}
Fine, whatever.{nl}Let's go meet him then.
I... don't know who I am... or where I am.{nl}I simply remember the name Hayatin...
I feel something I can't quite explain when I see those glowing monsters.{nl}For some reason, I feel as if there is someone I must save... but who...?
I believe we can restore Ruklys' honor if we reveal to the world the documents in his box.
I beg of you.{nl}Please, find Ruklys' document box.
I am forever thankful to you for proving Ruklys' innocence to the world.
Soon the day will come when Ruklys and the rest of us are free of all false charges.{nl}I am eternally grateful.
Traveler.{nl}Will you listen to my story?{nl}Though I may remember nothing but the name Hayatin...
{nl}Seeing the blue glowing monsters musters in me a feeling I can't quite explain.{nl}That is why I believe they're the key to recovering my memories.
Thank you.{nl}Being dead, there is not much I can do...{nl}Please, defeat the Blue Tanus and Blue Doyors for me.
I remember it all!{nl}What's important to me... My duties...
I am Hayatin, Ruklys' comrade.
{nl}I was asleep for a long, long time, until I suddenly awoke four years ago.{nl}Alas, I did not know who I was or what I ought to do, so I merely wandered.
{nl}But I remember it all now.{nl}I must find the document that proves Ruklys is innocent!
{nl}Dead as I am, there isn't much I can do.{nl}Please, be my help.
There was nearly no one left from Victoras' troops.{nl}However the document box could still be at the location where they were stationed.
{nl}I ask you to search Carejvines Hill, where his troops were stationed.{nl}I will be waiting at the place where we first met.
Yes. I am Victoras, a general of the Kingdom.{nl}I should first of all thank you for setting me free from the monsters.
{nl}I do not know what you seek in this decrepit place, but you have my help if you need it.
I had lost my sense of self and was running wild with the monsters like a beast.{nl}If anything I ought to thank you.
I wonder how many years have passed... Nothing looks the same as it once was.{nl}The bracken itself looks bizarre. What on earth happened here?
The entire world looks to have perished before a devious calamity.{nl}You must wonder why, during such calamity, I would plot to dishonor a hero like Ruklys.
I was merely following orders as a member of the army, though it led to the disgrace of a hero.{nl}It was unfortunate.
Hayatin... A name I missed.{nl}I do remember one of his subordinates handing me the document box.
{nl}I will help you find the box.{nl}But first, there is something I must do.
The spirits you see wandering nearby were once royal soldiers under my command.{nl}After conscription and a meaningless death, they seem to have been left wandering pointlessly.
{nl}As their superior, I feel like sending them to rest with the goddess is the least I can do.{nl}If it's not much to ask, would you build them a memorial stone?
{nl}Something simple will suffice.{nl}There are remains from the castle wall you can use which ought to work just fine.
Use the materials from the ruins to raise a simple sign on a stone base.
I simply want to honor them, rather than impress anyone.{nl}And I must say I'm grateful to you.
Now that the memorial stone is complete, would you guide their spirits to it?{nl}I don't think I should be the one to do it, seeing as I'm the one they likely resent.
Thank you.{nl}I will tell you more after their spirits are resting in comfort.
Please guide my subordinates' wandering spirits to the memorial stone.
I cannot thank you enough.{nl}Let me start by telling you what I know about the document box.
I willingly sacrificed my own life to follow the orders I was given.{nl}I believe my loyalty to the kingdom has been more than proven.{nl}There is no reason for me to keep any more secrets.
{nl}I received orders from Premier Eminent to obtain an important object Hayatin had in his possession when he fled.{nl}After a long pursuit, one of his subordinates surrendered the document box to me.
{nl}I hid the box under a sign only I recognize.{nl}The land may have changed with time, but I believe we can discover the box if only we find the sign.
I'm afraid I can no longer be certain of its exact location.{nl}Although I know it is in Carejvines Hill...
{nl}It will likely be in a spot with abundant bracken.{nl}I would start by burning the piles of bracken and checking for what's underneath them.
I, too, harbored my own suspicions about our quest to punish Ruklys.{nl}As the first disciple of Maven, he proved to be nothing less than a hero.
{nl}But as members of the army, our very lives depend on our orders.{nl}From where I stood, I had no choice but to follow the directions of the Premier.
{nl}It happened before the Fortress of the Land was overtook.{nl}We thought they were attacking, when it was confirmed that a detached force had fled southwards.
{nl}It was Hayatin and his soldiers.{nl}Our mission to pursuit Hayatin had only gotten longer.
{nl}Eventually one of his soldiers did surrender the document box to our side, but he could not be spared.{nl}You see, the Premier's second command was to eliminate all of Hayatin's forces.
{nl}My first command was to deliver the box directly to the Premier.{nl}That is why I hid it in a place unknown even by my subordinates.
It won't be easy skimming through the tangled bracken.{nl}Burning it is a better solution.
{nl}If you do find the document box, there is something I want to ask.{nl}I'm curious about the contents of the document the Premier was so keen on keeping secret.
{nl}If you will, please find out what the document contains. I want to know the truth.{nl}I want to know if Ruklys and Hayatin were in fact traitors...
Time may have worn it out, but I have no doubts.{nl}This is the document box Hayatin had in his possession.
If Hayatin seeks to recover this box, it is only right to return it to him.{nl}But first, I want to know the contents of the document.{nl}
Would you perhaps open it for me?
As dead as I am, I'm afraid there isn't much I can do.{nl}If it's locked, we'll have no choice but to ask Hayatin.
Did you find the document box?{nl}I'm very glad to hear that, but how exactly did you find it?
{nl}You were helped by the spirit of Victoras?{nl}Does that mean his spirit still lives?
{nl}And he's seeking the truth about the past...?{nl}I can't say I resent him entirely, given that he was simply following orders...
{nl}Very well.{nl}We need the document either way to prove Ruklys was innocent. Let us open the box, then.
The inside of the box seems intact despite the years that passed.{nl}I can only imagine what important secrets it holds.
{nl}I didn't imagine it to be locked like this. I never once tried to open it.{nl}I'm afraid we have no choice but to ask Hayatin.
A key is required to open the document box.
{nl}I held this key until the day I died.{nl}I imagine it will have remained buried with my dead body until this very day.
{nl}But I'm afraid far too long has passed and I have forgotten where my body is buried.{nl}I believe it could be at Musiz Pond, where he and I fought our last battle...
Fortunately, the document box is enchanted.{nl}It and the key will glow in each other's presence, to prevent the key from being lost.
{nl}The Blue Gosarus that inhabit these lands are said to grow magic stones in their bodies.{nl}We may be able to use their stones to activate the document box.
Obtain the magic stones from the Blue Gosarus and use the box by Musiz Pond.{nl}Should the key be buried nearby, it will react.
You've found the key.{nl}Would you open the box and have a look at the document?
The document seems intact. Indeed, it was sealed before it was buried.{nl}You may show it to Victoras and return.
It can't be...
{nl}Premier Eminent had evidence that proved Ruklys was to be suspected of treason.{nl}The fact that he enlisted in the army and built the Fortress of the Land, that is.
{nl}But this document...{nl}It's an order of the king commanding the construction of the Fortress of the Land and the deployment of defense forces!
{nl}Does this mean Ruklys followed the orders of the king, but was made to be a traitor for it?{nl}I can't imagine what King Kadumel and Premier Eminent's intentions could have been.
{nl}All I did was follow orders, and yet I, too, ended with blood on my hands...
{nl}Something needs to be settled, then.{nl}I must apologize to Hayatin.
You may go to Hayatin.{nl}I will meet you there soon.
Welcome, traveler.{nl}Did you come to tell new stories of your adventures?
{nl}Do you mean you found a document that proves Ruklys was innocent?{nl}If you don't mind, would you let me have a look at it?
Hm... The contents of this document are surprising indeed.{nl}I will report this to the Wings of Vaivora immediately.
{nl}If it is proven that Ruklys was accused of false charges, he will be named a hero once again.{nl}Your name, too, will be remembered for your great contribution to our history.
{nl}Pyromancer Master Abreh will be glad to hear about this. She has always been interested in Ruklys.{nl}If I ever compile materials on him, I'll make sure to send her a copy.
You must show this document to someone who can help spread the truth to the world.
Many of my subordinates are still possessed by the monsters.{nl}Would you free them as well?
I can still see some of their altered spirits.{nl}I'm sorry, but would you free some more?
Many spirits are now free thanks to you.{nl}May I ask you for one more favor?
Defeat the monsters surrounded by blue light and free the spirits they are possessing.
Thank you.{nl}But it seems many of my subordinates are still possessed, unaware of who they are.
I can only be grateful.{nl}All my soldiers look to have been freed now.
This is not good.{nl}If the monsters get out, who knows what terrible things they will do...
After this region suddenly lost its balance, my personal research was pushed to the background.{nl}I just wish my colleagues would bring a talented assistant from one of the big cities.
It was all our fault.{nl}That's why I want to make things right again.
No one thought a single Centaurus could change so much...
We can't let the Centaurus be.{nl}We need to take measures.
If it weren't for you, all the cities nearby would be in great danger.{nl}Thank you. I mean it.
I'm going to stay here and apply all measures necessary.{nl}I'll make sure the Moglans and Duckies stay within the region to maintain balance.
Oh, just when I thought I was hopeless, a traveler appears!{nl}I'm so glad.
{nl}Traveler, I need your help.
{nl}Three different species of monsters live in this region: Duckies, Moglans and Beetows.{nl}Among those, the Duckies and the Moglans hunt and kill each other.
{nl}If one species exterminates the other and goes beyond Khamadon Forest, it'll soon be out of control.{nl}So please, traveler, help me.
First...{nl}I should introduce myself.{nl}My name is Sophia.
{nl}I've been researching with my colleagues ways to recover from the aftermaths of Medzio Diena.{nl}Recently we found a reaction in bracken that's different from other types of vegetation.
{nl}Since then, we started to investigate different types of bracken.{nl}That's how we ended up in the depths of Khamadon Forest.
{nl}Like I said before, the Red Duckies and the Blue Moglans are at war with each other.{nl}Even though they're both dangerous species, this is the first time they venture to other regions.{nl}Them being rivals is what kept the balance of the region, you see.
{nl}But recently that balance was lost.
{nl}Red Duckies reproduce at a very fast rate.{nl}They're hunted by Ceuntaurus, however, so their population had been under control so far.
{nl}The problem started when Centaurus fell in a deep sleep and the Ducky population started to increase.{nl}They started to outnumber the Moglans, going as far as to reach beyond Khamadon Forest.
{nl}My colleagues left for the big cities nearby to warn the people there and I stayed here alone.{nl}I beg you, traveler, help me stop the Red Duckies from multiplying.
If we're going to stop the Duckies, first we need to find out as much as we can about them.{nl}The problem is my colleagues and I can't face them on our own.
{nl}But you seem strong enough. Won't you defeat a few Red Duckies and bring them over?{nl}Meanwhile I'll collect the fragments for investigation.
Thank you. I just need you to defeat a few Duckies.{nl}I'll follow after you and pick up the fragments.
{nl}I sprayed some monster repellent on myself, so don't worry.{nl}I wish I had some more... I'm really sorry.
I was able to collect a lot of samples.{nl}All thanks to you.
{nl}I'm going to study the samples and find a way to stop the Duckies.
But we can't depend on a single method to control the Duckies.
{nl}While I analyze the collected fragments, there's something I want to ask you.{nl}Can you help me a little more?
Thank you.{nl}I want to test whether destroying their nests will have any impact in reducing the population.
{nl}I'm going to give you a powerful solvent.{nl}Go to the deeper parts of the forest and use it to destroy the nests of Red Duckies.
Use the solvent at the Duckies' habitat to destroy their nests.
Good job.{nl}I also finished analyzing the fragments.{nl}But I'm afraid the results aren't exactly positive...
I ran several tests, but besides confirming that the Duckies have very high vitality, there was nothing else I could find.{nl}Destroying their nests doesn't seem to have worked either.
{nl}The more you destroy them, the more new ones appear.{nl}What can we do about this...?
That's a good idea!{nl}I think I know a way.
{nl}We found a type of brown bracken growing in Gemyn Cliff and Loba Fields called Yega Bracken.{nl}Its spores have been shown to increase the abilities of animals in previous tests.
{nl}It could very well have the same effect on Blue Moglans.{nl}I can prepare the refining process while you collect the Yega Bracken spores.
All you need to do is gather the spores of any Yega Bracken you see.
Good, good.{nl}I'm all set for the refining process too, I'll get started on the drug right away.
So I've refined the spores, but I don't know if the quantities are right.{nl}We need to test the drug in a few different ratios to be sure.
{nl}Once again, I'm going to need your help.{nl}Can I count on you?
Thank you. First I will need you to weaken the Blue Moglans to about 1/3.{nl}Then, use this sleep powder on them.
{nl}Once the Moglans are asleep, test the drugs on them and check the results.{nl}They live in the region stretching from Virszutinis Stream to Apatynis Brook.
The results were outstanding.{nl}Thanks to your help, we found the ideal mix ratio to make the Blue Moglans more powerful.
The strength enhancer for the Blue Moglans is ready.{nl}Supposedly Blue Moglans have a habit of gathering all their food in one place.
{nl}We can use that to our advantage.{nl}We just need to mix in the drug with their food.
Thank you.{nl}These are the refined spores that'll enhance the strength of the Blue Moglans.{nl}Just put this drug in the places where they gather their food.
{nl}They keep the food deep within the areas of their habitat.{nl}You can search around Apatynis Brook.
{nl}Meanwhile I'll keep looking for ways to weaken the Duckies.{nl}I'm really sorry to be asking all these favors to someone I just met, but thank you.
If we mix the refined spore drug with the Blue Moglans' food, they'll become stronger and help stop the Duckies.
Good job.{nl}Now we wait for the results.
The Moglans have definitely become stronger, but they're still outnumbered by the Duckies.{nl}Sigh... I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but I guess I have no choice.
I have to confess something to you.{nl}Everything I'm doing right now is actually to correct a mistake my colleagues and I did...
{nl}There's a reason the Centaurus is asleep.{nl}It was our fault. We didn't want it to interfere with the research so we lured it far away from here and drugged it.
{nl}But if the Duckies start spreading to the outside, we'll be in even deeper trouble.{nl}If we're going to try and stop it, we have no choice but to wake the Centaurus...
{nl}I do have something in mind.{nl}Are you familiar with Astrus herbs?
{nl}Burning these herbs releases a scent so strong people say it can wake up the dead.{nl}I think we can use these herbs to wake up the Centaurus.
{nl}I'm really sorry for all the trouble, but this is the only way.{nl}Please go to Virszutinis Stream and gather the Astrus herbs that grow there.{nl}Thank you.
I'll try and gather as much I can myself.
Thank you.{nl}If we add the amounts we gathered, we should have enough herbs to wake up the Centaurus.
You'll find the Centaurus sleeping in Loba Fields.{nl}To wake it up, burn the Astrus herbs in five places around it.
Thank you so much.{nl}Just know that it could be dangerous. It's best to hide immediately after you burn all the herbs.
Please burn the Astrus herbs around the sleeping Centaurus.
I was waiting for you!{nl}The Centaurus went running to the region where the Duckies live.
{nl}Luckily I heard it roar and was able to hide just in time.
{nl}It was acting a lot more vicious than I expected.{nl}Are you sure you used the Astrus herbs right?
{nl}It's calling our for other Centaurus now.{nl}This could make matters a lot worse.
Judging by how it went running to the Duckies, I'm sure their numbers are reduced by now.{nl}But the Centaurus is still not showing any signs of calming down...
{nl}On top of that it's even calling Centaurus from other regions.{nl}This could have serious repercussions.
{nl}I feel so sorry to you for all these mistakes.{nl}I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you for one last thing...
{nl}Please understand that you're my only hope.{nl}Will you defeat the Centaurus?
I really don't know how to thank you enough.{nl}The problem now is that I don't know how I'm going to deal with all the Red Duckies with the Centaurus gone.
{nl}I remember the Centaurus had a special way to overpower the Red Duckies.{nl}It would shine a red light from the crystal on its head to knock them out.
{nl}It's like they would be suddenly smitten by something.{nl}They can't recover from that state either...
{nl}So I'm thinking; if you can get me the crystal from the Centaurus' head I could use it to control the Duckies.{nl}I think it went to Uplink Wall. I'm counting on you.
Defeat the Centaurus in Uplink Wall.{nl}And please bring me its crystal.
I'm relieved to see you're as powerful as I thought.{nl}I'm going to study the Centaurus crystal you brought and find a way to control the Duckies.
I had thought the crystal on the Centaurus' head was a single mass, but it turned out to be made of condensed particles.{nl}So the thing smiting the Duckies wasn't light, but dust coming from the crystal.
{nl}I'm going to grind part of the crystal into a powder.{nl}Take the powder and spread it around Centrynis Field, where the Duckies are concentrating.
{nl}I want to make sure their entire habitat is affected though, so it's best if you mix the powder in with the dirt there.
I'm so sorry I keep bothering you.{nl}But if this works I can keep controlling the Ducky population with Centaurus powder.
Go to Centrynis Field and mix the powder in with the dirt there.{nl}I'll be counting on you.
Very good.{nl}I just hope this time it works.
Success!{nl}The number of new Red Ducky nests was reduced by a lot.
{nl}I've noted down the components of the crystal powder.{nl}I can't replicate it exactly, but I think I can work up something similar.
{nl}But the materials...{nl}Would you do me another favor?
{nl}I need dry bracken leaves and Blue Beetow Wings.{nl}If you bring me those materials I can make sure the Ducky population is under control for a while.
You can get the dry bracken leaves from Loba Fields.{nl}And don't forget the Blue Beetow Wings.
Thank you.{nl}I should get started on the Centaurus powder alternative now.
I feel so bad for all the trouble I put you through.{nl}We almost destroyed the natural balance of this region, my colleagues and I.
{nl}In trying to stop the vegetation problem and save the people, we put everyone in even more danger.{nl}I don't even want to think what would've happened if you weren't here.
{nl}Still, offsetting the balance of the forest was my fault...{nl}From now on I'm only going to focus on maintaining Khamadon Forest the way it is.
I have to thank you for all the help you've given me.{nl}I hope your path is blessed by the grace of the goddesses.
Hmm?{nl}I didn't realize civilians we allowed here...?
{nl}Although, if you came all the way here, you can't be just anyone, can you?
{nl}My name's Ella.{nl}I'm here on behalf of Beikeol to collect records of the Kingdom.
{nl}Would you be able to help us?{nl}We're having a bit of trouble because of the Green Goblins...
Taniel I Avenue was home to the royal library and the many bookshops that kept the ever-growing knowledge of the time.{nl}Of course, all of it was destroyed during Medzio Diena.
{nl}All the people with royal jobs who survived Medzio Diena are preparing for the restoration of the Kingdom.{nl}Beikeol is one of those people.
{nl}Beikeol is working to build a foundation for the Kingdom by recovering old records lost during Medzio Diena.{nl}That is why my assistants and I are here collecting records.
{nl}The problem is... I don't know.{nl}People are being pestered by monsters everywhere...
{nl}And I realize how important these records are, but right now aren't there more important issues?{nl}I just feel like it's a waste of manpower sometimes.
Recently we found some old parchment documents in the area.{nl}But for some reason the Green Goblins are also after those parchments.
{nl}My assistants were able to hide them inside some pots nearby but...{nl}We're having trouble going back for them because of the Green Goblins.
{nl}I was wondering if you could retrieve the parchments we hid in those pots.
You'll see the pots where we hid the documents here and there.{nl}I simply need you to retrieve the documents and bring them over.
Thank you.{nl}There really wasn't much we could do surrounded by Goblins like that.
I counted all the parchments you brought but... it seems a lot of them are still missing.{nl}I assume the Goblins must have taken them.
{nl}So I was wondering...{nl}Would you defeat the Green Goblin Wizards and get back the parchments they took?
I suspect the Green Goblins took the parchments and gave them to the Green Goblin Wizards to keep.{nl}I know it won't be easy, but please try and get the parchments from them.
Thank you.{nl}I think you've recovered all the parchments now.
I still can't help but think it's all very strange though.{nl}I wonder why the Green Goblins were so interested in those parchments.
{nl}I mean, it's not like they can even read them...
{nl}I think we should investigate the reason why they were after our documents.{nl}If anything, it could lead us to other lost parchments.
{nl}First, I want to make fake parchments to trick them.{nl}I do need chemicals for that... some contaminated tree root sap should be a good alternative.
Take this handknife.{nl}Use it to make cuts in the roots of contaminated trees and obtain their sap.
{nl}Make cuts in the tree roots with the knife to collect their sap.{nl}The sap is highly toxic though, so don't carry it for too long.
You weren't affected by the sap, were you?{nl}I knew you could do it.
With your help I finally have the fake parchments ready!{nl}It's time to go and test them on the Goblins.
{nl}If we place the fakes somewhere the Goblins can easily see them, I'm guessing they'll take them.{nl}Then, we follow them and hopefully we'll find out why they're so interested in our documents.
{nl}First, I was hoping you could set up the fake parchments for the Goblins to find.
You can put the fake parchments in place after you defeat all the Goblins around.{nl}They may not be the brightest creatures, but we can't set up the fakes with them watching.
{nl}After that, my assistants will be in charge of following them.
I have five locations in mind for this operation.{nl}First you'll need to clear out all the Goblins in each area.
{nl}We can't let them see us plant the fake parchments.{nl}Alright, I'm counting on you.
Well done.{nl}We should be receiving reports from the assistants who followed the Goblins any time now.
While we wait for the reports, may I ask you a favor?{nl}I don't feel safe with all these Goblins around.
{nl}Not only do they take our parchments, but they always end up interfering with our investigations.{nl}Can I ask you to take care of any Goblins nearby?
Thank you.{nl}You can get rid of any Green Goblins you see wandering around.
Please take care of the Green Goblins wandering around here.
Thank you.{nl}I've just received the reports from the assistants who went out to follow the Goblins that took our fake parchments.
According to them...{nl}The Goblins took the fake parchments to the roof of the library annex.
{nl}The Goblins must be doing something there.{nl}We should investigate the roof of the annex.
{nl}Although first we should stop any more documents from disappearing...{nl}If anything's causing them to disappear, I want you to take care of it.
{nl}And just let me know then.
I can't help but have a bad feeling about this.{nl}You never know when something is going to jump out at us, so be very careful.
There is definitely something happening at the roof of the library annex.{nl}Go there and investigate, but make sure you're prepared first.
I never would have guessed there was a Basilisk threatening the Green Goblins...{nl}But I guess, with their main concern gone, they should leave the parchments alone now.
{nl}I really don't know how to thank you.{nl}I'll make sure to tell Beikeol all about you and your precious help.
{nl}Also, this is from me personally.{nl}I'm trying to collect all the books I can get my hands on... so I end up with more than one copy sometimes.
{nl}This is a book about all past kings.{nl}It's an abridged version, and it was published before the 15th generation, so there's no information from the periods after that.
{nl}Still, all the important historical facts are in it.{nl}If you're interested in the history of the kingdom, I suggest you give it a read.
{nl}Alright then, I hope the the grace of the goddesses will follow you on your path.{nl}And if you meet any of my assistants, please help them in any way you can.

They want us to bring all the books we find around here but... easier said than done.{nl}I mean, how are we supposed to fight those Green Goblins?
{nl}Hey.{nl}Now that I look at you...
{nl}You seem like you could handle a few Goblins...{nl}Can you get the books for me?{nl}I'll make sure to repay you, of course.
Wow, thanks.{nl}I really owe you one.
{nl}Alright, I'm counting on you.{nl}Just check the piles of books and, if you see any with the pages still intact, bring them over.
Bring be any books you find still intact from the piles.{nl}And remember to be careful with those pesky Green Goblins.
Let me see... Not so shabby, these books you brought, huh?{nl}Our boss is gonna be happy.
You know, there was actually another group that came here before us.
{nl}But when we got here, we couldn't even find any traces of them, can you believe?{nl}Green Goblins must have wiped them out immediately.
{nl}I saw the Green Goblin Warriors and Chargers carrying their stuff around, you know?{nl}I had friends in that unit, I can tell it was their stuff.
{nl}Unfortunately I'm way too outnumbered by them to do anything.{nl}Would you do me a huge favor and get their belongings back from the Green Goblin Warriors and Chargers?
The Goblins that took my friends' things are the Warriors and the Chargers.{nl}The others weren't interested in their stuff, apparently.
Just hunt the Green Goblin Warriors and Chargers and get the things that belonged to the others.{nl}I gotta pay them respects, it's the least I can do.
You got back my friends' belongings.{nl}Shame what happened to them...
{nl}This oughta calm their spirits at least.{nl}Thanks.
Did I tell you about the other group though?{nl}There was an investigation group that came here before us.
{nl}They were a bunch of smart guys, I'm sure they found something...{nl}But with the Goblins running wild, anything they found they must have hidden somewhere.
{nl}Us investigators have a kind of saying.{nl}If something's hidden, there's always a way to find it.
Have you ever used a pendulum?{nl}This one is used only in our investigation team.
{nl}It's a magic tool that lets you find anything hidden by another investigator in a case of emergency.{nl}I was hoping you could use it to find whatever the other group hid.
The pendulum is gonna make other objects react to it.{nl}Just look through anything that shows a reaction.
A-ha...!{nl}I knew they would've hidden something.
{nl}These look like the ancient stone slates that were being stored in the library.{nl}They sure look valuable.
{nl}Thanks.{nl}I'll make sure to tell our boss you helped.
Thanks a lot. It if wasn't for you I'd still be hiding out here doing nothing...{nl}I wanna make it up to you, but I dunno... do you like books?
Take this one.{nl}It's on me.
{nl}They're Lucid Winterspoon's notes.{nl}The book's a little worn out but worth the read.
{nl}We have a few copies of this book, they won't notice if one's missing.{nl}Just don't go telling everyone I gave you the book.
{nl}Again, thanks so much for helping.{nl}I should be on my way back to camp as soon as I can.
Lucid Winterspoon's Memoranda
Some day in the year 679 of our kingdom{nl}-{nl}I had the chance to engage in conversation with Tesla recently. He told me his sculptures serve as a reminder of his own history, giving him the strength to continue living. Then, he asked if I, too, had such a record of my life.{nl}I told him not, and he advised me to create one myself. After carefully pondering Tesla's words, I have decided to follow his advice, as my sole elder in this world.{nl}That is how I came to start writing these records that I shall call my memoranda.{nl}
{nl}Some day in the year 700 of our kingdom{nl}-{nl}Rimgaudas came to consult me on a church to be constructed in Gele Plateau. He had expected me to remember an architectural style I merely saw a few times before and that has since disappeared.{nl}He looks keen on suggesting I perform time navigation. I plan on telling him that, if a church is to be built behind such secrecy, it might be wiser to create something new rather than follow an old style.{nl}He seems to favor the look of Maven's Great Cathedral, however, so I don't believe he will reconsider. Construction is planned to take 7 years. I suppose I can go and congratulate him then.{nl}
{nl}Some day in the year of 749 of our Kingdom.{nl}-{nl}After ruling for 40 years, our King Sawsel's condition looks to have deteriorated. I don't expect His Highness to survive another 2 or 3 years.{nl}The work I have completed under the wisest ruler known to history in the past decades will certainly remain as a precious memory of mine for as many years as I live.{nl}
{nl}Some day in the year of 872 of our Kingdom{nl}-{nl}Our King Nachel III's reign of half a century seems to slowly be reaching its end. I can't be certain due to the lack of records, but I don't believe a king as ever lived, or will live, to rule as long as Nachel III.{nl}While not as peaceful as the reign of Sawsel I, few are those who remember his era. Regular folk are bound to think of this as the first true period of peace in the kingdom.{nl}
{nl}Some day in the year of 876 of our Kingdom{nl}-{nl}It seems Owyn Dilven, unable to refuse our former king, has at last taken up the position of royal wizard, he who was so keen on declining the role... This ought to be the start of an interesting era.{nl}
{nl}Some day in the year of 879 of our Kingdom{nl}-{nl}Owyn came and asked me when I plan to stop living like a hermit, away from everything. Now that the royal court has caught him, he's trying to drag me with him... I was slightly taken aback, I must say.
{nl}Yet, after he begged and insisted,{nl}I did agree to donate part of the records of my achievements to the kingdom.{nl}My first donation will be this collection of memoranda. Although I can't be sure when...{nl}
{nl}Some day in the year of 884 of our Kingdom{nl}-{nl}It has come to my attention that a few young magic learners are discussing whether or not{nl}I am the greatest wizard alive.{nl}Owyn Dilven is who they think of as my closest match. He is indeed the quintessential wizard of our times, as well as the court's elite wizard. He may be almost 100 years short of practice, but his skill is enough to rival my own.
{nl}If the two of us were to battle, however,{nl}I certainly don't think he would be a match for me. But, should we continue living, that is, by using magic to lengthen our lives without dying of murder or suicide, I do believe he is bound to overpass my capacities in every sense.{nl}Although that would require another century or so to become true.{nl}The Necromancer Master is also often mentioned as our rival, but even with 100 years of training she will never outplay me.{nl}
{nl}Some day in the year of 890 of our Kingdom{nl}-{nl}Someday I wish to add something to what I've written in these records. The wizards have been discussing duels, but neither I, Owyn, nor anyone is as powerful as Agailla Flurry at the moment. And it isn't simply a question of magical power.
{nl}She is exceptionally robust, and her vision{nl}broader than anyone's. The rest of us can only look to her in reverence.{nl}A few episodes little known to the world perfectly illustrate the extension of her capacities.
{nl}There was the time she unprecedentedly came{nl}to be the successor of a goddess to fulfill the request of another divinity. Another time, she developed a plan to overthrow a demon lord's grandiose and cruel plans to hurt humanity by signing a contract.{nl}In the end, she eradicated the demon lord entirely and became the sole person, aside from the goddesses and other transcendental beings, to ever enter the Fantasy Library. This incident in itself allowed her to then thwart Giltine's plans.
{nl}In her quest to do good, she brought{nl}the goddess to the Mage Tower, and using a Demon Lord she obstructed the plans of the Demon Goddess herself. This alone should suffice to prove her greatness to the world, I believe.
{nl}Perhaps not now, but someday the entire{nl}world will know of her feats. If not these, then other, higher achievements{nl}that will further heighten the reputation of Agailla Flurry.
I am Investigator Horatio.{nl}I came after receiving orders to collect the records of Nigine Bazaar.
{nl}I believe I already collected everything worth gathering up here.{nl}It wasn't easy avoiding being sighted by the Green Goblins.
{nl}Thought I do think most of the useful records will be inside the building.{nl}Would you perhaps help me investigate the interior?
First, I'm going to need some rope to pull the books with.
{nl}The vines growing on the roof of the Lazsmo Workshop are rather sturdy and long, they ought to work.{nl}Would you gather some vines and bring them to me?
You can find the vines growing on top of the Lazsmo Workshop roof.
This should be enough to work out a rope.{nl}Thank you.
It's the first time I see a traveler here.{nl}Although, you must have your reasons to come all the way to such a dangerous place.
{nl}Myself, I received orders to search this building for royal records.{nl}I can't search the inside without some source of light, however...
{nl}I've seen the Goblin Shamans use a sort of gem before.{nl}I don't know what type of powers they have, but they seem to emit light.
{nl}I'm wondering if those gems wouldn't help me see inside the building.{nl}Would you hunt the Green Goblin Shamans and bring me their gems?
Thank you.{nl}I will be taking care of other preparations meanwhile.
{nl}Only the Green Goblin Shamans seem to carry the gems.{nl}Hunt them and bring me some of their glowing gems.
Well done.{nl}I should have nothing to worry about now.
I'm all set to start.{nl}I'll begin investigating the inside of the building now.
{nl}I wonder if you could clear out any Green Goblins nearby while I investigate.{nl}I can't risk one of them cutting my vines.
Thank you.{nl}I'll be going down now.
Thank you.{nl}A lot of materials were are kept inside as I thought.
{nl}I need to report to our chief so we can begin proper investigations inside the building.
I would never have dared to search the inside of the building without your help.{nl}I don't know how I can repay... Oh, come to think of it, there is something I can give you.
This is the tale of Barconsi and the gold vein goblin.{nl}The Kedora Alliance believes this tale is true... tricking a demon isn't that hard after all, or so it seems.
{nl}Oh, don't worry. This is only a manuscript.{nl}We're keeping the original for reporting purposes, so you can have it.
{nl}I'm very glad you accept my gift.{nl}I hope the grace of the goddesses accompanies you in your travels.
Barconsi and the Gold Vein Goblin
This story takes place in the time of King Taniel I.{nl}While never recorded as part of the history of the kingdom, this tale was passed down in documents belonging to the Kedora Merchant Alliance until 150 years ago, during the reign of King Wardel, when it became registered in the royal archives.
{nl}The story is believed to have been registered{nl}by archivists of the time under the assumption that it was merely a folktale.{nl}I, for one, would say otherwise. Thinking about this story at the time of the millenary, 50 years after the reign of King Wardel, I can't help but wonder if it isn't in fact a record of true events. 
{nl}Year 1002 of the Kingdom{nl}By Royal Recorder Dena Jonas{nl}There stood Barconsi, head of the Kedora Merchant Alliance, fearless before the enraged demon.
{nl}Ever so brazen, he confronted the demon.{nl}[I told you before and I'll tell you again.{nl}Are you so keen on disregarding the words of humans?{nl}The gold veins of this mountain belong to the Kedora Merchant Alliance.]
{nl}Rumpelstiltskin was more than bewildered{nl}by Barconsi's audacious stance.{nl}[I have lived for many, many years,{nl}but never have I seen a human so impertinent.]{nl}[What good is it, really?{nl}I am telling you the gold veins are ours.]
{nl}[I'll concede you partial rights to them{nl}as fellow explorers of the mountain. But claiming they are all yours doesn't make the slightest sense. You have no way to prove you were the first to find the gold veins.]
{nl}To this, Barconsi replied:{nl}[What you say is true, and I will not try to prove it. On the other hand, are you sure that finding something first grants you the rights to it? I can't seem to remember any such laws existing.
{nl}Furthermore, my philosophy as head of the Alliance is that the way one uses wealth is more important than how one earns it. Based on that, I believe it is only right for us to keep this gold, as we would give it the most proper use. In other words, you may have claimed the beginnings,{nl}but we will claim the end.]
{nl}[How is that anything more than absolutely groundless?]{nl}[You, my friend, are the one known for fooling others with your twisted logic. It doesn't sound{nl}like you have any authority to accuse me of groundless arguments, wouldn't you say?]
{nl}Rumpelstiltskin tried as he could to calm himself, not wanting to show any signs of backing down. A few moments passed before he took a step back and spoke.{nl}[Very well. What are your plans for the gold, then?]{nl}[I don't see a reason to tell you what we will be doing with our gold, but if you insist... What will you give me if I tell you?]{nl}[Why would I give you anything?]{nl}[I'm the head of a merchant alliance. You didn't think you could get information from me for free, did you?]
{nl}Rumpelstiltskin, for a brief moment,{nl}break the centuries-old tradition and crush this insolent human. However, his even greater love of a good fargument brought his spirit up. He in turn, welcomed such a fearless challenger in ages.{nl}[Alright, I will tell you what I would be do with the gold when I obtain the gold vein.]
{nl}At that point, Baroconsi replied.{nl}[Huh? Are you trying to purchase our gold?]{nl}[What do you mean?]{nl}[Like I have said before, you don't listen, do you? You said you will tell me what you are going to do with the gold veins when you obtain them. Obtaining implies that you are not in possession of the object. Am I right?]
{nl}What he has just heard turned his stomach around once more{nl}but decided to endure it and asked again.{nl}[These gold veins shall be used to build the walls around the capital of the Kingdom.]{nl}[Ah that plan of Taniel a human king.]
{nl}[You are correct. We will use the gold from these veins{nl}as our fund and start a business of selling supplies and building materials to the Kingdom and make profit from the practice.]{nl}[If that is your purpose, I can never let you have them.]
{nl}[If that is your answer.{nl}let's settle this through a game or a bet that you love so much.]{nl}Once the word 'game' came out, Rumpelstiltskin's eyes gleamed with interest.{nl}[A game. I admit, you got my interest. I must warn you I rarely lose in games.]
{nl}Once Baroconsi heard this. he replied.{nl}[Since you are so confident, it wouldn't matter if I choose the game right? Since you are good at everything.]{nl}[It doesn't bother me.{nl}Let's start already.]
{nl}[Okay. Let's. As for the game,{nl}how about we ask each other questions about the veins. A true owner of these veins must be able to answer without any hesitation, right?]
{nl}Rumpelstiltskin thought about the proposal for a moment.{nl}The opponent is a human who have just discovered them. There was no way a powerful demon like him{nl}could ever be beaten by an ordinary human. He accepted the proposal.{nl}[Alright. I like it. Go on.]
{nl}Once Rumpelstiltskin accepted the idea, a further discussion on some ground rules and details went on and finally they reached an agreement. One of the terms was one could ask three questions to the other. Baroconsi started his question.{nl}[How many carriages would be needed to transport all of the gold in these veins?]
{nl}A powerful demon like Rumpelstiltskin{nl}could not even begin to fathom the answer even if he had clairvoyance, he wouldn't be able to answer it.
{nl}He thought about it but after a while, he figure{nl}even Baroconsi would not answer this question so he gave up. His reasoning was{nl}if Baroconsi doesn't know the answer as well, the round is a draw.
{nl}But as soon as Rumpelstiltskin gave up, Baroconsi answered{nl}[One carriage as big as these veins would certainly carry all the gold. So the answer is one.]
{nl}This, of course, infuriated Rumpelstiltskin and protested that that was not fair.{nl}Baroconsi did not even flinch and silently started at the giant demon who can easily squahs him with a tip of his finger.
{nl}Rumpelstiltskin eventually calmed down a bit. It was not in his nature to stop a game once it started. Furthermore, he took great pleasure from defeating his opponent no matter the circumstances or conditions. So he continued.
{nl}Baroconsi asked another question{nl}[My second question is this. You and I guess the amount of gold these veins would produce in a year and the one to guess the closest wins this round.]
{nl}At the question, Rumpelstiltskin added.{nl}[This time no trick with the scales. I will not tolerate such cheap trick anymore. And if you still do, I win.]
{nl}Baroconsi stared at Rumpelstiltskin straight in the eyes.{nl}Showing no sign of fear. {nl}Even when standing before a demon with infernal flame coming out of his head and razor sharp teeth gleaming with cruelty.{nl}[I give you my word on it. No scale trick this time.]
{nl}[I wil go first this time.{nl}By human technology, the amount of gold that can be mined from these veins will be the same as the amount of 17,200 people can carry. With a margin of error of 3 people. If you say a number close to what I have just said and claim that your number is closer. I will take that as a forefeit.]
{nl}Baroconsi replied.{nl}[I am not quite sure how that would make it a win for you but it's irrelevant for I have a different number. My number is 0.]{nl}[What?]
{nl}[0. Nil. Nada. To be more precise,{nl}for next year, the veins will not yield any gold. 0 of any scale is still 0.]{nl}[That only applies if you are in charge. If I am the master, I can simply make that answer incorrect by taking a small chunk right now!]{nl}[Be my guest, if you can.]{nl}[What makes you think I can't?]
{nl}[Well, you have a habit of not listening to other people.{nl}I have already told you that the Kedora Merchant Alliance has the ownership of these gold veins{nl}and the Alliance always back its claim with evidences. Simply put we were aware of this place long before you came along.{nl}Frankly, we were waiting for you to arrive.
{nl}We have set up a barrier that no demon can ever cross{nl}The barrier will last for a year from now.{nl}That means you cannot ever touch the gold here.{nl}These facts make my guess not a guess but an accurate answer.]
{nl}[I will not have it. The second question is null.{nl}Or at least a draw.]{nl}Baroconsi did not argued with the demon's claim at all and continued.{nl}[Alright, the round is a draw. That means the next question will be a tie-breaker. I asked the questions twice in a row, so, it's only fair you do the question.]
{nl}Rumpelstiltskin was puzzled by his calm acceptance.{nl}But he did get what he wanted and it was his turn to ask. so his mind quickly became occupied with making a question. He thought about it for a moment and asked{nl}[Who will be the owner of these gold veins in one year?] 
{nl}The question was immediately followed by a stern warning from Rumpelstiltskin.{nl}[If you say the Kedora Merchant Alliance or any other person or entity, I will devour every single one of you. Of course, such task could not be done instantly.
{nl}but a year worth of time is enough. Enough to end you{nl}or any other fool who dares to claim the ownership. That fear would spread and the fools will stop. Besides, the barrier you claimed to have put will be over by then. No matter what the circumstance is the answer is absolute and only one. Isn't it?]
{nl}Rumpelstiltskin glowing with a sense of victory looked at{nl} Baroconsi. The countenance of Baroconsi did not alter at all. As if to show he has been expecting the demon's answer all along simply answered.
{nl}[The owner of the gold veins in one year's time would be you,{nl}Rumpelstiltskin.] Rumpelstiltskin was somewhat troubled by lack of disappoinment in Baroconsi's face but was joyous and said.{nl}[Yes, you admitted yourself. I am the owner of this place! So I win! Haha!]
{nl}[Not necessarily.]{nl}[What do you mean?]{nl}[I win two rounds and one was a draw. The score is 2 to nil. We won the game and we are the owner of this place.]
{nl}The demon countered. {nl}[Even if that is true, you've said it yourself, I will be the master in one year. That means, the gold veins become mine.{nl}And furthermore, you are bound by your own words that you will not be able to mine any gold from here. That means, I de facto own them.]
{nl}[Indeed. Now, let's get down to business.{nl}Literally. Let's negotiate.]{nl}[What's the meaning of this?]
{nl}[Business negotiation. We, the Kedora Merchant Alliance, will sell you{nl}this gold mine to you for a price.{nl}Name your price right, we will even disable the barrier. That could technically make the amount of gold extract more than 0, as we've previously established.{nl}The result of this game might change but that's just a simple paradox puzzle...]
{nl}Rumpelstiltskin saw the man, Baroconsi, before his very eyes{nl}talking quite vaguely about pros and cons of the deal, the method of the transaction and a simple logical solution to the simple paradox puzzle mentioned before. The demon said to himself.{nl}[Contrary to what you've said, perhaps I am too trusting of people's words.]
{nl}Not much is known how the deal went down exactly.{nl}According to one version of the story, Rumpelstiltskin paid a massive amount of silver to the Kedora Merchant Alliance and bought the gold mine. The demon did not touch the gold for he considered the deal to be his defeat.{nl}Rumpelstiltskin who has been almost unbeatable in a game or a bet had only three losses. This story was his first and the last was with Lydia Schaffen.{nl}As it is known by many, after the game with Lydia Schaffen, Rumpelstiltskin became unable to win or lose, not even participate in a game.
I'll be able to restore damaged regions like Orsha or the Thorn Forest back to normal...{nl}It might even open a path to being able to prevent a second Medzio Diena from happening.{nl}
That's why I want you to go get some red demon blood.{nl}As a recruit you can do this much, no?
Should I just join the Order of the Tree of Truth?{nl}If I did, would I be able to escape this hunger?
Don't underestimate the power of the sinister idol.{nl}Be careful.
The demons are acting quite peculiar...{nl}I worry for Goddess Dalia...
Goddess would have wanted us to stay in the cave and stay on post.
I wonder Serija is okay.{nl}Her health is not in the prestine condition, you know.
Thank you, Savior.{nl}All your hard work shall never go unnoticed.{nl}
Perhaps, Goddess Dalia is watching over us even now.
I am truly sorry.{nl}I should have kept Goddess Dalia safe.
Ah...if I had kept Goddess Dalia safe...{nl}She wouldn't have made that decision...
I cannot apologize enough for Goddess Dalia drunk with darkness.
It's no use...{nl}I can feel the darkness filling up inside me again...
Leave me alone, I beg you...{nl}I am bound to be consumed by chaos.
Remember, Savior.{nl}The one who can save Goddess Dalia is you.
You came, Savior.{nl}You've fought well for us and for Goddess Dalia.{nl}
Goddess Dalia's decision...I expected it.{nl}She did what she thought was for the best.
Do not ever forget our promise.{nl}Save Goddess Dalia.
What deliberate cruelty!{nl}They even tampered with the teleportation magic circle.
Oversight...{nl}Didn't expect a surprise attack from behind.
Who could have done this?{nl}Could it be a demon or someone with other intents?{nl}
A traveler to a place like this? Now that's a rare occasion.{nl}My name is Jaonus.{nl}I belong to a newly-formed small order to uphold the will of the goddess.
{nl}I came to this place when I heard that the refugees are in danger.{nl}I suspect the evil energy of this place.
{nl}It is the will of the goddess to wipe out the monsters and help the refugees.{nl}How about joining our order?
Good.{nl}Now, help me a bit.
We will talk more about joining our order after we take care of the evil energy here.{nl}The monsters here are not only pestering the refugees but hinder my research on the evil energy.
{nl}A clean up might be in order.{nl}Please, wipe out a horde of pags.
I am counting on you.{nl}Having them out will greatly help the purification process.
You've came back.{nl}Good work.{nl}
Hm.... you saw a ghost after cleaning up the monsters?{nl}I believe they are those who have perished by the monsters...{nl}
Poor souls.{nl}We need to stop this atrocity as quickly as possible.
Even with your help, oncoming hordes of monsters continue.{nl}They need to be wiped out so that we can purify and set up a new base of our order.{nl}
A different approach might be in order.
{nl}Inside the Room of Consciousness, there is our altar.{nl}We've built it to worship Goddess. {nl}
With the power of the altar, we can drive out those monsters.{nl}But it still lack the divine energy yet.
{nl}Could you defeat monsters and retrieve their cores? They can be used to charge up the altar.{nl}Pam Clamper's core might be ideal.
Well, there might be some relevance.{nl}Offer Pag Clamper cores, the divine energy of the altar will charge up.{nl}
Please, bring pag clamper cores from pag clampers.{nl}Again, thank you for your service.
After this mission, let's get straight to business of processing your application to the order.{nl}Pag Clamper Core, remember.
Ah...{nl}Welcome back, but...
It seems it's not enough.{nl}It's for the best to do it once and do it right. Further preparation is in order.{nl}
There is a coffin in the Hunne Memorial Room.{nl}Inside it, there are some objects. Could you get them?
Well... they are...{nl}Souls of the followers will add the divine energy to the altar.{nl}
So please, retrieve the keepsakes inside the coffin.
With this mission, we can definitely drive out the monsters away with the power of the altar.
Hmm...well done.
All set.{nl}It's all going smoothly.{nl}
Now, go to the altar and let's test it out.
Failed again...{nl}
Huh? Were are there?{nl}Never mind what just happened.{nl}
Well, I did notify other followers about you and how you wish to join us.{nl}I have some unfinished business to resolve. I believe you are needed at Tymeris Sanctuary.
{nl}A beliver called Costas will be waiting for you.
Costas
You must be the one whom Jaonus has been talking about.{nl}I am Costas.
{nl}Just a couple of things you need to do and then you are welcome to join us.{nl}Firstly, we need to gather the scattered Doctrine chapters.
{nl}Doctrine has been scattered when the monsters attacked.{nl}As you know, the recent upsurge in monsters...
Then, godspeed.{nl}This won't be too difficult.{nl}
I want to help you on the quest but I have urgent business to take care of....{nl}Just retrieve non-damaged ones, please.
They are scattered around.{nl}Some might have been torn up by monsters.
You've found all the important sections of Doctrine.{nl}
{nl}Ah, this one is far too damaged. There is no need for it.{nl}Thank you for you hard work.
All we need to do now is,{nl}light up a campfires that detects and purify the evil energy at in Nagyt Stone Room.
{nl}We set up the place, so all that is left is oil to keep the holy fire burning.
{nl}As for the oil, Blue Pag Dopers near the room.{nl}Please, gather the oil from them and light the campfires.
There aren't that many of the campfires so securing the oil is the main task.
I need to finish up inscribing on the wall...
Thank you so much.{nl}Now, you are part of the order!
There is an order that worships Goddess at Tymeris Temple?{nl}Never heard of them.
{nl}That so-called Doctrine is... blasphemous.{nl}All those heretics, ever since the disappearance of Goddess.
{nl}Take that Doctrine to Judge Rymis in Fedimian suburbs.{nl}He will know something about this "order."
Welcome, what brought you to this place, my child?
{nl}Ah..{nl}The Priest Master sent you to me.
Based on what I have read from that Doctrine. It is certainly not orthodox.{nl}Please, make haste and consult with Rymis.
{nl}Rymis is in Fedimian Suburbs.
The writings are partially unintelligible but what I can make out are phrases like Giltine...Death....Praise.{nl}They certainly are not normal order that worship Goddess. 
Welcome back.{nl}
Book of Judgement, when seen, running away is the usual response.
Well done.{nl}Failure would certainly slow them down.{nl}
On that day,  the Order of the Tree of Truth problem will be solved and I will deal with this myself.{nl}Thank you for your service.
My friends all seem to have fallen asleep, no one is responding{nl}It wasn't a monster attack, was it?
A suspicious group of heretics in Tymeris Temple...
{nl}So, this is their Doctrine, eh?{nl}Heavily damaged but some parts are intelligible.
{nl}I did hear there was a group that broke away from the Order of the Tree of Truth.{nl}They were said to be too radical even for the Order of the Tree of Truth. When I said they 'broke away' it was more like 'they were casted out'
{nl}They are trying to set up a headquarter that.{nl}But I cannot leave this place because of the whole Order of the Tree of Truth business...
Please, reform those heretics.{nl}Take this book with you.{nl}
They are fairly new. There won't be that many people.{nl}The book reacts to the heretics that refuse to be reformed. It will guide you in your task.{nl}
May Goddess watch over your path.
Doctrine is far too damaged.
Something is covering the page, rendering it unreadable.
The ink is smudged.
Something written on the wall.
What are these souls?{nl}What happened, here?
What chaos...
{nl}Oh hello.{nl}My name is Hilda.{nl}I somehow survived and came to be here.
{nl}Could...could you help us?{nl}There are two cupoles, not a day go by without their constant bickering with each other.
{nl}There is nothing we could to about it and we are looking for someone to help us on this.{nl}Could you either make them be friends with each other or resolve the conflict?
You would do that for us? Oh thank you so much.{nl}The cupoles can be see at Dvynai Hills.{nl}
I trust you would do a great job.{nl}We don't know what they would do and when.
A traveler to this place? That is something rare.{nl}I am Lina.{nl}I am in charge of leading souls.
{nl}Ever since Medzio Diena, the autumn leaves are not as they seem.{nl}Usually, the autumn leaves represent hope of new leaves and the well-deserved rest.
{nl}However, these autumn leaves have stopped growing and went into eternal dying.{nl}I have been searching for a way to bring life back to those trees.
{nl}This, I believe, is for the best.
I am in charge of providing trees with supplements.
{nl}Why am I not using the Kupole power? I alone cannot
{nl}Thank you for volunteering to help us.{nl}To get what we need to craft, obtaining Nutta Fluid from Nuttafly and Nuttabug would be in order.
The forest is far too big for me to do it alone.
That was quite quick.{nl}Thank you so much for your service.{nl}
That seems to be sufficient.
Now, could you gather up the leaves that will be used as main ingredients for making the supplement?{nl}The piles of leaves can be easily found at Netting Hills.
Those leaves combined with the fluid you've brought can be mixed and make the supplement.
Please, be safe.{nl}I will prepare the rest.
Making the supplements is not hard, at least I have gotten used to it but gathering materials on the other hand.
That seems to be enough leaves.{nl}Please, wait a moment.{nl}
I will mix the leaves with the processed materials to make the supplements.
The supplements are all ready.{nl}Could you get these to Popot Stream?{nl}
There, you will find a bottle that I have set up.{nl}Just fill it in with the supplement.{nl}
I will await for your triumphant return.
A traveler? What business would you have with me?{nl}Why I broke the bottle?{nl}Well these should not be here!
{nl}I don't know why Lina keeps trying to reverse the path of nature?{nl}The leaves keep the plants down. Reviving them will unleash the plants.
{nl}Who is going to deal with that, eh?
You think so too, right?{nl}
I just don't understand.
Just for a moment, I was away. She creates more mess.{nl}What am I going to do with her.
So you've met Aeglei?{nl}Did he break the bottles again, I presume.
{nl}Aeglei says that I will unleash the plant outbreak but if we leave it alone, it won't be just leaves.{nl}Every single plant life will fall as if it is in the middle of particularly harsh Winter.
{nl}I must protest Aeglei's thoughtless action.{nl}I just don't understand.
{nl}But thanks anyway.{nl}If you don't want to be involved with the whole Aeglei and I situation, you can stop helping me.
You came back?{nl}
You want to help me?{nl}
What are you really up to?{nl}I don't need your help.
I saw you helping Lina, why don't you go back to her?
You're still here?
Alright, if ya really wanna help, drive away nearby monsters.{nl}They pester me while I am fixing the mess left by Lina.{nl}
If you can't, go back to Lina.
I got my hands full fixing her mess.{nl}But if not me, who will?
What? You really drove them off?
You are serious, aren't you?{nl}If that is the case, let me ask you a favor.
{nl}Lina has messed around with this place quite a bit and I cannot do it alone.{nl}Please, check up on Bethez and Tjibes Refuges and see if any more of Lina's business is there.
She sent you here that must mean she did something here.
When will I ever stop cleaning up after her.{nl}So frustrating.
Ah welcome back.{nl}Hmm... nothing suspicious was found, eh.{nl}
Well, thank you for checking up on them.
Ah, this is a communication device to communicate with other kupoles while out staying here tending the forest.
Jaonus disappeared without any answer.{nl}Let's go to the Consciousness Room, he talked about.
This supplement bottle is full.{nl}Let's find another one.
Aeglei and Lina still constantly bicker with each other but neither the autumn leaves nor plant outbreaks are happening anywhere.{nl}As if the forest has found an equilibrium.
There is no sign of Lina's devices.
I thought regularly injecting the trees with supplements will revive the dying autumn leaves.
In the name of Thomas Iquinostasys, the day of judgement upon all the heretic will come.
The forest is dying.{nl}The autumn leaves are the proofs.{nl}We must save the trees.
I cannot thank you enough.{nl}Thanks to you, we have found a way to keep the forest's equilibrium.
I will maintain it along with Aeglei and keep the townspeople away from harm.
You feel strange.
Ha...I just cannot understand Lina.{nl}Plant outbreaks will put all of the townspeople in danger.{nl}
Her heart is in the right place, I admit but she doesn't have any foresight.
A travel, I see.{nl}Welcome.{nl}
I am Brunonas a forest keeper.{nl}I came here to help Chronomancer Ida on investigating the autumn leaves phenomenon in this area.{nl}
I mean, my life as a forest keeper made me curious also.{nl}So I asked the woodsmen and herbalists nearby to help our investigation.{nl}
From what I know, the whole thing started after Medzio Diena.{nl}Ida thinks it goes further than that.
{nl}I don't know why she would think like that.{nl}If you are so keen to find out, how about helping me?
Good to hear.{nl}I am a mission from Ida to check up on Raffye Crossroads among other things.
While I take care of the other tasks, could you go and check up on Raffye Crossroads for me?{nl}You might have to defend yourself on your way there from the monster, though.
Come back to me, after you check it out.
You came back.{nl}Did the monsters give you any trouble?{nl}
Ah yes.{nl}The autumn leaves themselves display nothing unusual.
{nl}The same goes for the ones I have search as well.
If possible, could I ask you one more favor?{nl}You might have seen some patches of moss on Raffye Trail.{nl}
They are hidden behind the rocks, I presume.{nl}Could you grab some samples for me?
Thanks.{nl}Now, I need to write down what I have found here for Ida.
{nl}Ida asked for the findings in a report form.{nl}If I can just determine the type of moss, I can send this in right away. So, could you please gather some moss samples?
I will be finishing up my report.{nl}Thank you for doing this for me.
Ah, you've came back.{nl}Let me see.
{nl}Hmm, these are Blue Nheto Moss. The kind only grows in autumn.{nl}Just as I thought.
{nl}Then, here is the report Ida asked me to write.
{nl}On your way to Ida, could you retrieve the reports from the aforementioned woodsman and herbalist?
{nl}Ida will tell you about a thing or two regarding the cause, when she get these reports.{nl}After that, could you bring them back to me as well?
Brunonas told me to go?
{nl}As you heard, I am doing what Brunonas asked me to do.{nl}That is also Ida's request.
{nl}As for me, I cannot refuse such request.{nl}My livelihood is in jeopardy with this prolonged autumn, after all.
{nl}I just need a couple more of herbs.
You will help me?{nl}Now, that's really good news.{nl}
The tricky ones, I will handle them. So, all you have to do is get some yellow Lyciu Herbrs at Pjama Resting Place.{nl}Just finding something yellow in middle of red would not be that difficult.
Lyciu Herbs.{nl}Their yellow color do make them stand out.{nl}
LI wish you all the good luck.
You've got them alright.{nl}That seems to be enough.
Now, just one for thing and we are done here.{nl}I would have to finish up my report so could you get them for me?
For naked human eyes, they are hard to find. But with the help of Iyran.{nl}It's not too bad.
Vhelis is a root of some sort. Not leavess, nor flowers. Roots.{nl}It has a distinctive scent but undetectable by humans.
{nl}Let Iyran works its magic.{nl}If he doesn't follow you, use this whistle. This'll bring call him.
Iyran is smart and he will let you know straight away.{nl}And you can call it straight away via the whistle.
Iyran is a smart boy, isn't he?{nl}Of course, he is. Look at the amount he got.
Now. Let me just finish the report.{nl}
Here you go. All done.{nl}like Brunonas said go to the woodsmans and he will give you the other report.{nl}Godspeed.
Ah, you are here for the report, aren't you?{nl}I did hear it from Brunonas but...{nl}
Recently, chopping down the trees have been booming. And I cannot keep up the demand.{nl}That slowed me down a bit.
If the matter is that urgent, could you help me?
Well, with you on my team, I feel relieved.{nl}Go to the Kunck Logging Area and you will find the piles of woods I have made.
{nl}Just check up on them, would ya?
Just make sure the piles of firewood are okay.
Ah, well come back.{nl}Huh? Strange powder?
{nl}Those are from me. mushroom spores.{nl}The dry atmosphere dried them up quickly.
{nl}It certainly is a good day to chop woods.{nl}Not so much for growing mushrooms though.
I will be finishing up my report for Ida.{nl}So, could you do the check up for me?
Lately, there have been some strange incidents, though.{nl}Like trees with strange rings. 
On Yvass Hill, please check the rings of trees.
Just have a glance at them would be enough.
I have been a lumberjack for quite a long time.{nl}I will put it in my report.
How were the tree rings?{nl}As I expected, none at the outer region right?
{nl}Just as I thought.{nl}Now, take this report.{nl}Along with the other report, take them to Ida.
You have already checked this pile.
What do I owe the pleasure?{nl}Ah, the reports from Cesaris, Dowedas and Brunonas/{nl}Thanks for all your trouble.
{nl}I am Ida an apprentice to the Chronomancer Master.{nl}The Master has requested me to investigate the autumn leave anomaly.
{nl}I have already asked the nearby native workers here.{nl}The refuges are not all that familiar with the anomaly after all.
{nl}Hmmm like what the master has expected.{nl}If possible, could you help me on a couple of experiments?
Firstly, could you retrieve some blood samples from the monster?{nl}I need to test my master's theory.
Then, I will leave the blood samples up to you.
That was rather fast.{nl}Now, show me the blood samples.
That is more than enough for the experiment.
The blood is not going through clotting. As I have expected.{nl}Under normal circumstances, they should have been clotted quickly.
{nl}The master said that Medzio Diena is not the sole cause of the autumn leave anomaly.{nl}The axis of time itself is broken.
{nl}Only one last thing to check.
Take this bloom sample and go to a place outside the autumn leaves forest.{nl}If it gets clotted, then verification is complete.
{nl}Could you take this sample at get to Outer Wall District 8?{nl}That is the nearest exit after all.
How did the blood samples react?
Just as we expected.{nl}The master was right.
{nl}This proves that the time itself is broken and this place is frozen at autumn. 
{nl}The flow of time is broken and autumn continues.{nl}In other areas, the plant growths have experienced anomalies on their own.
{nl}That means that Medzio Diena did not only affect the plant growths but also the flow of time itself.{nl}As a proof, the autumn leaves persist in this area.
{nl}I should finish up the report.{nl}One last favor to ask of you. Could you give the report to my master?
Thank you so much.{nl}I have some more tasks left for me here.
Just let my master know of the report.
The report will do the talking.
Ah, what seems to be the matter?{nl}
You came in Ida's stead?{nl}So the results, how were they?
Just as I expected. Medzio Diena is not the direct cause after all.{nl}The passage of time in that specific region is experiencing a some sort of freezing.
{nl}Medzio Diena not only caused the overgrowth of the plants but also the time itself.{nl}The problem is limited to that specific area though.
What did Ida think of all this?
Ah, she as well?{nl}The time of autumn is frozen.
I hope the Chronomancer Master and Ida sort this whole thing out.{nl}Autumn is killing the forest.
Thank you for letting me know.
Monsters using the divine energy... I cannot begin to understand but I am to do as told.
Ah, a traveler I see.{nl}My name is Morkus.
{nl}I represent all the good people who have settled down here after Medzio Diena.{nl}What worries me is that the soldiers with whom we have been together so far have disappeared. And we are currently investigating their whereabouts.
{nl}The soldiers are the family of the refuges.{nl}Even my brother is one of them. Fortunately, the journal he left is the clue at the moment.
{nl}I came here cause I heard the soldiers were stationed here.{nl}The journal contains some clues but it is difficult for me to move about.
Thank you for doing this for us.
{nl}We are about to despair because we did not have any help.{nl}Some are even on the brink of madness. Worried sick about their friends and families' whereabouts.
Head Villager Morkus
Then, let's look at the jounral for clues.
Where did all the soldiers go?
How can I even begin to relay the news to the villagers?!
One of the early entries say this.{nl}
This is madness. Autumn leaves don't grow back even if you paint them green.
It seems that they were trying to make the leaves green again by painting them.{nl}I will give you the organic solvent to verify this. Could you check them for me?
{nl}If only, the leaves regain their true color...
If the journal is accurate, something happened to the soldiers during the mission.{nl}If painting the leaves green is indeed true.
I will pray for you.
Whatever happened to the soldiers?
The leaves were indeed painted green!{nl}That verifies the conent of the journal.
According to the jounral's other entries, it talks of a tree with all the leaves fallen out.
Now, they are stitching the leaves back on the tree.
Going insane... or perhaps already have.
The state of soldiers is exacerbating.{nl}Cursed or affected by something?{nl}
Please, let me know if the claim is true.{nl}If you come across a strange looking tree. Give it a shake...
{nl}Now, the leaves didn't flutter, eh? The journal must be telling the truth.
The soldiers must have been in a terrible situation.
I pray they are safe.
The leaves stayed on?{nl}As if they were sewn?
{nl}The contents of the journal are true...
{nl}The soldiers have become irreparably strange.
There is no way of knowing now.
It's getting worse. 
Not just sewing the leaves but making a ragdoll and ripping them apart? That is not normal by any standard.
What if the people get harmed?
The last entry on the journal.{nl}I have searched the vicinity but have not found the ragdoll it speak of.
That must be the last trace...{nl}Could other traces be erased by the monsters?
The nearby monsters might have something on them. Could you check them out?
I cannot do it myself due to the injury.{nl}I am truly sorry but could you check them out for me?
If the traces were not erased by the monsters that means we don't have any leads.{nl}Where to start.
That ragdoll!{nl}Did you get it from the monster?
Thank you so much for your hard work.{nl}Based on the journal, the soldiers were slowly going mad.
What happened to them...
Ah, I did find a necklace while searching.{nl}The soldiers did say there was a mysterious man. Perhaps it belongs to him.
{nl}Evne a small clue is a big help. {nl}I will tell the others what we found here. Could you look for that mysterious man?
Thank you.{nl}Here is the necklace.
I hope, this time, we get to find out what happened to those soldiers.{nl}Not knowing what happened to one's own family is devastating.
{nl}I will go to the soldiers' base camp and find something else.
{nl}Even with my injury, it is not that far off. I can reach it.
I haven't seen you around here before.{nl}What can I do for you?
You've got my necklace!{nl}That thing will call out monsters.
You must have been through a lot to get here.{nl}I offer my sinceresy apology.
I was actually looking for it myself.{nl}But how did you know it belong to me in the first place?
Ah, you've met the representative.{nl}You must be searching for what happened to the soldiers.
Hm..{nl}
They are not just done.{nl}In fact, I lead them to somewhere else.
The minds and bodies of those soldiers were broken.{nl}In their conditions, the forest's anomaly would have only caused further problems for them.
I could not risk infecting other villagers nor allowing something horrible happening to them by the soldiers.{nl}I had no choice but to lead them to a different place.
{nl}It is better than risking everyone...{nl}I am truly sorry but I cannot tell you where they are for now.
I am fully aware of the fact that some of the soldiers are from the families of the refuges but...{nl}I did what I had to do.
I take the full responsibilities and resentments from the refuges. Even their curses.{nl}If you want to know the whereabouts of the soldiers. Please, deliver this fact to them.
Even though, it had to be done. The guilt, I still feel.{nl}I am a human being. I do know the pain of losing a family.
The soldiers have already gone mad...?{nl}And the man took them to somewhere else?
{nl}... do you expect me to deliver such news to the village?{nl}To those who could not eat or sleep because they are worried sick about their families?
Please, let the others know.{nl}I am sorry for giving you such a burden.
Th-thank you.
I followed my mummy and daddy here.{nl}But I cannot find my daddy so I came out looking for him.
My dad is a soldier. He didn't return home one day.{nl}A man said if I make thousand leaf whistles, Goddess Zemyna will grant my wish.{nl}
So, I got out to make leaf whistles.{nl}But once I came here the monsters scared me.
{nl}Umm... could you help me make a whistle?
Please, I need plant roots for my whistles.
I did bring a shovel with me but the roots are far too sturdy for me do get them.{nl}I have heard the paringhetti resting place has a lot of them underground.
Again, thank you so much!
Thank you so much.{nl}These seem to be more than enough!
My daddy will return when I offer thousand leaf whistles I make, right?{nl}The man said so.
When will daddy come home.
It's better than nothing. Let's hold on to this damaged Doctrine.
When will we be able to complete the altar and worship the glory.
A traveler?{nl}It's too dangerous here. I urge you to leave.
I knew you are no ordinary one.{nl}If you are truly the savior, please, help me.
{nl}Recently, strong-looking demons have emerged around here.{nl}Perhaps they came here looking for the thing like I am.
{nl}The thing I am looking for is in fact, the trace of Goddess.{nl}I am looking for the traces left by Goddess Ausrine.
{nl}We need to find the traces before the demons do.{nl}If we ever want to know the whereabouts of Goddess Ausrine.
We need to be absolutely sure if what the demons are doing is related to Goddess.
{nl}I have seen a demon ordering his subordinates a while back. An elder demon, I presume.
{nl}There must be written orders or documents regarding the order.{nl}Could you check if the demons might have something of that kind?
You probably won't be able to read the demon language.{nl}If you find them, just bring them back to me.
I will decipher them.
Of course, there was an written order.{nl}I will read it through.
Stone fragments are here. Now to make a detector orb, the demon energy is required.{nl}You seem surprised.
{nl}I can put my divine energy and find the objects related to Goddess.{nl}But we need the demon energy to activate the orb in the first place.
{nl}I am the only one here so, my divine energy is not enough to power them both. That is why we need the demon energy.
I will make the detector orb.{nl}Defeat monsters while carrying this will absorb the demon energy.
The crystal will glow when it's full.{nl}I will pray for your safe and triumph return.
Ah, well done.{nl}This will be enough to activate the orb.
Now, let me thoroughly look at the written orders you have secrued.{nl}While I examine this, there are things I want you to get for me.
{nl}I am more than convinced that Ausrine's traces are the same thing as the demons are seeking.{nl}That is why I will make a detector orb that can sense the faint energy Ausrine left behind.
{nl}Please, get me those materials.
Jeromel Square is the place blessed by the goddess.{nl}That is why even a stone fragment is blessed with the power of the goddess.
{nl}They are easy to acquire so perfect for our use.{nl}Please, get them for me.
Just look around the goddess statue in Jeromal Square.{nl}I will be reading through the orders while you do that.
{nl}With you helping me, it is going so smoothly.
Well done.{nl}These will be enough.
Thank you so much for retrieving them!
You've found a new order?{nl}Let me have a look.{nl}
I think it's only a bit different from the previous one.{nl}It says that it should be retrieved from Diena instead of Demon Queen Gesti.{nl}
Ah, that must be that demon I saw. Diena.{nl}Hmm, Diena...
A Demon King, not a Demon Lord. Hmmm...
I have just finished reading through them.{nl}Just as I thought, they are searching for the traces of Goddess Ausrine.
{nl}And... the one who ordered is Gesti, the Demon Queen.{nl}It is no surprise since from the demon perspective, such is quite important.
{nl}it says if any of them find something resembling a trace, bring it straight to Gesti.{nl}Three places are mentioned on the orders. Let's start with the nearest one.
Park Residential Area is the closest among the three places.
I will be inspecting the movment of the demons at different place.{nl}Use the divine energy detector orb near the Park Residential Area.
Please, get to Jeromel Park Residential Area and please hurry.{nl}We must find the trace of Goddess Ausrine.
What you have retrieved is indeed the trace of Ausrine.{nl}That is why the demons attacked.
{nl}Now, let's see.{nl}At first glance, it looks like a part of a device. I will hold on to it.
{nl}No time to waste.
I have seen the demons rushing to Jeromel Park Management Office.{nl}Could you get there as soon as possible?
We know they are after the traces of Ausrine.{nl}We must now find out why.
{nl}If we beat them to the punch. We will know why as well.{nl}Also, we will get a glimpse of why Ausrine did what and why.
I am really sorry to rush you.{nl}But we must find the trace before the demons do.
Ah, this time the demons got their hands on it first.
{nl}It is quite disappointing but there is no point crying over split milk. Then we must get the other one.{nl}We must hurry.
The only place left is Shopping Street Entrance.{nl}Please, inspect the Shopping street.
They also have lost one so the fight won't be easy.{nl}So be very careful.
Please, be safe.{nl}I am very grateful for your help. It really sped things up.
{nl}We will soon find the whereabouts of Goddess Ausrine as well.
Prepare for the strong demons.
I have inspected the traces you have found.{nl}Not counting the one taken by the demon, of course.
{nl}They are parts of a device that is designed to control some sort of energy.{nl}We need to find more traces to be sure.
{nl}The divine energy detector orb has ran out of its juice. It needs recharging.{nl}Just like what you did when we were making it. Fill it up with the demon energy.
Deadborn you've just defeated must have exuded the magic around it when it died.{nl}I am pretty sure the spell is still there.
{nl}It's much faster this way.{nl}I will keep an eye on the demons.
The next stop, Jonael Memorial.{nl}Let's get prepared and get to it.
You've came back rather quickly.{nl}It seems that this time it will last longer.
The outbreak of plants at Jonael Memorial was rather severe than most places.{nl}On top of that, the demons will not take this lying down. They will attack with full force.
I will be waiting for you there.{nl}As soon as you are ready, please, follow me.
You've came.{nl}Let's find the trace quick.
By the time I got here, the demons were heading towards Jonael Memorial.{nl}That's where we need to go.
{nl}The path leading there will be infested with the demons.{nl}Be safe and defeat them.
Defeating the monsters along the way would be wise.{nl}Now, please head towards Jonael Memorial.
Clearing the path to Jonael Memorial would be in order.
We cannot do this any more.{nl}Please, get to the memorial first.
While you are removing the magic circles, I have been grasping the movements of the demons.{nl}Then suddenly, they all headed towards Jonael Hall.
{nl}They probably lured us in by setting up those magic circles and try to beat us to the punch.{nl}Be haste and go to the Hall.
I am counting on you again to retrieve the trace.{nl}We need more than two traces.
{nl}I will be on the look out for the demons.{nl}I need to monitor them carefully.
Thank you doing this.{nl}We must get those traces of Goddess Ausrine before the demons do.
What happened to the trace?
{nl}Nummer.{nl}Now the score is even.
{nl}With these only, I cannot figure out the whereabouts of Goddess Ausrine.
All done.{nl}Next stop, the residential area.
The evil magic is exuding nearby. But no worries, the divine energy detector orb will work.
Godspeed.{nl}I will pray hard for your safe and triumphant return.
Not much is known about Demon Lord Diena.{nl}My guess is that Diena is a silent and obedient type. It's only my guess, though.
{nl}But Diena do work for Gesti directly.{nl}Be careful.
I have examined the traces.{nl}I do have a hunch but too early to tell.
{nl}I am terribly sorry but could you investigate the rubbles in the area?{nl}The fragments of processed stones or the altar might be there.
Please, investigate the rubbles.{nl}The rubbles in Jonael Memorial the area where the trace was found. They are the ones.
{nl}I need more rubbles to turn my conjecture into conviction.
If my expectation does not betray me...{nl}Something astounding happened even before Medzio Diena.
Have you find something from the rubbles?{nl}
You retrieved them.{nl}Let me examine them.
These fragments...I knew it.{nl}
Yes, these are indeed from the altar of Goddess Ausrine.
She arrived here right before Medzio Diena.{nl}If I am remembering correctly, she began her journey here shortly before Medzio Diena.
{nl}The traces are from different objects.{nl}Ritual devices or fragments of the altar.
{nl}Regardless, they are related to the altar.{nl}These traces not only contain her power but also faint energy of the Divine Tree.
{nl}Just as I thought, Goddess Ausrine has built altars at five different places.{nl}She used her divine energy and these ritual tools to set up a barrier.
{nl}When Medzio Diena occurred, she like all the other goddesses, lost her power.{nl}But the barrier she set up drew its power away from the Divine Tree.
{nl}Transferring the energy gained back to Goddess Ausrine.{nl}That probably... no certainly made it possible to retain her power.
{nl}That is why the demons were seeking these traces so badly.
{nl}Thank you so much.{nl}Without your help. these truths never have been discovered.
{nl}We cannot fully determine her location but...{nl}This news will certainly appease other goddesses.
The important fact is that Goddess Ausrine retained her power. But still her whereabouts is a mystery.{nl}Further investigation of this area might yield some results.
{nl}If the clues are here, the demons will continue to swarm in.{nl}I am fully aware that you have done so immensely for me but could you help me a bit further?
{nl}If we set up an alarming device, we will be able to detect the demons immediately.
If then, could you get some of demon energy?{nl}I need to make the device that can recognize the energy pattern and sound the alarm.
{nl}I do have the crystal but I need the demon energy to calibrate.{nl}Oh the task wouldn't be that difficult for you, Savior.
{nl}Attack and stun ragbirds and ragged butchers and absorb their energies.
When the demons are weakened, seal their power.{nl}I will, like always, await your triumphant and victorious return.
That seems to be enough.{nl}I will put them into the alarm crystal right away.
Thanks to you, the alarm crystal is complete.{nl}And it works beautifully.
Now, all that is left is installing it at the sight of the traces.{nl}Just placing it would do the trick.
There are still some demons left around here, so please be careful.{nl}The crystal itself has a barrier of its own but it activates after its initial installation.{nl}
Before you install this, wipe out the vicinity.{nl}After that merely placing it will work itself.
I will examine further into the traces.{nl}Also, I will see if the alarm gets here without a problem.
Thank you so much for your hard work.{nl}I pray we could get some information on her.
But at least knowing the fact that she has retained her powers is a great discovery.{nl}The all matter involving Demon Lord Diena does trouble me but it's not our top priority for now.
{nl}I pray your path is blessed by Goddess.
Huh?{nl}I'm sorry, that was unexpected.
{nl}A fairy turning into Demon King, that is astounding.{nl}What is even more astounding is regaining its memory and co-operating with us.
{nl}And Diena was dragged away by  Rexipher?{nl}I sense an struggle and conflict inside the demon force.
{nl}But thanks heavens for retrieving all the traces of Goddess Ausrine.{nl}These will help our investigation on the whereabouts of her.
I firmly believe that if we keep examine these traces, we will one day find her.{nl}Even if we don't, it is worth fighting for.
Are you saying that they are having an arguement between themselves?{nl}A demon that has issues with Gesti...{nl}
What do you think could have happened?{nl}Do you think this has anything to do with it?
We need to find the traces quickly.{nl}The demons have set up magic circles at the central square.
They interfere with the divine energy detector orb.{nl}We need to disable them.
The interference magic circles are makeshifts.{nl}You can probably disable them just by stepping on them.
We must retrieve the traces of Goddess Ausrine before they fall into the hands of the demons.{nl}We must hurry.
You've returned!{nl}Wait, something not right.
The contents of the orders and the general vibe from the demons spell some inner conflicts.
{nl}But at the moment, the most important task is retrieval of the traces.{nl}The demons did take away the trace in the hall, after all.{nl}
According to the document, there are five traces in total.{nl}We must get the remaining ones.
One of the places mentioned is Jonael Residential area.{nl}The area certainly exudes a great amount of the divine energy. But unfortunately, the evil energy as well.
Demon Lord Diena might be around.{nl}I will prepare for the worst. There might be more of those interference magic circles.
I will enhance the divine energy detector orb so that it won't get affected by the interferences and{nl}make you undetectable by a Demon Lord.
{nl}If possible, please, get me some of the fragments of the interference magic circles that you've disabled?{nl}I will use them to enchant the orb.
{nl}The magic stone fragments can be obtained from ragbirds and ragged butchers.
Please, be quick.{nl}We haven't got much time on our hands.
You've gotten them all!{nl}Yes, yes. They are more than enough.
You are now well trained enough to shoot the oncoming enemy fast and precise.{nl}My, you really have grown, haven't ya?{nl}
Before I let you in on the last set of skills, you need to prove how much you have grown.{nl}If what I see in you is true, it won't be difficult.
Some of companions for our mercenary group have fallen ill.{nl}From what we know, the Hackapell Master is the person to visit.
{nl}But the medicine supply is not abundant. And we got left out.
{nl}As luck would have it, the Pardoner Master said there was some debt between them and if you help the Pardoner Master.{nl}The cure is secured.
{nl}It's a bit unnerving but the most important aspect of being a Schwazer Reiter is mobiliuty derived from our trusty companions.{nl}At the moment, the group needs some mediating, so, I cannot go myself.
{nl}It would be great if you can carry out the Pardoner Master's request.{nl}The task is not too daunting and it would be a great opportunity for you to prove your strength.
{nl}I did hear that there are some drifted onto Cranto Coast, Igti Coast and Vera Coast.{nl}The coins were found but most of them were taken by the monsters.
{nl}The Pardoner Master wants you to retrieve the old commemorative coins.{nl}10 of them would be enough.
On Igti Coast, the biggest drifter has been found.{nl}Incidentally, it is the most difficult places of all three. So, the choice is yours.{nl}
Let us not waste time, we cannot let our companions suffer anymore.{nl}Besides, speed is the life of a mercenary, after all.
Excellent!{nl}You are earlier than I expected.
I must approve of your strength.
I don't doubt you will do great hunting along with your partner.
Go to Khonot Forest and you will find a giant monster called Gosal. Defeat it and get its horn.{nl}It will not be too difficult for you and your partner.
Now, that is impressive.{nl}That is why I will teach you the high end skills.{nl}
Prove that how well you can handle your hawk to me.{nl}Are you ready?
The target is Gosal of Khonot Forest.{nl}It is a giant bull-like monster.{nl}
Get his horn.
How did it go?{nl}
Hmm... this is Gosal Horn.{nl}I never doubted you.
Now, let the final lesson begin.
Ah, there you are.{nl}You are just in time. I have a favor to ask of you.
I have received a request but I am frankly overwhelmed by other tasks.{nl}I was searching through the suitable candiates for the job and your name came up.
I have complete faith in you.{nl}But don't let the monsters surround you.
Like always, you did not betray my faith in you!{nl}
Hard work must be compensated, right?{nl}I will teach you new skills of a cannoneer.
Are you interested in the combat skills of a hackapell?
{nl}We charge straight to the front line along with our companions.{nl}Our path is somewhat different from that of other archers who support the team from behind.
{nl}But first I must test whether you have got what it takes.{nl}So I am currently working on the request from the Pardoner Master.
{nl}So, could you help me concentrate on that task by taking care of the rest?{nl}From what I see, it would be a great opportunity for you to prove yourself.
On Grynas Hills, you will find an old sanctuary.{nl}Now, it is a training ground for Dievdirbys. The forest energy will gather up around the sanctuary.
{nl}While you are busy filling up the forest energy, I will take care of the Pardoner Master's request.{nl}The task involving the forest energy itself is not difficult but I have got too many at hands.
{nl}Moreover, nowadays the monsters in the forest have gone feral. A perfect opportunity to prove yourself, isn't it?{nl}Here, take this crystal and fill it up with the forest energy.
You are wondering about what does the crystal have to do with the Pardoner's request , aren't you?{nl}Well, let me tell you firstly about the purpose of the crystal.{nl}
The forest energy boosts up the companion medicine's performance.{nl}Well, even without the boost, I only make the best in the kingdom.{nl}
I am counting on you on the matter regarding the crystal.{nl}Please, don't slack off.
Do it for the companions. Please do the best.
You've filled it up.{nl}Now onto the subject of your compensation.{nl}
I will teach you the combat skills of a hackapell.{nl}For you at the moment, that is on your mind, I presume.
Mergen Master
Do you wish to learn the archery of a mergen?
{nl}A mergen proves through archery.{nl}Now, prove your will and skills. Are you ready?
I like the determined look on your face.{nl}A true mergen utilize archery and arrows effectively to shoot down the oncoming monsters.
{nl}Monsters at Alemeth Forest or Nahash Forest shall be your targets. Of course, you are welcome to strike down even stronger targets.{nl}What I will be looking for is your speed.
{nl}Defeat one monster and within 8 seconds, strike down another one.{nl}Defeat eight monsters in this way and I will prove your worth.
It doesn't matter which monster, as long as it is as strong or stronger than that of Nahash or Nahash Forest.{nl}Remember, defeat a monster within 8 seconds of defeating another one.{nl}8 of them successively.
You are successful.{nl}I approve that you have what it takes to learn the archery of a mergen.
Mergen archery is the ultimate stage of archery.{nl}Shoot different types of arrows to eliminate the target.
That is the true intention of purpose of any form of archery.{nl}No other form of archery can match the efficiency and the number of foes one can strike down like mergen archery.
You seems to have gotten the hang of leading people.
{nl}Good.{nl}Show me your leadership and charisma.
The location nor types of monsters matter.{nl}Defeat 300 monsters with your comrades or followers.
If a monster is defeated by your party member or a member of your guild that you lead. I will count it as a triple score.
You could do it alone but that somewhat defeats the whole purpose.{nl}The number of monsters defeated by your guild members will count as triple.
{nl}A taks is done much faster if you are with someone whom you can trust.
Great work.{nl}Impressive.
Now, I will let you in an advanced stage of a templar.
Your blade has become more precise and sharp.{nl}But the actual proof is needed for your final advancement.{nl}
Remember your first trial?{nl}It's fitting that your last one would resemble it.
This time, it shall take place not in Forest of Prayer. Instead you will fight the monsters with the similar levels as you.{nl}Are you prepared to partake in your final trial?
Anyway, defeat monsters of similar levels.{nl}You can double the count by defeating stronger ones.
Monsters weaker than you don't count.{nl}I will await good news.
Show me how you have sharpened your fencer skills.{nl}What I would like you to do is defeat 80 of monsters as strong as you are. I believe the task won't be that difficult.
My, you get stronger by the seconds.{nl}I will teach you the final skills, now.
You've shown me your great determination so far.{nl}Now, it is time for you to prove your ultimate strength.{nl}
Are you ready to be acknowledged as a true Doeppelsoeldner?
Good.{nl}Confidence is the basic virtue of a mercenary.{nl}
Go to Khonot Forest and defeat 5 monters. Simple, innit?{nl}But the catch is that you need to defeat one within 10 seconds after your previous takedown.
Defeat five monsters in succession and I will give you the final lesson, you deserve.{nl}For the task tests your speed and agility that are vital to a Doppelsoeldner like yourself.{nl}
Remember. We always stand victorious against all odds.
Be confident and sweep them off.{nl}Lure them in and defeat them all. Five is frankly not a challenge at all.
My eyes did not deceive me about you.{nl}You are one good mercenary.{nl}
Now, your final lesson as a Doppelsoeldner.{nl}Get ready.
Welcome. You are just in luck.{nl}I actually have a request to you.{nl}
Few days ago, a member of my family clan, Brockal Himil, sent a messenager.{nl}The messenger got missing around Vedas Plateau.
{nl}We need to find out what happened to the messenger.
I believe the messenger was attacked.{nl}Take this red crystal with you.
The crystal has been handed down in our family for generations.{nl}It is paired with the blue crystal. When they get close to each other they react.{nl}The messenger has the blue one.
{nl}If anything happens to the messenger, we would know by using this crystal.{nl}Please, get to Vedas Plateau and use the red crystal to find the whereabouts of the messenger.
I am counting on you.{nl}I hope it was an attack.{nl}
I beg of you to look for it.
Only the blue crystal remained in snow?{nl}The messenger is either kidnapped or attacked.{nl}
I will sent out a rescue party.{nl}We cannot lose a loyal messenger.
{nl}Thank you for your troubles.{nl}As a compensation, I will teach you the new dragoon skills.
Lancer Master
Monsters are the problem any where.{nl}What seems to be the problem?{nl}
You want to be a lancer?{nl}You came this far, so you are not completely devoid of some skills.{nl}
Let's test your might.
I am currently examining the intel I have received about the Order of the Tree  of Truth who attacked the prince.{nl}I am far too occupied with the task at hand. So I have sent another lancer in my stead.{nl}
But the one who was supposed to go met with some problem.{nl}If you are willing, could you go to Nheto Forest and search the area for the traces of the Order?
The monsters and those who threaten the royal family must be eliminated. For the glory of thew kingdom.{nl}
{nl}So, could I ask you to get to Nheto Forest and find the traces of those heretics?
Hmm the seal matches that of the Order.{nl}It is a bit smudged but it will serve as a big clue.{nl}
This needs to be seen by the Inquisitor Master.{nl}Well done, I must say.{nl}Now, I will let you in on the art of Lancery.
Murmillo Master
You came here to be a murmillo?{nl}A murmillo don't rely on flashy skills but pure strength.{nl}
How does that sound? Interested?
Your confidence is admirable.{nl}I will give you a simple task to prove yourself.{nl}
The mission involves a giant monster. How about you take care of it?{nl}If you succeed, I will teach you to become a murmillo.{nl}
The monster is called Silva Griffin.{nl}The monster is attacking the people on Grynas Trails.
{nl}If what you say is true, you can take it down.
You are not scared are you?{nl}
Hmm, you came earlier than I expected.{nl}I was a bit worried about you.{nl}
I will keep my end of the promise.{nl}Be warned, I am a stern teacher.{nl}
The life as a gladiator is not a cake walk.{nl}The scars on your body are like your medals.
Good. I knew you have the guts.{nl}Near the kingdom camp on Steel Heights, recently there has been sightings of strange objects.{nl}
They are impervious to any sword or spear attacks.{nl}So they came to us, the cannoneers. For the demolition work.{nl}
You catch my drift?{nl}I would like you to go to Steel Heights and destroy strange objects.
You have already learnt how to fire from a distance.{nl}Now, it's time to learn precision and speed.
{nl}A musketeer needs fire weapon mastery.{nl}Taking your enemies before they even approach you. What more could you want from a battle?
{nl}Ready?
Good.{nl}When you go left from here, there is a pole to practice your marksmanship.{nl}
When the light reflects off from the pole, attack the pole accurately.{nl}You should not attack it too late nor when the light doesn't shine.{nl}You get three tries.
More you miss, more you have to hit.
Precision and speed.{nl}You cannot bring back the speeding bullet, after all.
Fire when the pell shines.
Your marksmanship is impressive.{nl}Now, let the lesson begin.

The Shinobi Master of the First Battle for the Throne - Volume 1
Night had fallen. A man of some years rested his tired legs on a small rock by the forest road. He had left with an adequate vehicle and plenty of luggage, yet he now carried nothing but the weight of his own body.
 A young boy no older than twenty stood guard behind him, a single sword in his hands. Six servants, men and women, had found a comfortable place to sit and rest nearby.{nl}Surrounding them was an armed group of nine men and women, seemingly soldiers or warriors. They too enjoyed a break, each sitting or standing at their positions.
 It was a cold early Spring in the year 601 of the Kingdom; times were as restless as the news coming from the kingdom's capital.{nl}Beside the man, another man gazed steadily at him. He was several decades older and supported his weight on a cane. The elder was armed with a single visible sword.
 He faced the resting man and spoke quietly.{nl}"A year ago we commemorated the 600 years of our Kingdom; now we can barely be certain of what future awaits us. Your Highness."
 "Yes, I too believed we would be far from trouble if only His Highness was treated with the priests' divine cure. I too never thought we would end up roaming the woods, unable to so much as attend His funeral. But Sir Sederberg, remember I haven't yet become the official heir to the throne."
 "Rael III has passed, and the late king left no sons or daughters. Who else but Your Highness would ascend in such conditions? Neither Duke Techel nor Duke Varchel are fit for the throne."
 "Under the law, they and I are the same in the line of succession. Our ties may be distant, but we all descend from the royal lineage of Great King Zachariel. I do not wish to escalate this into a civil war. One civil war in the reign of King Kadumel was more than enough for the history of our nation."{nl}The young man holding the sword behind the two joined the conversation.
 "I'm afraid there will be no other way to decide the heir but by force. Not even for King Malkiel and King Chaspael before us have the goddesses taken a side in our political disputes.{nl}What's more, the three of you are under equal footing before the law. Chancellor Roibuos is merely looking over His Higness' funeral and kingdom affairs, he does not have a say in the sucession."
 Sederberg reacted to his words.{nl}"Anyone attempting to interfere with such matters would be infringing our national laws. They would be guilty of treason, Sir Alfred."
 The young Alfred Hutton spoke again.{nl}"Precisely. This cannot be resolved by the law or judged by all the officers in the kingdom, neither can we leave it to the will of the goddesses. What else then, other than force, is the answer?...  ... Who is there!"
 Alfred Hutton suddenly fell silent and withdrew his sword. Cosomel, the man at the center of the conversation, remained undisturbed and merely said,{nl}"Mora."
 At once, a woman appeared by Cosomel's side.{nl}Alfred Hutton sheathed his sword, protesting,{nl}"We know you're a Shinobi, but there's no need to startle us like that, Mora Saizo."
 Shinobi Mora told Hutton without looking.{nl}"You are far too proud and reliant on your swordsmanship. It might not be enough to keep His Highness safe. It would be wise for you to mind your surroundings. I was here before you could even sense me."
 Cosomel started to speak before their conversation began to lengthen.{nl}"Stop. Give me the report."{nl}Mora Saizo began to speak.{nl}"There is good news and bad news."{nl}"Continue."
 "The good news is that you have the Winterspoons' support. As a sign of their support, Riena the house's head wizard will arrive to aide you."{nl}"That is indeed good news. Surely, the endorsement from the Winterspoons will be of great help when all the other families are too scared to get involved. Now, let me hear the bad one."
 "Duke Varchel will endorse Duke Techel. Furthermore, Marquis Tenstun will also be endorsing Duke Techel." Sederberg said,{nl}"Duke Varchel showed no real interest in the throne so we can assume he would not take actions himself. But still, his involvement... could the Tiberinas' influence in play here?" Alfred Hutton continued where Sederberg left off.{nl}
"At the moment, no royal official, clergymen or Magic Association are taking any actions. That being said, if such endorsement is put forward, Chancellor Roibuos will step forward to give his endorsement openly in order to prevent any further chaos.	왕국의 관료들과 여러 교단 그리고 마법사 협회 등등 누구도 나서지 않는 상황에서 그 정도의 지지를 공개적으로 얻어내면, 로이부오스 재상께서 더 이상의 혼란을 방치하지 않기 위해서라도 공개적 지지를 할 가능성이 있습니다.				제1차 왕위 계승분쟁기의 시노비 마스터 - 제1권
QUEST_LV_0300_20161214_007629	At the moment, no royal official, clergymen or Magic Association are taking any actions. That being said, if such endorsement is put forward, Chancellor Roibuos will step forward to give his endorsement openly in order to prevent any further chaos."
 Mora followed after Hutton.{nl}"Gaining the support of another influential family would certainly balance out the situation. Securing the endorsement of two families, however, could tilt the scale of public recognition in our favor."
 Cosomel pondered briefly before speaking.{nl}"We are on the way to meet with the Black family to solicit their support. Should we succeed to persuade them by tonight, we can solve at least half of our impediment. That would leave one other family to approach, but who?"
 It was Hutton who replied,{nl}"What does Your Highness say of appealing to Marquis Tenstun? He might have sided with Duke Techel, but I don't believe he is particularly fond of him."{nl}Sederberg opposed vehemently.
 "We shan't go to Tenstun. Have you forgotten about the quarantine uproar that happened in his lands? Had that disaster not aggravated His Highness' condition, His Highness could very well still be among us.
 As I see it, the mere fact that Techel is supported by someone as despicable as Tenstun makes him unfit for the throne. I say, should His Higness Cosomel become king, the titles and lands of the Tenstuns ought to be impounded. I see no need to forge ties with such a vile human."
 Hutton nodded and said,{nl}"I still believe the Tenstuns' wealth will become a great threat to us. As much as it may have been accumulated through corrupted means, that is."
 Then, Sederberg spoke. "If wealth is your concern, is there no family to surpass the Tunstons? The family owning the vastest lands in the kingdom."{nl}"Do you speak of the Green family? I was under the impression they concerned themselves solely with their farms and orchards. They consider any additional profit gained from their crops a blessing of the goddesses, every year donating it to religious orders or the poor. Is that not their custom? I don't believe they would take interest in our affairs."
 Cosomel replied, laughing.{nl}"And yet, with their support, we may just end this ordeal without shedding a drop of blood."{nl} 
Sederberg agreed.{nl}"The Winterspoons boast a long tradition of alchemy and science, the Blacks have gathered a roster of military connections since the days of Lydia Schaffen, and the Greens, along with their wealth, have the trust of the people. Should all three families endorse our cause, I'm certain this dispute will cease before a war arises."
 Cosomel spoke.{nl}"Then it shall happen. Should a war occur, the few noblemen supporting Techel and myself will summon their troops. But regardless of who wins, the royal army is bound to intervene if the battles persist.
If so, either the royal army decides the successor, or one ascends by action of their supporting troops. Both cases are undesirable. Victory must be assured before this dispute turns into a war.
Be it I or Techel, whoever loses must be exiled to the Woodlands for the rest of his days. Not doing so will endanger the future of the kingdom, regardless of who succeeds."
 Hutton reacted as such:{nl}"I'm certain of our victory, but I believe the defeated should be exiled to Kalejimas, not the Woodlands."{nl}Cosomel laughed heartily and replied,{nl}"I'm well aware of your dislike for Techel, but that seems rather harsh, no? Either way, who shall we send to meet with the Greens?"
Sederberg spoke.{nl}"As the eldest, I believe I myself should go."{nl}Cosomel shook his head.{nl}"No. The Blacks are virtuous people. They will not be convinced lest the future Chancellor of the kingdom is present."
 Hutton came forward instead.{nl}"I shall go, then."
Cosomel had begun to ponder on Hutton's proposal when Mora spoke.{nl}"Hutton is too young. What's more, he will be needed to escort Your Highness. The Blacks are a family of military tradition. I believe Hutton's swordsmanship could earn us their recognition. I shall go to the Greens."
 Hutton spoke again.{nl}"I don't intend to dismiss Mora's judgment, but I do believe a Shinobi would be somewhat of a stranger to the court. Would someone with a certain degree of nobility such as myself not be better suited for the task?"
 Mora, once again, objected.{nl}"Hutton may be bright, but brightness alone does not suffice to persuade the Greens, considering their position. Shinobis are masters of information and strategy. Trust me with this task and I shall earn the support of the Greens."
 Cosomel hesitated.{nl}"One must be cautious not to let any strategies end up smearing our names."{nl}Mora Saizo replied.{nl}"Trust me. I can assure you I will not let anything hinder Your Highness' dignity. I only require a letter to prove my status to the Green family."
 "I am  counting on you. If I obtain the throne, Shinobis shall come out of the shadows and get the recognition and the master they deserve. Of course, the First Master shall be Mora Saizo. Moreover, those who pick up your mantle shall work for the royal court."
 "It's an honor, Your Highness. I have a long journey ahead of myself, I make haste and start. Sir Alfred Hutton, His Highness' safety depends on your sword. Be wise."{nl}Without waiting for the others to reply, Mora Saizo vanished.{nl}Hutton was left muttering to himself after the already-absent Mora.{nl}"If that is such a concern, why not take the skills of someone who defended His Highness from assassination several times and go to Duke Techel instead..."
 Sederberg did not hesitate to retort.{nl}"Must we really follow Techel?  Nobody wants the King to ascend by assassination less than I do."
 "Yes, sir."{nl}Cosomel spoke over Hutton's soft reply.{nl}"I may not have Mora by my side, but I am accompanied the best swordsman in the Kingdom. I have no reason to fear danger.  We've rested enough. Shall we continue our journey?"
 Hutton could not help but to strongly agree.{nl}"Yes!" Your Highness."
Ah, you must be a Revelator.{nl}Perhaps,

 compiles important contemporary information.{nl}I am currently writing the next volume.
{nl}So far I've collected and organized the materials, and part of it is completed.{nl}Now I only need confirmation from each Master about the contents.
{nl}Unfortunately, I've been rather busy with the restoration of an important document.{nl}My pupils are focused on this work as well.{nl}
s contents still need to be confirmed. May I ask for your help?
Oh, thank you.{nl}The faster the book is complete, the better.{nl}The meaning will be lost if I take too long, you see.
{nl}I need confirmation from four Masters, but the Sapper Master has already sent in his reply.{nl}I only need you to check with the three other Masters.
{nl}One of my pupils has already delivered the letter to the Druid Master on the way to Fedimian, so I simply need her reply.{nl}As for the Fencer and Necromancer Masters, I will ask you to deliver them these letters.

Encyclopedia of Masters, Chapter 2
What can I do for you?
Oh, the request from the Sage Master.{nl}I meant to send in my reply, but it somehow was delayed until now.{nl}
I see no problem with the contents.{nl}My childhood was indeed spent in the lands of the Greene family, feeling and communing with nature.{nl}
All our lands are sold away now.{nl}It wasn't my intent, but thanks to that decision we were able to help many others after Medzio Diena.{nl}
You may take my reply to the Sage Master.{nl}I ought to have sent it earlier, I'm sorry for making you come all the way here.
If it's from the Sage Master, it must be about  
, is it?{nl}
We did discuss it last time we met, but I didn't think he would contact me so soon.{nl}You see...{nl}
I was on my way to find the fencing textbooks donated by my family to the kingdom.{nl}It seems some thieves took advantage of Medzio Diena to steal a few books from the royal archives.{nl}
I do recall some of our textbooks being stolen then.{nl}Rumor has it the thieves hid them at the Guards Graveyard, so that's where I was planning to go.
{nl}The books aren't all that special, but I feel it's my duty to retrieve them as they belong to my family.{nl}Would you maybe...  go and check the Guards Graveyard while I write my reply?
{nl}If what I heard about you is right, it should be an easy task.{nl}Remember it's only a rumor, so you can return if you happen to find nothing there.
The Sage Master truly outdid himself, his research is impressively extensive.{nl}I'll be counting on you to check up on the Guards Graveyard.{nl}
I hope this time I can finally retrieve our books.
Year XX, XX of XX.
{nl}I finally succeeded in hiding all the stolen books.{nl}This fencing textbook is the last, but there has been a problem.{nl}
I avoided a huge monster and hid the books in the deepest corner of Guards Graveyard.{nl}As I was about to leave, a strange device was activated and I was trapped there for a good while.{nl}
I barely managed to escape.{nl}I can't move my legs properly, most likely from being trapped for so long.
{nl}To make matters worse, I was attacked by a group of monsters.{nl}I'm so close to the exit...
You brought it back.{nl}It's severely damaged, but it is the Hutton's fencing textbook without a doubt!
{nl}It seems the rumor was true after all.{nl}Thank you.
{nl}Thanks to you I was able to retrieve one of my family's lost textbooks.{nl}This is the letter.
{nl}It's my reply to the contents of the Sage Master's book.{nl}The next volume of Encyclopedia of Masters...  Please tell him I look forward to it.
What can I do for you?{nl}A favor from the Sage Master?{nl}
Hmm...  Yeah, he mentioned it.{nl}Alright, I'll write him an answer.{nl}But you gotta help me with a quick experiment, how does that sound?
My experiment is about giving a spirit to objects to bring them to life.{nl}I left a few spirit-collecting machines at Carlyle's Mausoleum.
{nl}There must be a ton of spirits around them by now.{nl}You catch the spirits and collect them with the machine. Then behind them is a doll where you cast them into.
{nl}What you need to do is use my machines to catch the spirits.{nl}When a machine is full, then you can turn it on again.
{nl}Do that and the spirits are gonna be cast into the doll.{nl}But you need to be careful...
{nl}There's gonna be a few innocent spirits in there, but you can't catch those.{nl}That's the one condition the grave keeper told me.
{nl}So make sure you only get the red spirits.{nl}Alright, I'm counting on you.
The machines are pretty simple, you'll know what to do.{nl}Just remember to catch only the red spirits.
So the doll went completely kaput after the spirits went in?{nl}Hmm...  Failed again, eh?{nl}
Anyway, good work. Thanks for helping.{nl}Alright, here's my letter to the Sage Master.
Oh, would you mind giving me a hand?{nl}There's a rumor saying a Yellow Gazing Golem has been spotted recently.
{nl}It usually appears only in Demon Prison 1F, you see. I must make sure.{nl}Unfortunately I'm caught up in an investigation and can't afford to check everything myself.
That's very reassuring.{nl}I'll ask you to first go check the Grynas Hills area.
I'm counting on you.{nl}I'm worried that the rumor might be true...
You've returned.{nl}How did it go?{nl}
So there really was a Yellow Gazing Golem?{nl}Hm...  It seems the sightings of Gazing Golems really were true.
But why would these monsters suddenly appear in other areas?{nl}I think this requires a more extensive investigation.{nl}
Would you be willing to help a bit more?
Then, set up this crystal in Demon Prison District 1 and defeat the Gazing Golems there.{nl}The crystal will automatically collect information on the Golems' magic flow and other data.
This time it's Demon Prison District 1.{nl}Good luck.
Let's see, this looks sufficient.{nl}Very well done.{nl}
I'm going to analyze the information collected.
These Gazing Golems seem to be related to something else.{nl}Although I can't really tell what it is...{nl}
I need to investigate further.{nl}
I would like to have a look at some Gazing Golem fragments.{nl}There may be traces of magic...{nl}
There was a sighting in Knidos Jungle as well, would you mind looking there?{nl}If a Gazing Golem appears, I would like you to collect some fragments.
If they're appearing at Knidos Jungle as well, that means their area is lot broader... But why...?
You collected the fragments.{nl}May I have a look?
If there's traces of mana, that means it's connected to a person.{nl}Someone could be using the Golems to cover up for something.
{nl}I'm so sorry for the trouble, but would you check the Gazing Golems again?{nl}This time I need their magic cores.
{nl}Please do me this favor, I'll be very grateful.
We're very close, this won't take too much of your time.{nl}I need you to attack the Gazing Golems and remove their magic cores before they are destroyed.{nl}
It should be fairly easy for someone of your talent.{nl}But keep in mind that the Golems will be destroyed after a few moments of being incapacitated.{nl}
Oh, and you can get the cores at either Knidos Jungle or Grynas Hills.{nl}I'll be investigating Demon Prison District 1 one last time meanwhile.
Thank you.{nl}Be careful not to let the magic cores be damaged.
You're back.{nl}I've also just returned.{nl}
I'll have a look at the magic cores, then.{nl}Hmm...{nl}
As I thought, this magic is connected to a person.{nl}It looks as if someone was using the Gazing Golems to inspect different areas.{nl}
This could be the work of demons...{nl}I need to trace this back to its source.
From the information collected by analyzing the Golems in the Demon Prison...
{nl}We can infer that the Gazing Golems were likely using a portal.{nl}If we can find traces of the person on the other side, we can follow the link.
I've prepared two different devices.
{nl}The first one is used to track the link of the Gazing Golems when a portal is created.{nl}The other is a camouflage crystal to hide you from the Golems.
{nl}As long as you're carrying the camouflage crystal, the Golems will not attack.
{nl}Avoid the Golems and install the link tracking device in Demon Prison District 1.{nl}Don't worry, I will keep in touch with you through the camouflage crystal.
Be careful, it could be dangerous.{nl}Make sure the Gazing Golems don't see you.
{nl}The camouflage crystal needs to be out for some time to take effect.
You installed the device!{nl}Seeing how it's reacting, it looks like a portal is about to open!{nl}
Go back to the place where the device is installed!{nl}If you defeat the Gazing Golem there, the one linked to the Golems will appear!
The tracking device will now temporarily link you with the owner of the Golems.
{nl}Are you ready?
Baiga
Wondering why you still can't see anything?{nl}There's nothing you can do about it, so keep quiet and listen.{nl}
It's funny to think a fool like you would dare to try me.
{nl}I am Demon King Baiga.{nl}
I certainly heard a lot about you.
{nl}My curiosity is satisfied now, so I won't harm you.{nl}But make no mistakes, interfere with my plans again and I will end you.{nl}
Of course, everything will end eventually.{nl}Your prying could simply make things end a little sooner for you.{nl}Your status as a powerful Revelator won't help you then.{nl}
Bear this in mind.{nl}Not even the goddesses defy me, Revelator.
I lost contact with you for a while, I was so worried!{nl}What happened?
{nl}Huh?
{nl}So the one using the Gazing Golems wasn't just an ordinary demon but Demon King Baiga?{nl}
And the warning he gave you...{nl}This is serious...{nl}
Monsters controlled by a Demon King...{nl}With all the Gazing Golem sightings recently, could that mean Baiga is starting to take action?{nl}
I've come to learn very important facts thanks to your help.{nl}Thank you.
So you're the one the Sage Master sent. Thought you looked familiar.{nl}If you have some time, would you mind giving me a hand?{nl}
Like you read on the Sage Master's letter, before Medzio Diena I sold most of the land I had inherited.
{nl}But as you know, with the chaos of Medzio Diena...{nl}The people who bought my land then are now going through serious hardship.{nl}
I can't simply turn my back on their situation, so I want to do something for them.{nl}I already gave most of them a certificate signed by myself, but I'm still missing Herbalist Calsis.{nl}
I was hoping you could help me find him.
Thank you for your kindness.{nl}You may go to Orsha and ask about his whereabouts or someone who might have seen him.
{nl}I know he left his daughter in Klaipeda and went to Orsha, but that's the last I heard of him.
Please, I must find Calsis...
So you heard he left for Knidos Jungle to collect herbs?{nl}But I thought all the herbalists were avoiding the jungle because of the demons lately...
He even said he wanted to live as a farmer with his daughter when he bought the land from me...{nl}It really seems he's having trouble making ends meet after Medzio Diena.{nl}
If you don't mind, would you go to Knidos Jungle and look for him?{nl}I would go there myself, but I  need to see the other people who bought my land.
{nl}You may just find something if you ask the other herbalists at Knidos Jungle.{nl}
Thank you.{nl}If you find Herbalist Calsis, make sure to deliver my certificate to him.
Going back to Knidos Jungle at a time when most herbalists are escaping it...{nl}I'm a little worried for him.{nl}
I sure hope he's safe, for the sake of his daughter...
You're looking for Mr. Calsis?{nl}He left a few weeks ago and hasn't returned since.{nl}
I'm keeping hold of his belongings for now but... they still need to be organized.{nl}The monsters of Dadan Jungle have been wrecking havoc down here lately, so I didn't have the time.{nl}
If you can help me, I can get his belongings organized for you.
Right now there's a group of monsters from Dadan Jungle causing all sorts of trouble at Neneva Yard.{nl}If you can defeat them, I can get Calsis' belongings meanwhile.
It's not easy collecting herbs anymore with all the demons around... The herbalists that used to work here all went back.
{nl}I'm also thinking of going back after I finish organizing Mr. Calsis' belongings.
You defeated them!{nl}Thank you.
{nl}First, there's something you should know before I tell you where his belongings are.{nl}Mr. Calsis returned to this jungle a few months ago to collect herbs.
{nl}When he first left, he said he had bought some land somewhere and was going to become a farmer, but after Medzio Diena he came back.{nl}Sometimes he visited his daughter in Klaipeda.
{nl}A few weeks ago, he said he found a very special herb and was very happy about it.{nl}Then he left and never came back. I assumed he had gone to see his daughter.
{nl}But then I received a letter from the daughter saying her dad never came back.{nl}She thought something had happened to him here in the jungle...
This is all I know.{nl}I've gathered his belongings in a box.{nl}
It's at the box pile in Croa Village.{nl}Hopefully it will help you find Mr. Calsis.
This looks like the pile of boxes mentioned by Herbalist Ash.
Calsis' belongings are inside the box.
There is a diary inside the box labeled 'Calsis'.
Calsis' Diary
[Month: xx Day:xx Year:xxxx]{nl}After long and hard days of thinking, I left Selphie in Klaipeda and came back to this place.{nl}
This place ain't what it used to be. Now it is crawling with those darn monsters and demons.{nl
[Month: xx Day:xx Year:xxxx]{nl}I miss the time of having a farm with Selphie. It was short but sweet like no other.
The money I paid to get that land...{nl}Have Goddesses forsaken us?{nl}
[Month: xx Day:xx Year:xxxx]{nl}It has been weeks since I returned.{nl}
I met with Selphie and handed her the money I have made.{nl}
Next time, I oughtta go further deep.{nl}But those demons...{nl}
Month: xx Day:xx Year:xxxx]{nl}I arrived at the deep part of Dadan Jungle. Demons and mighty strange looking thingamabobs gave me a hell of troubles.{nl}
It was all worth it.{nl}Arzeli!{nl}
The flower known to even raise the dead. This will do just fine for me and Selphie.{nl}It's a shame, it's not yet full grown. I gotta watch it grow.{nl}
[Month: xx Day:xx Year:xxxx]{nl}i don't feel well.{nl}
I saw him leading a bunch of monster to the monastery...{nl}What on earth is going on.{nl}
Can't be distracted, in about a week from now, I can get that Arzeli.{nl}I got a little scratch from a monster. Better be careful next time.{nl}
[Month: xx Day:xx Year:xxxx]{nl}i don't feel well.{nl}
Monsters more and more it worrys me{nl}must make the call{nl}
Get that arzeli and sell it so Selphie and i can live well and rest for a while{nl}Selphie, oh how i miss you.
Selphie
What?{nl}Do you mean my father's missing?{nl}He was supposed to be back already...
{nl}Oh, these are the Druid Master's certificate and my father's diary.{nl}He will be glad to know about this...
{nl}From the contents of his diary, it seems he went somewhere dangerous.{nl}More than once, too...
{nl}After I told him not to go...{nl}Thank you for bringing back his diary.
{nl}Thank you so much...{nl}I know my father will be back...
Oh, I see.{nl}Calsis wasn't around so you delivered the certificate to his daughter.{nl}Very well.
{nl}Calsis, however...{nl}I can't help but wonder if something happened in the jungle...
{nl}A tragic happening indeed.{nl}Could it have been prevented if I had helped a little sooner, I wonder?
{nl}I can only pray that peace will soon return to our world.{nl}Thank you for your help.
My father will be back...{nl}He will...{nl}
Thank you for bringing back his diary...
Found the arzeli, but Calsis is nowhere to be seen.
Now unto the next test!{nl}In the past, I have dashingly eliminated monsters for the sake of immigrants to the Lemprasa Pond.
Those monsters reared their ugly heads again.{nl}What I will do is give you this immensely powerful crystal hand-crafted by yours truly.{nl}
Bury it  underneath the entrance to the village.
Ah, good question!{nl}Let me explain this crystal. It strikes fear into the hearts of monsters. For they are a cowardly and sperstitious lot.{nl}
How to make one is a trade secret, my dear would-be student.{nl}When the time comes and you earn your studenthood, I just might teach you.{nl}
Students are go!{nl}Prithee, be haste, those innocent immigrants are suffering from the monsters!{nl}
Bury these crystals on suitable spots near the entrance to the village near Lamprasa Pond.
Use my brilliant invention to lift them of their predicament!
Welcome back!{nl}What? Chupacabra jumped on you?{nl}
It happened while you were burying it right?{nl}Or perhaps, the terror was too much for Chupacabra to take and went insane.{nl}
Haha! Well, the problem is no more, then all is good.{nl}My eyes did not deceive me when I chose you as my student-candidate!
This test will be much harder, so be prepared.{nl}I am to deliver the reagent, again, made by the Greatest Problem-Solver of all time to the Miners' Village Mayor. But alas, the trouble be!
Dried leaves, one of the key ingredient, they ran out.{nl}
Hmm, what's that look on your face.{nl}This is no ordinary dried leaves.{nl}
In the Nheto Forest, the leaves are all red, after Medzio Diena.{nl}Grind them and put them into my reagent. It works wonders.{nl}
All you have to do is gather up those leaves.{nl}Why so easy, you might wonder. No worries, the monsters are quite ferocious there.{nl}Take care.
The Great Muchhausen is not known for misjudging a person's capability. So I trust you and my own eyes!
Now, the leaves.{nl}A bit dangerous but for you it won't be.
{nl}My eyes never deceive me!
You are earlier than I expected!{nl}I am a damn good judge of a character!
Wait for a minute.{nl}I will just make the glorious reagent.
Voila!{nl}I sometimes surprise myself!{nl}
Please, deliver this reagent to the mayor of Miners' Village.{nl}They must be waiting sick for this beauty.{nl}
Oh and please tell the mayor, Baron Munchhausen sends his regards.
Ah, the good Baron Munchausen has sent you.{nl}We were waiting for it.{nl}
Its effect is quite good, even our healer lady is impressed.{nl}Because only the Baron knows how to make them, we constantly ask him for it.
The mayor will be waiting for you.
Ah, you came!{nl}You return with the mayor's gratitude?{nl}
All in the day's work of Baron Munchausen. Nothing to be alarmed about!
Enough about me. Let's talk about your final test.{nl}Pass this one and you will have the honor of calling yourself a student to Baron Munchausen the Gr-rrr-reat Problem-Solver of all time!
The rumor among the guards has it.{nl}There are ghosts on the Guards Graveyard.{nl}
This gem will drive away those evil spirits. Go to the Guards Graveyard and drive them all away.{nl}Quite similar to your first test but this time it won't be as easy.{nl}
But the danger is expected when you are willing to be the student of the Great Mentor like myself.
Please, be careful.{nl}Succeed in this and you are the student of Baron Munchausen!
The moment you held out the gem, the leaf bug horde swarmed in?{nl}Perhaps, you who cannot see ghosts might have seen them as monsters.{nl}
Well, all seems to be in order.{nl}Like I have said, my eyes never deceive me!{nl}
You are the student to Baron Munchausen the Grrreat Problem-Solver!{nl}You may take pleasure in spreading the word!{nl}
Hmm, I have some important business to attend. I will be going.{nl}If Fate willing we shall meet again, my dear Student!
Hm?{nl}You have a question?
Yes, he is quite eccentric in his speech and manners but{nl}he is also one of the kindest souls I have ever seen.{nl}
He helps out many people both knowingly and unknowingly.{nl}His eccentricity and ego are quite strong...{nl}
They are his charms, I think.{nl}Anyway, thanks for bringing it to us.{nl}
Please, send my gratitude to the Baron.
Tell him. We owe him greatly.

1. Sorsha Hutton{nl}{nl}The founder of the Huttons was born in the time of King Rael II and later made a significant contribution to King Cosomel in the Battle for the Throne. As a reward, received land and a nobility title.{nl}For several centuries, the Huttons focused on improving their own brand of swordsmanship. The house of the Huttons considered  noble education, land management and skills in combat of utmost importance. Those who did not meet the standard were sent out of the land. Great care and focus were on swordsmanship..{nl}
Young Sorsha Hutton showed unparalleled talents even in the history of her family. She applied for the Fencer Master position.{nl}Not all the Fencer Masters have been from the Huttons but a Hutton applies and there is no one that could rival the Hutton. Full support was given to her.{nl}
2. Loreta Nimbus{nl}{nl}She was born in the later era of King Damiel and got on the master position in the era of King Frienel.{nl}Her greatest achievement that dwarves that of her foremasters is discovering a way to obtain longevity through absorbing the life force.{nl}The first beneficiary of this technique was of course herself and she became a member of Amjinas. These two factors rendered any need for successors to the  Necromancer Master position.{nl}
3. Gina Greene{nl}{nl}The house of the Greenes owns the largest amount of land.{nl}Gina Greene grew up in various parts of her family land and it was such experience that made her choose the path to the Druid Master.{nl}
Furthermore, when she inherited the largest portion of the land, she sold the land for it was not right for a Druid Master to get tied to a specific location. The money she has made from the transaction is entrusted in the Kedora Merchant Alliance. Her wealth provokes envy even from the Pardoner Master.{nl}Her action was not based on any pursuit of financial gains nor did she expected or anticipated such but her decision was a highly profitable one given that after Medzio Diena wrecked almost all the land.{nl}
Of course, her interest was not in the money and she supported her kins and many other people who have suffered from Medzio Diena.
4. Leonard Quicktongue{nl}{nl}Leonard Quicktongue the Sapper Master is not the name given to him by his parents.{nl}He achieved quite an infamy in his adolescence as a thief. He stole army supplies and his father who was a soldier took the blame.{nl}Because it was his son's deeds, he could not prove his innocence. It is said that he never met the Sapper Master until the day he died.{nl}
Quicktongue reformed of his way and became a soldier himself. He served as an officer and made a name for himself. However, despite continuous visit requests, his father only replied that if it is an order from a superior officer, he will visit.{nl}Perhaps it is due to such background, the Sapper Master does subtle charity work.
I am happy to help.
I am not particularly interested.

The Order of the Tree of Truth could have taken the treasures and properties from the villagers.{nl}That is why I am searching around in this monastery.
I am currently performing the task of delivering the souls of those who have been petrified. I cannot go to Dingofasil District.{nl}Instead, please install this gnyang spheres that will calm their nerves.
Spheres could at least comfort their minds...
You've installed them all.{nl}I thank you in the name of the goddess.
The box is quite heavy...
{nl}It must contain all that the Order of the Tree of Truth has stolen from the good villagers.{nl}But it's tightly locked so we cannot confirm what is inside.
Of course! The Corsair Master!{nl}The Corsair Master once visited the monastery before.
{nl}At the time, the key to the sacred box was lost and monks were having some difficulties with it.{nl}The Corsair Master saw our trouble and opened it without any problem whatsoever.
{nl}He used some sort of needle on the key hole...{nl}Asking the Corsair Mater how he did it.
Take the Box and go to the Corsair Master.
You want me to open the box?{nl}No problem, matey.
The box should be open in the blink of an eye.
The Corsair Master is opening the box.
Aye, this is not a problem.{nl}Say, why is the box filled with such precious things... ah, they are stolen and taken from the villagers by those Order of the Tree of Truth.
{nl}Extorting people, in this economy? Now that's cruel.
You opened the box.{nl}What was in it?
In tough times, we gotta help one another...
Why do look at me like that, hey?{nl}I may not have been much of a helper, but I sure didn't steal from anyone.
It was given to me at will.{nl}It's the truth, I'm telling ya!
I wonder if the kingdom knows how much we suffer.
I just want to go home and have warm potato dumplings.
So my suspicions were right.. The Tree of Truth was after the wealth of the villagers.{nl}We ought to return these objects to them.
I think I know what the commander is going to say.
You should go.{nl}The demons could get you before you know it.
These are things we offered those heretics... I feel so ashamed...{nl}Thank so much for returning our valuables.
Can I ask you to get me some strawberries?{nl}I just feel sorry for the other soldiers.
If you can bring me some strawberries, I wanna share them with the other soldiers.
Thank you so much for the strawberries.{nl}They're going to love it.
{nl}Although, we could make some iced punch if we had a little more...
I need to study the Carnivore remains to find out why the reagent failed.
Thank you for accepting our request.{nl}Not many people are willing to these days...
{nl}The Martuis Storage Room was only recently discovered and is still unexplored.{nl}I wish I could go and investigate myself but...{nl}The work here won't let me.
Thank you for carrying out our request.{nl}This is a very interesting type of magic I'm feeling.{nl}I need to study the dolls.{nl}{nl}
I would have never guessed someone would do a favor like this for me again.{nl}I was gonna do it myself but...{nl}As you know, you put one foot outside the convent and it's your life that's at risk...
{nl}Anyway, thank you.{nl}I can make some decent jewelry with this now!
I heard someone left a message, it must have been you!{nl}I had no way of communicating with other wizards...{nl}Thank you so much for fixing the device.
{nl}Anyway, just take care of yourself.{nl}Let me know if you need anything!
I've been looking for something like this for so long.{nl}Now I can carry on with all the things I was doing.
Finally I put my hands one something like this!{nl}I used to help the people who escaped from the capital.{nl}I was using this at my work and it was so useful.{nl}Thanks to you things just got a lot easier.{nl}Thank you so much.{nl}
Many were those who left in search of the legend of Alembique, but nothing was ever heard of them.{nl}Then, I heard about the cave sap from one of such travelers.{nl}I was planning to travel there after my work here was finished...{nl}But thanks to you I might not have to.{nl}Thank you.
I was surprised that you contacted me.{nl}How did you get in there?{nl}Did you find anything interesting?
{nl}I imagine you can't talk for long.{nl}Thank you for activating the device.{nl}Do tell me if you find anything.
I've always been collecting one or two at a time, but it's first time someone has ever brought so many.{nl}I think this will be very useful to the sisters.{nl}Thank you.
I was searching for someone who could bring me these claws.{nl}Fortunately I didn't need to search too far.{nl}A bit more would be perfect, but I suppose I can do with this much.{nl}Thank you.
Are you here to help us stop the demons?
{nl}Should you enter the convent here, you will be sent to one of the rooms currently under attack by the demons.{nl}If you succeed to keep them from reaching their goal, we will be happy to reward you.{nl}For one, this is where you can obtain Cubes of Blessing.
{nl}With the rewards from these cubes, you will be able to transcend your equipment and strengthen its features.{nl}But I must warn you, the demons in convent are very powerful.
{nl}We strongly advise you not to proceed unless you are with other adventurers.

Enhancing the harmful effects even further and to cure allies who are hurt by these effects.{nl}To put it simply, we are experts in harmful effects.
Of course I'd be willing to teach you all about it.{nl}But first, you must help me with something.{nl}
Many people have been falling ill recently.{nl}The disease itself isn't difficult to cure, but eliminating the source to keep others from contracting it is a much better solution.
Please visit the King's Plateau, Viltis Forest, Goddess' Ancient Garden and Knidos Jungle and bring me the reports from each Disease Detector.
Bring me the reports and I'll be glad to teach you.

Bullet Marker Master
You better know, the path to Bullet Marker isn't over, it's just begun.{nl}Not only must you have steady skill and training, but understanding basic properties is a must.{nl}I've prepared everything so we'll start now. 
Follow this trail and you'll see the training grounds.{nl}I'll mark it on your map, so don't get lost.{nl}There's a special reward if you score high, so give it your all.
The way to train is easy.{nl}
Just attack normally but after one attack, the property will disappear.{nl}You can recharge the property at the training ground so simply recharge and train.{nl} Keep in mind to attack with the correct property.
Ice against fire, fire against earth, earth against lightning, lightning against ice, divine against dark, and ace against all.
Twirling our Capote to excite the monsters and avoid attack, is the elegant dance of the Matador.
But if you want to get there, you'll need to practice.{nl}Oh ho, you really want to learn, huh?
I like your assertiveness.{nl}We'll start first with practicing how to twirl the Capote to lure monsters.
I've prepared a place where you can train in Stele Road.{nl}Go there and my assistant will fill you in on the details.
Matador's Assistant
You came because you heard from the Matador Master that you can train your Capote skills here?{nl}You found the right place.
I'll explain the training.
Go to Stele Road and you'll hear a more detailed explanation from my assistant.{nl} Follow her instruction well and learn as much as you can.
Hm..? Something seems different?{nl}Is it just my imagination?
Somehow you seem more like a Matador.
Finally I put my hands one something like this!{nl}I used to help the people who escaped from the capital.{nl}I was using this at my work and it was so useful.{nl}Thanks to you things just got a lot easier.{nl}Thank you so much.{nl}
The shadow is your reflection like how eclipses are reflections on the world.{nl}When you are able to successfully train your own reflection, you'll be able to call yourself a Shadowmancer. 
It would be good if you did some training to become more comfortable with your shadow.{nl}I've prepared a training device at Lajidota Fields for apprentices who are still getting used to their shadows.
{nl}Activate the device to begin your training.{nl}How well you train will decide your reward.
There is one thing you need to know about training. Simply training will do no good.{nl}Instead, by your own effort the training will be successful. I recommend keeping that in mind when training.
The training was hard, no?{nl}But if you don't put in the effort, your shadow will refuse to listen.{nl}Don't think about the difficulty, just keep at it. You'll succeed if you do.
You worked hard. But you're still lacking in parts.{nl}Keep trying and devote yourself to the task. Talk to me whenever you want to train again.
You came back to train again. The device is at Lajidota Fields.{nl}I'll be waiting to the see the fruits of your training.
It's good to want to improve but intense training can harm your body.{nl}It's important to take breaks, of course.{nl}If you would like to train more, come back again after you've rested.
{nl}Rumpelstiltskin thought about the proposal for a moment.{nl}The opponent is a human who have just discovered them. There was no way a powerful demon like him{nl}could ever be beaten by an ordinary human. He accepted the proposal.{nl}[Alright. I like it. Go on.]
{nl}Once Rumpelstiltskin accepted the idea, a further discussion on some ground rules and details went on and finally they reached an agreement. One of the terms was one could ask three questions to the other. Baroconsi started his question.{nl}[How many carriages would be needed to transport all of the gold in these veins?]
{nl}He thought about it but after a while, he figure{nl}even Baroconsi would not answer this question so he gave up. His reasoning was{nl}if Baroconsi doesn't know the answer as well, the round is a draw.
{nl}But as soon as Rumpelstiltskin gave up, Baroconsi answered{nl}[One carriage as big as these veins would certainly carry all the gold. So the answer is one.]
{nl}This, of course, infuriated Rumpelstiltskin and protested that that was not fair.{nl}Baroconsi did not even flinch and silently started at the giant demon who can easily squahs him with a tip of his finger.
{nl}Rumpelstiltskin eventually calmed down a bit. It was not in his nature to stop a game once it started. Furthermore, he took great pleasure from defeating his opponent no matter the circumstances or conditions. So he continued.
{nl}Baroconsi asked another question{nl}[My second question is this. You and I guess the amount of gold these veins would produce in a year and the one to guess the closest wins this round.]
{nl}At the question, Rumpelstiltskin added.{nl}[This time no trick with the scales. I will not tolerate such cheap trick anymore. And if you still do, I win.]
{nl}Baroconsi stared at Rumpelstiltskin straight in the eyes.{nl}Showing no sign of fear. {nl}Even when standing before a demon with infernal flame coming out of his head and razor sharp teeth gleaming with cruelty.{nl}[I give you my word on it. No scale trick this time.]
{nl}Baroconsi replied.{nl}[I am not quite sure how that would make it a win for you but it's irrelevant for I have a different number. My number is 0.]{nl}[What?]
{nl}[I will not have it. The second question is null.{nl}Or at least a draw.]{nl}Baroconsi did not argued with the demon's claim at all and continued.{nl}[Alright, the round is a draw. That means the next question will be a tie-breaker. I asked the questions twice in a row, so, it's only fair you do the question.]
{nl}Rumpelstiltskin was puzzled by his calm acceptance.{nl}But he did get what he wanted and it was his turn to ask. so his mind quickly became occupied with making a question. He thought about it for a moment and asked{nl}[Who will be the owner of these gold veins in one year?]  
{nl}The question was immediately followed by a stern warning from Rumpelstiltskin.{nl}[If you say the Kedora Merchant Alliance or any other person or entity, I will devour every single one of you. Of course, such task could not be done instantly.
{nl}Rumpelstiltskin glowing with a sense of victory looked at{nl} Baroconsi. The countenance of Baroconsi did not alter at all. As if to show he has been expecting the demon's answer all along simply answered.
{nl}[The owner of the gold veins in one year's time would be you,{nl}Rumpelstiltskin.] Rumpelstiltskin was somewhat troubled by lack of disappoinment in Baroconsi's face but was joyous and said.{nl}[Yes, you admitted yourself. I am the owner of this place! So I win! Haha!]
{nl}The demon countered. {nl}[Even if that is true, you've said it yourself, I will be the master in one year. That means, the gold veins become mine.{nl}And furthermore, you are bound by your own words that you will not be able to mine any gold from here. That means, I de facto own them.]

You must master the flute to learn the techniques of a Pied Piper.{nl}This is the most difficult step in the apprenticeship.
I've built a Drill Ground on Altar Way to assist the training of my apprentices.{nl}Training there has helped them master the flute.

Repetitious training can at times be exhausting.{nl}But one day you will come to see how far you've progressed.
Revelator, your skills are improving at an astounding rate.{nl}It amazes me to see how quickly you've improved.
It seems that repetition training has worn you down.{nl}Why don't we try again some other time when you're feeling better?

Assassin Master
Assassins carry around with them various items made using the plant Hasisas.{nl}It can strengthen your body and also allow you to take advantage of the enemy depending on how it's used.{nl}
When you are not used to the effects of such items, you are as good as dead on the battlefield.{nl}This is the easiest mistake a budding Assassin can make, one that puts one's own life at risk.{nl}
So I often tend to new Assassins to help them train...{nl}How about it? Are you interested?
You've come back.{nl}Training under the influence is not an easy task.{nl}
Do you want to try training again?
This is a potion brewed using Hasisas.{nl}Go to Pasagos Cliff in Ramstis Ridge and drink the potion.
Drinking the potion will make shadowy apparitions appear before you.{nl}What you need to do is defeat them when they appear.{nl}
I know you're wondering what the purpose of this training is.{nl}Hasisas does not permanently enhance your physical strength.{nl}
Enhancing your physique can take a toll on the mind.{nl}An Assassin must be strong of both mind and body because of that.
Hasisas can be used for different purposes depending on how it's brewed.{nl}However, you must be familiar with the brewing process and methods of consumption.
I've underestimated you. I'm impressed.{nl}But remember that it will be much harder to pull off in an actual fight.
It's always important to take care of one's health, even if you're an Assassin.{nl}I'd say you need to rest for a bit.
There's nothing that can hold us, Outlaws, back.{nl}But do remember that you can end up dead when you don't have what it takes.{nl}If you want to be one of us, you've gotta pay your dues.{nl}Visit the Seir Rainforest. I've prepared training grounds in Odur Backyard.
To train, pick up the rocks and sand laying about on the grounds and 
use Brick Smash while standing behind the monster
use Throw Sand while standing in front of the monster
to debuff monsters and defeat them with normal attacks. You will earn 1 point for each kill.{nl}The training grounds can be found in Odur Backyard at the Seir Rainforest.
