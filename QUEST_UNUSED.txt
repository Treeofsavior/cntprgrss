That was close. My name is Kupole Meile.{nl}I came to guide the petrified souls in this place.{nl}But I'm afraid more Petrifying Frost like the one from before will suddenly appear, so I haven't been able to move much.
{nl}There are Petrification Detectors, but it seems some of them aren't working...{nl}Will you inspect the detectors for me?
A long time ago demons and goddesses kept their powers to themselves.{nl}They kept from interfering in each other's areas.{nl}Then one day the demons casted this petrification curse.
Petrification detectors were installed throughout the area.{nl}The first one you saw earlier seems to be working, but you should have a look at the others.
If only all the detectors were working...
Oh, I see.{nl}So two of them aren't working.
Problems with the detectors are best reported to the Royal Army.{nl}They're the ones who installed them.{nl}Royal Army Officer Retia should be able to help, I think.
After the demons cast the petrification curse on this land... the goddesses did try to save us.{nl}But the demons were furious about them interfering with their work and left for another region...
{nl}The disaster they caused was unimaginable...{nl}It was so bad it forced the goddesses to give up on saving this petrified land...
Retia is at Verkti Square.{nl}Hm? You already knew?
The Petrification Detectors at the Coastal Fortress aren't working.{nl}I'm aware of that. They were broken.
Isn't someone there, though? I sent some backup to fix the broken detectors.{nl}It's been a while since they left, too... I wonder what happened...
{nl}Will you look for them?
Seeing how there's no news of them, though... Something could have happened.{nl}I know it isn't easy, but if you find their bodies... will you look through them?{nl}They should be carrying useful parts. If not, try the monsters nearby...
The Petrifying Frost at the entrance to Coastal Fortress is being reported on quite often, so you should be careful of monster attacks and Petrifying Frost.
The backup forces are all gone... It's a shame...{nl}Their spirits will need to be guided too...
Okay. Anyways, please take those parts and fix the broken detector.{nl}We should do it, but please understand that we can't leave here.
Those are the parts.{nl}You should go and fix the detectors now.{nl}Beware of Petrifying Frost.
After all the detectors are back to normal I want to guide the spirits to their rest place.
Please, do me this favor.
Oh, all of them are working now.{nl}Thank you.{nl}I can finally start guiding the spirits now.
I'm worried there's so many spirits...{nl}But I still plan to guide them one by one.{nl}May your path be blessed by the goddesses.
Who're you? Stay back.{nl}Or... Maybe if you can help me...
Priest Juta
Wow. I never thought I'd meet someone at this cemetery.{nl}I'm a Bokor serving Goddess Zemyna. After she went missing I followed Her trace all the way here.{nl}
I heard Goddess Zemyna was hiding and that she had blessed the Order of the Tree of Truth,{nl}but now that I'm here all I see are dead bodies.{nl}I can't control them with my power, either. I might have to get rid of them, they're interfering with my prayers...
Really? Thank you for your words.{nl}Prayers were hard to do alone.{nl}
Please take care of the bodies around here, then.{nl}Meanwhile I'll be preparing and praying to the goddess.
I thought I'd find something here, but these corpses don't respond to my Bokor powers...{nl}I never saw something like this. I need to find the goddess...
Oh, you're back. Thanks to you I was able to pray properly.{nl}I mean... There's no answer like before but...
I'll inspect them.

I want you to get rid of the boss monsters at Mage Tower.{nl}We don't have enough workforce to reconstruct Fedimian and the monsters are also coming out from the tower.
According to the report of the scout who succeeded in infiltrating into the tower, it was Minotaurus at the 3rd floor of Mage Tower.{nl}If we could defeat that monster, it will be an enough warning.
Well Done. The monsters' force has reduced a bit as a result. {nl}Please pass my appreciation to Archer Master.
Thanks. {nl}As a Cleric Master, I will help you to fulfill bigger mission.

So you are the Revelator who dreamt of the dream of the goddesses.{nl}I am Uska, the Knight Commander in charge of both Siauliai and Klaipeda.
The kingdom lost all hope.{nl}Without the will to stand up again.. calling at the name of the goddesses.{nl}
To tell you the truth, I can't just see you Revelators positively.{nl}Since I am in charge of one city..{nl}
We should not experience the depression again.
Anyways, the bishop also dreamt of the revelation.{nl}He told me that when the Revelator comes, he should go to Crystal Mine.{nl}
But, since the mine village is fighting against Vubbes, we are restricting the entrance.{nl}The knight, Aras at the east forest is in charge so meet him.
The reason why the number of monsters increased in this forest was due to Vubbe fighters.{nl}Please find out how many Vubbes are here.{nl}
Hey. You're that famous Revelator, aren't ya?{nl}Seems like you're interested in the Fortress of the Land.{nl}
This is, the place is full of soldiers from the Royal Army, you can't just walk in.{nl}Now. Whose side are you on?{nl}If you want to enter the Fortress of the Land, you better tell me.{nl}
Be careful not to get detected by kingdom soldiers.{nl}Even if you get caught, just laugh and pretend there's nothing.
You've seen Gargoyle Sculpture at the gathering place right?{nl}That's the Gargoyle.{nl}
Strangely, whenever I tried to enter the fortress, it suddenly moves and blocks the way.{nl}Without making a mess, it will be impossible to suppress them with our force.
Poata at the east forest of Siauliai are threatening the villagers.{nl}If you could eliminate them in the name of the goddesses, I will teach you my magic.
When I saw you for the first time, you looked too awkward.. but.{nl}Now, you became more famous than me.{nl}
Well done.{nl}When you gain some experiences and learn swordsmanship from me, you will become a good knight.
You've come here to learn the teaching of Rogue from me?{nl}It's good.{nl}There is a task that I can verify your skills as a Rogue and resolve my problem.{nl}
Scout Master and I used to be very good friends, but our relationship is somewhat awkward now.{nl}I want to restore the relationship by giving him a gift, but if I go, I am going to get spotted.{nl}Can you go there secretly and leave him a gift?
Good. But this also includes your test.{nl}Give him a gift, but you have to put it secretly so Scout Master doesn't notice you.{nl}To give you an advice, you do it from his back.
So you've come.{nl}He will be surprised when he checks it later.{nl}
It is now time to complete my work with you.{nl}I can see that you are more than average since you were able to put it secretly without Scout Master noticing it. You will learn fast.
So you've come here to learn the skills of Fletcher.{nl}Remember, it would also cost you a lot.{nl}
I've been looking for the arrows that were created by the first Fletcher Master from long time ago.{nl}Those arrows were to be given to Lydia Schaffen so I am sure the expertise that was put into those arrows are not normal.{nl}I've found the whereabouts of those arrows recently so someone who would be able to recognize the true value of those arrows should go there.
According to the information I've obtained, it looks like I would be able to find it from 36_1 of the valley region.{nl}It was used to hunt for some violent monster so you better be careful.
I can tell it's great by just looking at its appearances.{nl}I want to research on this arrow immediately, but my promise with you come first.{nl}I will show you my skill so pay attention.
As a Falconer Master, I am looking for the ways to make Falconers stronger with diverse methods.{nl}One of the ideas that came to me was to use the aerial monsters instead of eagles.{nl}
Of course, I am satisfied with my partner, Rith, but I think these tries would help Falconer.
Like when you are taming an eagle, how about feed it?{nl}I don't have high expectations so you better go there and try it first.{nl}I've put enough food so at least try on three different kinds of monsters.
Did we fail. It's so bad, but I've expected it.{nl}Regardless of the outcomes, I will pay for your efforts.{nl}Good. I will teach you myself.
You want to learn more advanced skills?{nl}If you want to learn advanced skills of Schwaze Reiter, your should possess competent skills.{nl}The most important thing is to shoot enemies accurately.
I like your confidence.{nl}But, I should check whether youa re really competent enough.{nl}I will acknowledge you if you succeed landing hits on enemies 200 times consecutively without any mistake.
So you were not a bluff.{nl}I would be pleasant to teach you if your skills are like those.
You've come here to learn the skills of Monk?{nl}That's good. I can trust you.{nl}There's something I need to request to you.{nl}
I still regret for what I did in the past.{nl}I am helping some peolpe as a result, but if it becomes known to other people, I will be in a trouble.{nl}You have to send them a gift, if you do it well, I will teach you some skills.
There are lots of people who blame me.{nl}But, I am not doing this task for those people.{nl}I am just taking my responsibility for my mistake.
Have you passed it well?{nl}Then, you just have to learn from me.
You've come here to get acknowledged by me?{nl}But, I have some matter to take care of now so it's little hard at the moment.{nl}The book of transactions has been ripped off due to the monsters.{nl}{nl}Because of this, I can't concentrate on other works.{nl}If you are in a hurry, then I will tell you the location so please get me the preliminary book.{nl}This is a secret, but I am telling you because of our relationship and I trust you.
The preliminary book is at 35_3 at the monastery.{nl}In order to prevent other people from finding it, I've hid it inside a book and there are some fake books as well so find it well.
You've found it well.{nl}Now, since we've taken care of urgent matter, I will acknowledge you with this.
In order to control the abilities of Druid well, you should know well about the plants you control.{nl}I am actually researching on the occurence which the over grown plants turned into monsters so you may learn something from it.{nl}If you help me with this, I will acknowledge it as your training.
Defeat the plants that turned into monsters and obtain some samples from them.{nl}You will be able to obtain more samples as the monsters get stronger.
It seems that you are competent enough.{nl}As I promised to you, I will help you.
It seems that you have some business with me, but there is more important thing to do at the moment.{nl}The demonic power which was created from a far place is becoming stronger and begins to influence the power of Oracle.{nl}As a result, what we see through Clairvoyance is getting vague.{nl}
We have to get rid of that demonic energy first.{nl}Why don't you try it first?{nl}Maybe, resolving this issue would verify your competence and can also be a test for you.
The problem is occuring at Canyon Region 36_1.{nl}You just have to put the Romuva of Purification where the demonic energy is strong.
It seems that you've done well.{nl}It was a good decision for me to give the task to you.{nl}Okay then, I will help you from now on.
Good. Take this object and go to Mochia Forest.{nl}When you find someone, talk naturally and you have to tell him the passwords.
Demon Svitrigaila
Finally... You have come.{nl}Someone else besides miss Giltine...{nl}
I have a request to you.{nl}Lead me to a death.
Writings on the Pillar
[Cleros' background]
{nl}Cleros was born the eldest son to a noble family, but saw his succession rights stolen by his stepmother's children, who expelled him from their land. This can be said to be his first recorded misfortune.
{nl}He left to find work near the border under an acquaintance's suggestion. The job turned out to be a scam; he was imprisoned and forced to work to exhaustion.
{nl}With the help of Ruklys, he escaped his life of near-slavery, after which he took up martial arts and lived a period of peace. Ruklys was persecuted, however, and soon Cleros was back to misery.
[The death of Cleros]
{nl}{nl}After a long string of misfortunes living as a runaway with no achievements to be told of, he was finally arrested and taken to Kalejimas.
{nl}I wish I could say there was hope for him at that infamous prison, but his life there was nothing but hardship until the end.
[After the death of Cleros]
{nl}{nl}One may think, while his life may have been plagued with misfortune, it certainly wasn't particularly arduous. But, according to what is said, even in death his spirit is being tormented by demons, unable to escape his sad situation.
{nl}Some believe the fact that he is still suffering at the hands of the demons means there must be a secret about his life we don't know of.
Writings on the Pillar
[Rumpelstiltskin and the Moon]
{nl}{nl}This may not be absolutely true, but this is a story that's been told by legends. What we know is that Rumpelstiltskin made a bet with Lydia Schaffen and rode her arrow headed to the moon for ages and ages.
{nl}His trip to the moon took a very long time and was very difficult. But when he finally reached the moon, Rumpelstiltskin realized his problem. The arrow he had been riding to the moon could hardly be called an arrow anymore, given its state after the trip.
He was surprised by the fact that the arrow he had been riding (he was only sitting on it, it was flying with his own magic) was suddenly completely worn out.
[Rumpelstiltskin and Lydia Schaffen's Arrow]
{nl}{nl}Of course the arrow could have become worn out over such a long trip, but instead it happened all of a sudden after Rumpelstiltskin landed on the moon, which seemed very odd.
{nl}It turns out what happened to the arrow was Rumpelstiltskin's fault. His magic did fly the arrow to the moon and kept it protected, but what he didn't know was that Lydia Schaffen's arrow was made of a material used against demons. And so, while his magic kept the arrow unscathed all the way to the moon, upon letting go of the arrow, which was being held together solely by magic, it immediately crumbled into a lump of rust and fell to the ground.
[Rumpelstiltskin's Whereabouts]
{nl}{nl}Rumpelstiltskin thought long and hard and finally figured it out, but it was too late. Of course no human, goddess or demon can confirmed this story, as it exists only in legends. As far as we know, Rumpelstiltskin may as well still be on his way to the moon.
{nl}Or, he could be wandering about in our world, looking for any other arrows Lydia Schaffen might have left behind.
Leopoldas
A Revelator!{nl}It's nice to meet you. My name is Leopoldas, I manage the new members of the Kedorlaomer Merchants. I'm really glad to meet you here.
{nl}Since we've been introduced, shall we... maybe have a chat?
Our merchants?{nl}Since you are interested, shall I tell you?
{nl}To tell you the truth, the world needs our merchants.{nl}Not sure if you know,{nl}but we kept the Crystal Mine alive by buying minerals off it,{nl}we supplied materials to build the Astral Tower, the Great Cathedral, the Earth Tower and so much more.
{nl}That's right. We're the ones who did all of that.{nl}Surprised?
It'd be great if you could give our merchants a hand here in Manahas, if you have the time.{nl}Over there are our newcomers, and if you go South you can help out Jurathena Margellius.{nl}You'll be proud to call yourself an assistant to the Kedorlaomer Merchants!
Even in our group, though, we did have our rough times.{nl}It's actually a bit rough right now.{nl}That's why we're focusing on this here right now.
See ya next time.
Ah, I think I know what sacred object is there.{nl}Instead of using a tool, first dig it with your hand.{nl}And be careful not to break the object and bring it to me.
It shouldn't be that hard.
Be careful not to break it.
This is the bottle which contains the secret ink which was used to write important recordings or documents.{nl}It's used to hide records and the like.{nl}Thank you.
Antanas
Greetings.{nl}I'm Antanas, from the Rud Order.{nl}In this day and age with the goddesses gone, instead of fighting other orders, we at the Rud Order prefer to quietly wait for the goddesses while we do our work.
{nl}We're building a sanctuary here.{nl}We need to look for materials for it, but we seem to be rather short of hands.{nl}Would you help?
I'm here building the sanctuary, but there are others out there gathering materials to make scriptures, looking for records of ancient sages of the Rud Order or doing other tasks.
There's two things we need.{nl}Listen closely. {nl}Get some lime powder from monsters, and then some flat stones for construction.
{nl}You'll be busy.
Good luck!
Wow, you did great.
That.. is that from the monsters of the Fortress of the Land?{nl}Ruklys army used to have it in the past.{nl}
The object that you've brought will aid us in our research.{nl}Can you get us some more?
I didn't expect the monsters at the Fortress of the Land have this..{nl}This is very interesting.
This is enough. {nl}Thank you for helping our research.
What's up?{nl}Are you giving this to me?{nl}
This is surprising. It's telling all about the lives of past soldiers.{nl}I should send this to the headquarters. Thank you.
No!{nl}Please don't take it away from me..
That's a bomb.. Is that a blind shell?{nl}Can I take a look at it?
This is very old!{nl}These kind of bombs can only be seen in the books.
Soldier Spirit
I wasn't able to send an order to retreat.{nl}I should have blown the horn...
If they don't retreat we're going to be annihilated.{nl}The horn...
Thank you. Where do you belong to?{nl}I should get back to Ruklys now.
Wait! Listen to what he is saying.{nl}He's saying if I want to get our family treasure back, I should give him the blessed crystal.{nl}
He has given us fake crystals at first and took away one's life.{nl}And he is asking to call a dead person and ask him.{nl}
So I asked him how I can call it out and he told me to use the scroll for the dead to him.{nl}So I asked him how much it would cost and he answered that I can pay him by giving him some Blue Paint.
I'm sure this man will attempt to run away whilst I'm searching for Blue Paint!{nl}Can you help me?
Sorry. I guess I was too upset. I will tell you slowly. {nl}I'm a friend of Squire Master, Justina Legwyn.{nl}
The dead person which the Pardoner is talking about is the father of my friend, Gailus Legwyn.{nl}It is ridiculous that missing Gailus Legwyn has passed away, and look at his attitude.{nl}
That old man only wants to satisfy his greed.{nl}Poor Justina...{nl}
You can find Blue Paint from the monsters at Apgaudin Crossroads.{nl}I'm counting on you.
Does she know the value of the Dead Scroll?{nl}Whatever... I don't care anymore.{nl}
I'm experiencing this shame because of him. I can't stand it anymore.{nl}Find Gailus Legwyn with this and ask him yourself!{nl}
Look for the seal of Mires Grave{nl}I hear he died near there.
He doesn't want to back off until he receives the blessed crystal back.{nl}He is so tenacious.
Oh my, goddess!{nl}I didn't expect that I would meet a human here..{nl}
Please help me.{nl}I'm being chased by the chasers and the demons from the tower of the stars.{nl}
Can you stand by me until I notify my other colleagues using a signal flare?{nl}I have to let the other two colleagues who came here know that I am still alive.
Chasers came here..{nl}I might have been in danger if it wasn't for you.
You.. It's like as if the goddesses are beside you.{nl}Okay. I am sure you are better than that Giltine.{nl}
I am the Demon Lord Hauberk.{nl}Maybe you've already met me and my other piece.{nl}But, that piece is a different piece. I don't know who you are..{nl}
I was running away from the demons through a human called Agatas.{nl}But, Agatas is dying due to the paralysis needle of the demon.{nl}
I know that you don't trust me.{nl}But, please save this pilgrim.{nl}If you can find some Dark Blue Herbs, you can save him.
(Seems to be unconscious)
You can save Agatas with this.{nl}There's nothing I can pay for your kindness.{nl}
I just look like a demon that should be eliminated in your eyes right?{nl}But, when Agatas wakes up, he will explain everything to you.
The Knights of Kaliss? Good. {nl}We can't completely trust you just yet but, if you help me with the plan, I can take you with me.{nl}
You know the Fortress of the Land was Ruklys' last battlefield, right?{nl}It was excavated from the ground like a tunnel.{nl}
The Royal Army are all over it now, protecting it.{nl}Isn't it weird?
The revolt occurred 400 years ago and we don't have enough workforce due to Medzio Diena.{nl}This city too.. I know that it's historically meaningful, but I am not sure if we have to protect it that much.{nl}
Maybe some black deals were going back and forth behind the kingdom.{nl}If that's not it, why are they protecting this?{nl}
They must be wondering what's going on since the Knights of Kaliss are here.{nl}They said they'd turn a blind eye on me if only I bring them what they want.{nl}
So, of course I'm getting inside the fortress room that's full of treasures without the army knowing.{nl}I imagine it's loaded with riches, sinceit's the army's funds.{nl}
First, gather the records from Ruklys' era in the assembly area.{nl}We need them to get pass the guarding Gargoyle.
Bokor Juta
I'm looking for Goddess Zemyna.{nl}Everyone knows the goddess is missing.{nl}
I've come here after hearing that the goddesses blessed the Order of the Tree of Truth...{nl}I can only see the deads.{nl}
If you are going to stay in this chamber, can you help me?{nl}I can't do anything with my power and they come at me whenever they hear my prayers.{nl}
I should pray to the goddesses to check whether she is around here.
Really? Thank you for your words.{nl}Prayers were hard to do alone.{nl}
Then I am counting on you for the deads at the casket room.{nl}I will pray to the goddess in the meantime.
I thought I would be able to find the whereabouts of Goddess Zemyna here, but this place is full of the dead..{nl}I've never seen this. We should look for Zemyna fast.
Ah, so you've returned. {nl}Because of you, the deads didn't attack me while I was praying.{nl}
But, even here, the prayer didn't reach the goddess.

So you are the famous Revelator, right?{nl}Hmm... I have something to suggest to you. Why don't you work with me?{nl}
You know that Fortress of the Land was the last place where the Ruklys' army resisted, right?{nl}But, not only that. What I am going to tell you from now on is a secret... I have a question before that.{nl}
Whose side are you on?{nl}The Royal Army or the Knights of Kaliss?{nl}If you don't want to answer, then just do what you are told.
[The Life of Cleros]
{nl}Cleros is the elder son of some landlord.{nl}He lost the right of succession to the child of stepmother and was expelled out of the land.{nl}
His life which is full of failures started like that.{nl}He began to look for another job as a result of his friend's advice.
But, that was the plan to sell Cleros.{nl}He became a slave that has to work till the death while being locked inside.{nl}
While he was locked inside, he received the salvation of Ruklys.{nl}His life as a slave was now over, but the peaceful days weren't going to last long.{nl}
When Ruklys was defeated, his rest turned into a disaster.
{nl}A long escape continued.{nl}He didn't succeed in anything in his life.{nl}
And he was caught and locked inside Kalejimas.{nl}It would've been good if there was any hope in that prison..{nl}
But, he experienced agony there and died.
{nl}If the story ends here, this will be the story of some person who failed his life.{nl}
But, according to some info, he is still being tortured by the demon.{nl}His spirit.{nl}
As a result, there are people who say there's some hidden story behind his life.{nl}But, no one knows what the story is.{nl}
{nl}{nl}Look for the small dot which goes after the night sky.{nl}That's Rumpelstiltskin flying towards the moon.{nl}
As we know, Rumpelstiltskin made a bet with Lydia Schaffen and flew to the moon.{nl}It took him ages and ages.{nl}
About halfway there, Rumpelstiltskin was suddenly surprised beyond belief.{nl}The arrow he had been riding was almost completely destroyed.
{nl}Rumpelstiltskin realized he had been tricked.{nl}Of course, the arrow could have disintegrated from flying for so long.{nl}
However, it was Rumpelstiltskin's own magic that was at fault.{nl}You see, Lydia Schaffen's arrow had been made to possess power against demons.{nl}
That's right. Rumpelstiltskin was a demon.{nl}So when his power and the power of the arrow collided, it started to disintegrate.{nl}
Rumpelstiltskin, who has just realized that, was furious, but it was to no use.
{nl}Rumpelstiltskin, unable to return to earth, is still flying towards the moon.{nl}Or, he could just as well be back already, searching for more of Lydia's arrows.{nl}
This story can't be verified by humans, goddesses, nor demons.{nl}Of course, it would become apparent if we would be able to go to the moon.
What, aren't you the Revelator?{nl}It's so good to see you.{nl}
Of course, I know about you.{nl}We of the Kedora Merchant Alliance know everything.{nl}
We're a distinguished alliance; we worked on the Astral Tower, the Great Cathedral and other major constructions.{nl}Will of the goddesses. I'd say we were a sort of driving force in history.{nl}
Oh, I'm in charge of the new members by the way.{nl}After Medzio Diena we had to use even the newcomers to help with reconstruction.{nl}
How about we help each other out?{nl}He is the helper of our Kedora Merchant Alliance.
Thank you so much.{nl}The newcomers are beside me.{nl}
I was going to be a little strict teaching you, but that's not really me.{nl}I was wondering if you could give us a hand.{nl}
If you go south you can help out Jurathena Margellius.{nl}The monsters around here are tough even for a veteran.
Even in our group, though, we did have our rough times.{nl}It's actually a bit rough right now.{nl}
That's why we're focused here on Manahas right now.
Alright, go then.{nl}It shouldn't be too hard for someone of your fame.
Greetings.{nl}I'm Antanas, from Nestospa. {nl}Have you ever seen Nestospa?{nl}Well, it doesn't matter if you haven't.
{nl}The people of Nestospa here are just quietly doing their work.{nl}Myself, I'm here making tombstones.{nl}The problem is I have no materials.{nl}Would you help me?
Antanas told you to go?{nl}I'm Giedra, from Nestospa.{nl}If you already met Antanas, you probably know what we do by now, so I'll keep it short.
{nl}I'm gathering materials to make scriptures of the goddesses.{nl}Regular paper gets yellow and falls apart too quickly... so I'm looking for a material that won't get wet or change color. {nl}Transparent monster shells are perfect for this, since they last a long time after they're carved.{nl}Will you gather some for me?
You're back faster than I thought.{nl}I'll use these shells to make the scriptures.{nl}Thank you.
Oh, my sign... Without it there's no telling if I'm Nestospa or Anastospa...{nl}I lost everything... The monsters took everything...{nl}I'm done...{nl}I was going to Fasika Plateau after my pilgrimage but...
Oooohh!{nl}Please help me!{nl}My Nestospa sign is gone!
{nl}It's gone, gone, gone!{nl}Please help me find it!{nl}The monsters must have taken it!
How could this happen...{nl}I'm  done... How am I going to face my Nestospa mentors...
That's it!{nl}Wow, you found them all!{nl}Thank you!{nl}How can I ever repay you...
It is very surprising. What soldiers did in the past is written here. {nl}I am going to pass this document to the headquarters. {nl}
I will give you a copy of the book as a token of my appreciation.{nl}It is written roughly, but our objective is to find out the truth in the past.
Ruklys Army Soldier's Spirit
If we don't make an order to retreat, they will all be annihilated.{nl}Please blow the horn..
The Knights of Kaliss? Good. {nl}The Fortress of the Land can't be entered since there are too many Royal Army guards.{nl}But, if you help me with the plan, I can take you with me.{nl}
About the secret I told you a while ago...{nl}
I heard some saying that the Fortress of the Land is to protect the treasure which was received from Ruklys.{nl}
Think about it. Isn't it strange?{nl}The Royal Army guards are protecting the hole which is digged like a ant hole.{nl}
The Knights of Kaliss wants to know if something is there.{nl}They told us that if we investigate the Fortress of the Land, they won't say anything regardless of what we do.{nl}
Ah, of course, I am going to go look for the treasure of Ruklys.{nl}The treasure is from the goddesses so it must be something amazing.{nl}
Anyways, you are going to be with me right?{nl}Please first gather the records from Ruklys Era at the gathering place.{nl}In order to break Gargoyle, we need that.
Hey, you.{nl}What are you doing here in this far off forest?{nl}Well, it doesn't matter. Whoever you are, can you give me a hand?
My name is Druid Leja and I live in this forest.{nl}I've reached here by chasing after the ferrets that ran away with the food from the village.{nl}I wasn't able to find the food, but instead was attacked by ferrets.{nl}
I want to cure my wound before I go back to the village..{nl}When we go up there, there is a herb that works well on wounds. Please bring us those herbs.
When we collect the herbs, the ferrets may attack us.{nl}They think everything in this forest belongs to them.
Revelator, have you drank the red water before?{nl}If you had drank it before, I am sure you won't be able to talk to me now.{nl}Even if you are really thirsty, you shouldn't drink the red water. If you drink it, you will suffer from it.{nl}It is so toxic. The fruits that grew by consuming the water got huge and can't be edible.{nl}
I was once lost in a forest and I was really thirsty at then.{nl}I found a container with fruit juice in it which the ferrets had accumulated.{nl}Dying from thirst or dying from the ferrets, dying is the same.{nl}So I drank the juice without the ferrets knowing and nothing happened to me.{nl}
We're almost running out of the water we had collected, we need to find more.{nl}Could you get some fruit juice from the ferrets? Thank you.
The taste of the fruit juice was way better than I expected...
Wow, thanks. We wouldn't have to worry about the drinkable water with this much amount.
Ah.. I didn't expect I would see a human here..! Please help me!{nl}I am called Druid Benes. I am trying to find the reason why the ferrets are coopering with the demons.{nl}Recently, I found out that I will be able to talk to the ferrets using the spell of the Druids.{nl}
The problem is, since I've been around them for so long, they already know my smell.{nl}Even when I turn into a ferret, they recognize me and refuse to talk to me.{nl}Would you turn into a ferret for me and try and find out what they're plotting?{nl}
In order to turn into a Ferret, you should observe the behaviors of ferrets well.{nl}If we do something awkward, we will get discovered by ferrets.{nl}I am going to give you an empty scroll so please observe the behaviors of ferrets and record them here.
From what you observed, I am going to make a Ferret Transformation Scroll.{nl}So please write in details as much as possible. So that even if it transforms, it doesn't look awkward.
You've observed in details.{nl}You won't have a problem if you transform now.{nl}Please wait.

Ah... a human in this place...{nl}There are demons here. You better run away.{nl}A while ago, demons appeared from up there and are controlling the monsters.
Are you insane?{nl}I don't know how strong you are, but I will stay here so if you want to go, please go alone.{nl}The place where I saw demons was the place where the owl sculpture is located..
I've been chased by demons and ran here from the castle.{nl}I don't want to experience any more troubles.
No demons were there and only other monsters?{nl}That's fortunate I guess.{nl}
You're stronger than you look.{nl}I wasn't expecting that.
Please come back to me when you fix the detector.{nl}I have something to tell you.
I am going to guide each and every one of you with sincerity.{nl}I hope the road ahead of you is full of blessings.
It doesn't matter anymore.{nl}I just want to take a break...
[Ordeal of Cleros]
The sun of gold ray, the moon of silver ray and the land of bronze ray.{nl}What is your number.{nl}
It seems you don't know anything about our merchants.{nl}
Hmm, have you ever seen the Great Cathedral or Mage Tower before?{nl}Or something like the gigantic Goddess Statue of Fedimian?{nl}
Do you think a large construction like that can be completed by one individual?{nl}Of course not. It's hard to supply such materials even if the kingdom comes first.
We are the merchants that supplied materials to the historic construction.{nl}Do you understand now?{nl}
We helped for the completion of it.{nl}The objective of our merchants is the will of the goddesses.{nl}
Ah, I am in charge of newcomers of Kedora Merchant Alliance.{nl}We've received severe damages on Medzio Diena so even the newcomers are trying their best to restore the place.{nl}
We are in a trouble.{nl}We have to put up a notice board, but we're just too busy.{nl}
The Kedora Merchant Alliance act harsh on newcomers.{nl}Especially Leopoldas, he's really scary... He wants me to do this alone.
If that's so, can you place this notice board on Kluibe Road?{nl}Edita, our leader, is excavating this sacred object.{nl}
I am counting on you to do this secretly without being detected by Leopoldas.{nl}I have to go somewhere.
I am counting on you to do this secretly without being detected by Leopoldas.{nl}For sure.
I am helping the Revelators who have just started their journeys from the Kedora Merchant Alliance.{nl}If you don't mind, can you help us?
It's not that difficult.{nl}You just have to pass the blessing which is needed for their journeys.
Thank you.{nl}Then, I will tell you how you can do it.{nl}
Please look for the Revelators who have started their journeys around Orsha or Klaipeda.{nl}When you use this scroll on them, they will receive a helpful blessing for their journeys.
Ah, it won't be effective to ones who have already been blessed, so please keep that in mind.
We can't just rely on the goddess.{nl}We should do it ourselves in order to reduce the burden on the goddesses.
We, Kedora Merchant Alliance helped the goddesses secretly until now.{nl}But, since the world turned into a chaos, we are going to help her actively.
We are in trouble...{nl}There are so many things to retrieve, but I don't know what people are doing.
Ah, so Leopoldas sent you here?{nl}Finally, it seems he has stopped being so stubborn.{nl}
A long time ago, I was sending the sacred objects to Fedimian.{nl}But, I didn't realise it was on Medzio Diena.{nl}
It was such a mess.{nl}They took care of urgent matters in other regions and they now came out to retrieve the sacred objects.{nl}
Okay, let's stop complaining. I want you to retrieve the sacred objects from Goanar Path.{nl}I believe that they are buried deep in the ground.{nl}
Ah, and there are many monsters around that threaten us merchants.{nl}If it's alright with you, I want you to defeat them as well.
Be careful since there are many monsters around there.{nl}If there weren't any monsters, our task would not have been completed this late.
Leopoldas never asks anyone for help.{nl}I never knew that you were this good.
Actually, we received a strange report.{nl}The monsters at Kluibe Road are digging only one spot.
I think what they are looking for is one of our Merchants' object.{nl}And it would take some time until the retrieval group reaches here.
Is it the sacred object?{nl}It's been such a long time so I can't think of anything else.
Those are the records from the merchants.{nl}They are badly torn.{nl}
I am sure the monsters created this mess.{nl}Give it to me.
Let's see.{nl}It is about..{nl}
This is the book about the materials for the arrow.{nl}Long time ago, they were supplied to Lydia Schaffen and the first Fletcher Master.{nl}
I thought it was the sacred object that was lost long ago, it's an unexpected gift.{nl}It is said that the arrow of Lydia Schaffen has some special power in it.{nl}
It is hard to restore it myself.. {nl}I should put it somewhere in the safe place and restore it when I go back to the headquarter.
The remaining spot should be somewhere around Juikas Field.. but, I have no idea where it is exactly.{nl}If it's alright with you, could you help me out with this?
I will give you the detector so please see how it reacts to it.{nl}It will only react on the marks that were put on by merchants so you won't get lost.
Isn't this really a good method?{nl}We put marks on all objects of the Merchants just in case they happened to get lost.
Ahah, you've found the most important object!{nl}This is the mysterious ink.{nl}
This is the secret ink which you use when you have to hide the records.{nl}It is very expensive as a result.{nl}
You've been a great help to me so far.{nl}We will take care of the rest!{nl}
Leopoldas?{nl}Ah, he is our brother. What's the matter?{nl}
He sent you to help me?{nl}I can't believe it.{nl}
Well, anyways, it's good.{nl}That damn monster took away everything.{nl}
Other things are fine, but the problem is the teaching materials for the newcomers.{nl}If we don't have those, we have to work from the beginning.{nl}
You've seen the newcomers who Leopoldas manages right?{nl}These are the documents to educate those newcomers.{nl}
Well, we, merchants support the will of the goddesses, but we moved secretly from behind.{nl}But, we can't stand anymore since the world is like this.
That's why we've decided to hire new people and participate more actively.{nl}But, since the world is like this, we can't just do nothing.{nl}
Anyways, if you are going to help me, please get me those documents again.{nl}If we don't have those, it would become complicated.
It's not going to be over even if we find all those documents.{nl}Get ready since we also have to create the manuscript.
I know the good meaning of it, but I am not sure if we are going to survive.{nl}If so, we are not doing something that we hadn't done before so it doesn't matter.{nl}
Fighting against monsters are not something rare.
Good. Our brother send us a good helper.{nl}Let's make the manuscript now.
I will do the writing anyways so you don't have to worry.{nl}What I need is the ink.{nl}
If there's an ink that is made up the body fluid from the monsters, it would last long.{nl}I will give you the trap so I am counting on you for the monster body fluid.
Put the trap on the way that monsters cross.{nl}When monsters faint out after stepping on the trap, get the body fluid.{nl}
Ah, this is the trick that only works at Droze Empty Lot so you should only put the trap there.
You've already obtained all of them?{nl}
I knew it. We still need more.
This is enough.{nl}You've done well so far.{nl}
If we meet next time, I will treat you a lot from our merchants,.{nl}I will do the rest so go back.
Hello.{nl}Have you ever heard of Nestospa?{nl}
Well, it doesn't really matter even if we didn't hear anything about it.{nl}They only concentrate on their religious belief quietly.{nl}
I am one of those Nestospa.{nl}Prayers are good, but I am making a tombstone to see if that's going to help the goddesses.{nl}
I am trying to get rid of the evil energy and send only sacred energy to the goddess.{nl}But, I am having a problem collecting materials. {nl}
Can you help me?
There are too many materials.{nl}Listen well.{nl}
Get some lime powder from monsters, and then some flat stones for construction.{nl}You'll be busy.
I can't just stand still even if I can't fact demons directly.{nl}Everyone does his/her own task.
Goold. Well done.{nl}Now the materials are all collected.. We need some special tools.
Good. Since you've helped me until now, why don't you make a tombstone yourself?{nl}Your name will be reached to the goddess with the sacred power.{nl}
Just do your best to make a shape.{nl}How about it? Do you want to try it?
Make it beautiful.{nl}I will do the rest so don't worry too much.
It's quite a nice shape, composed but heavy.{nl}Leave the final touches to me.{nl}
I don't know how many tombstones we are going to make..{nl}But, when you see this kind of tombstone from now on, please remember that there are people like us.{nl}
The kingdom hasn't been collapsed by the demons yet.{nl}If we do our best, we would be able to find the peace.{nl}
Ah, up there, We need help from Giedra near Baderam Hill.{nl}If you are okay, I want you to help me.
Do you have any business with me?{nl}
Antanas has asked you to help me?{nl}That's good. I am compiling the scripture of the goddesses here.{nl}
We should have something that we can rely on when we are facing diffculties like nowadays.{nl}
The scripture helped that.{nl}We should calm us down by reading the words of the goddesses.{nl}
We should first collect the materials to compile the scripture.{nl}Normal sheets become yellow and break.. We are trying to compile it with new materials now.{nl}
Transparent shells of monsters are good.{nl}When we engrave letters on them, they last long.{nl}Could you get me those?{nl}{nl}
Those are easy to find.{nl}Okay, then I am counting on you.
Everyone needs something to rely one.{nl}But the goddesses.. {nl}
Yes.{nl}We should be like a big tree that can be relied on.
You've brought them sooner than I expected.{nl}This shell would become the scripture after polising it up. Thank you.{nl}
To make the scripture, sheets are important, but binding is also important.{nl}Especially, the strings. It will be no good if the scripture gets untied.{nl}
The string that is made up of the leather of monster is the best, but the problem is that it is short.{nl}I will give you a Moru so can you make a leather string for the binding?{nl}
We should first obtain leather strings from monsters.{nl}After that, we will use this Moru to make a string for the binding.{nl}
We will connect short ones to make a long string for the binding.
I've learned the binding from Orsha long time ago.{nl}But, the task is too much with my own power.
Ah! What should I do? what should I do..{nl}Without it, I won't know if I am a Nestos or Anastos.{nl}
I am done. done.{nl}Since the pilgrim is over, I am trying to go to Pasaka Canyon, but I've done it again.{nl}Ahah.. I don't want to do this..
Yes? Ah, I didn't know you were there. I am sorry.{nl}I am now. Ah.. too desperate.{nl}
My luggage is gone.{nl}In fact what's inside are potato dumplings, books and etc, but the sign of Nestos.{nl}
Ah.. really. The sign of Nestos is most important.{nl}That is so important to me.. I am sure the monsters have taken it.
What should I do..{nl}How would I see the faces of Nestospa..
That's it!{nl}Wow, you've collected all of them!{nl}
How can I pay for this?{nl}
I was talking gibberish right?{nl}I am so sorry. I was too desperate so I wanted to give up on everything.{nl}
This sign is like a sacred object to us.{nl}This is the symbol that we gained lots of diverse knowledge and passed many ordeals.{nl}
We should go back.{nl}We won't lose it again right?{nl}
Ah...{nl}Antanas and Giedra keeps them well, but I don't undertand why I am losing them so often.{nl}I think I possess some secret power that pulls monsters..{nl}
Anyways, I will go to Pasaka Canyon now where the masters are present!{nl}Thank you so much!
In order to collect the sacred power, we should possess some necessary tools.{nl}As you can see, I am not a priest who has been training for a long time.{nl}
I've ordered some special hammer and chisel. {nl}Since the due date has reached, can you get me those?
Normal tools won't work.{nl}If they work, I wouldn't have asked for your help.
Did Antanas send you?{nl}His orders are too difficult..{nl}
Other blacksmiths would have problem fulfilling his orders.{nl}Here is the hammer. Are you going to engrave the sacred spell into it?
Chisel?{nl}I don't sell chisels so I've asked someone else to prepare for him.{nl}
Go meet Jura.{nl}She works at the equipment shop.
See you again later.{nl}You are going to repair your equipment here from now on right?
Welcome!{nl}The best equipment shop in Orsha!{nl}
Chisel?{nl}Are you talking about the chisel which Ilanai has given to you?{nl}
Good. Receive it.{nl}I guess your religious belief in the goddesses is strong.
Jura has the chisel.{nl}She works at the equipment shop.
Oh, you've made it well according to the order.{nl}Now, I guess I can get to work.
Do you still have things to order?{nl}You can just take a look around so please visit here often.
Have you found the chisel?{nl}I welcome orders like this so please keep visit our shop.
What do you think?{nl}Why don't you help us if you think eliminating demons is important even if our objectives are different from each other.
First of all, there are many polluted tombstones.{nl}I will break these so I want you to break the polluted tombstone at Usas Hill.{nl}
I think that tombstone is also spurting out the red energies.{nl}Like the tombstone beside. That's the proof of the pollution.
I can't understand.{nl}Albinas? Are you the member of the Anastos?{nl}That doesn't make sense?{nl}
I'm not saying I know everyone from the Anastospa...{nl}But we used to be part of the same Order so I know them well.{nl}
No way, bring him here at once! {nl}I'll have to hear from him myself!
When you have enough stones, go see Eduinas at the Nestospa camp.{nl}He'll use them to make stones for construction.{nl}
Eduinas won't be happy if he finds out you made this tombstone, though.{nl}Just keep that in mind if you want to take responsibility.
While I am polishing up the materials, I don't want to see your face.{nl}How about defeating the monsters that make the place around here messy.
Since everything is done, go back to Damijonas with this.{nl}Do not ever do it again.
You've got it. Now, I will start the recovery.{nl}It is fortunate that the damage wasn't severe.
We and the Anastospa have different opinions, but we are not hostile to each other.{nl}Ever since the unknown name came out, it's apparent that we suspect it.{nl}
And you even broke the tombstone.{nl}Anyways, since you've done your responsibility, I will forgive you.{nl}
Don't you feel it's unfair to just let it go?{nl}Since there's a camp of Anastospa up there, go there and ask.{nl}It's really strange.
Yes, I am Anastos'... yes that's right.{nl}What brought you here?{nl}
Sorry, I can't answer your questions at the moment since I am too busy at the moment..{nl}If you can find my research documents, I may get some spare time...
Instead of blind devotion, a life of eliminating demons and preparing for chaos..{nl}I mean those kind of things.{nl}
This is truly strange.{nl}I should send one of my colleagues to find it out.
Ah, by the way, I am thinking about giving him a flare to prepare for any danger, but{nl}There aren't any adequate flares.{nl}
Can you get us the powders that burn well in the fire?{nl}There are so many monsters around so it won't be hard to obtain the materials.
Let's wait for the investigation results.{nl}He is a competant lad so he will find it out soon.
Since we can't just stand still, how about we find it out ourselves as well?{nl}
Good. Barte may have seen something.{nl}She recently joined our camp.{nl}
How about you ask her about Albinas?{nl}
Albinas?{nl}I saw someone matching your description near Majiva Grave Field.{nl}
When you go back to Majiva Grave Field, that leather may be still there.{nl}I... even if the goddesses tell me to go, I can't since I am too scared.
What's the matter?{nl}I can't think anyone who would use that pattern except for the servant of Baiga.{nl}
We better let other people know this fast.{nl}You let Gedas know!{nl}
Please, save Fabijus!{nl}Ah, before that, we better go back to Nestospa!{nl}
This holy water, please take it.{nl}You will get at least one chance of using it on the demons.{nl}
So you were safe.{nl}I've heard about Albinas from Fabijus.{nl}
Do you think that makes sense?{nl}You broke the well working tombstone and you are saying there is no tombstone?{nl}
What do you want me to say?{nl}I have a headache due to the tombstone so don't talk to me.
It is so fortunate that the divine water I gave to you was helpful.{nl}It gives me goose bumps to think that the demons are within humans and alienate.{nl}
Can you tell Damijonas about this?{nl}I think they must be protecting the broken tombstone near Usas Hill.
I was able to protect the conspiracy of the demons because of you.{nl}I thought we may have been seperated.
Oh. That's right.{nl}Is there anything you found out about Albinas?{nl}
I am sure there are people who fell into their alienating.{nl}They are trying to break them from inside...{nl}
Anyways, thank you.{nl}I hope the goddesses bless you.
Albinas has disappeared! What's going on?
What, Are you interested in the revelation?{nl}But, there arent anything besides those writings...{nl}
First, you bring their attention as Eminent tells you to.{nl}At the same time, let's activate the magic circle at Paramiso Battle Field in secret with me.
You guys should be punished according to kingdom orders in principle.{nl}But, since you've saved our lives and many of our collegues have failed..{nl}
The safety of our colleagues comes first instead of your punishment.{nl}If you could help recapture our headquarters, then I will not question why you've entered here.
I will prepare the magic with the memories of the spirits so you go to Ataka Side Road.{nl}Bring everything you can.{nl}
I've seen the magic circles were activating. You are okay right? {nl}How about Eminent?{nl}
The space which the tyrant who you've asked threw away is probably.. {nl}It is the prison that was made in the era of Kadumel era. {nl}
Restoring the magic circle was the duty of Higgs, but we have no other way since he is injured.{nl}Also everyone is getting tired due to the coldness.. I want to lend your power.
You are better than Higgs.{nl}Can you help us one more time?{nl}
I met the monsters while returning with the message.{nl}I think I can move if I take little more rest, but this message should be delivered fast..{nl}
You seem competent as a swordsman.{nl}Do you have any plans to reach a higher stage?
First, show me your skills.{nl}From the Woods of the Linked Bridges, come back after defeating 10 Lapflammers and 10 Lapemans.
If you train hard, it won't be that hard.
Good.{nl}You look competent enough to progress to the next level.
Are you the one who wants to walk the way of Highlander?{nl}Then, you should pass the test.{nl}I don't have time to waste on someone who is not worthy enough.
The main weapon of the Highlander are the two handed swords. They are strong, but you should possess enough power to hold the swords.{nl}Attack the practice pole near it and I will test how strong you are.
Attack the practice pole near me.{nl}I will evaluate how strong you are.
Hmm... It seems that you won't have a big problem.{nl}If you pass one more test, I will teach the skills of Highlander.
Your power seems to be enough.{nl}Now, I will check how you use that power well.
With you skills, Lapflammers at Paupys Dock won't be hard.{nl}When you come back after defeating 10 of them, I will open the way of Highlander to you.
Come back after defeating Lapflammers at Paupys Dock.
Your competence won't do any harm to Highlanders' fame.{nl}My father who is a master would say the same thing.{nl}On behalf of the master, I will teach you the skills of Highlander.
You want to become a Peltasta? That's a wise decision.{nl}Let me ask one question to you. Do you hate the demons?
Good. The most basic requirements have been fulfilled.{nl}We, Peltastas use the shield aggressively to face against the enemies.{nl}So you must have the basic understanding of using the shield.
I'm going to ask you for some materials for your shield.{nl}First you collect metal decorations from Lapemans.{nl}Also, gather some dry wood from an isolated worshop there.
The Lapeman metal decorations are used for the frame, the wood for the body.{nl}You'll find both in Paupys Crossing.
Well done.{nl}When you obtain the manual for the shield in the future, I want you to make it yourself by collecting the materials yourself.
Welcome to the world of Peltastas.{nl}Let's do our best until we defeat all the demons!
It's always good to see new brothers and sisters.{nl}Can you help the villagers here with me?
It's not good since Lapemans are keep giving the villagers pain at Linked Bridges.{nl}In fact, I want to punish them myself.{nl}But, Rosaliya... told me that I should not leave Orsha.
On behalf of me, please correct the bad habit of Lapezards and Lapemiter.
I am just doing my important duty which I've received from Master.{nl}I am not jealous of your journey!
Have you completed the mission?{nl}You would be able to become a higher level Cleric.
I welcome any brothers or sisters who would walk the way of Krivi.{nl}My name is Mellinda.{nl}I am going to give you a simple test if you are qualified to become a Krivi. Are you okay?
Good. The test is simple.{nl}Receive this crystal jewel.
This absorbs the monster's vitalities and possess them as the energy of the flame.{nl}Hunt for the monsters outside the city and put the energies into the jewel.
When the jewel gets big, use the jewel to light up the torch beside me.{nl}With that, I will test to see if you would be able to use the energies of the torch well.
Defeat the monsters and fill in the energies of the jewel.{nl}And when you light up the torch with the jewel, the test will be over.
I think you would be able to use the energy of the torch efficiently.{nl}Welcome to the way of Krivi.
You want to walk the way of the Priest.{nl}I recognized it at once. Your competence is enough to become a Priest.{nl}It's just... to pray that your journey would be alright, we need some preparations.
Please receive this divine water.{nl}And you just have to receive blessing from the other priests here in Orsha.{nl}Ask for the blessing to Clerik, Krivi and Bokor sub-masters.
Ask for the blessing to Cleric, Krivi and Bokor sub-masters.
Good. Blessing from the four priests including me would help your journey.{nl}From now on, I want you to concentrate on the roles of Priest and responsibilities.
You want to step into a higher level?{nl}It's going to be a tough way. Are you still going to go? To look for the strength?
Good. If that's so I would have to check whether you are ready.{nl}Defeat Yognomes at 63_3 of Bracken Forest.
If you could defeat 30 of them, I would acknowledge your strength.
You are not just bluffing, but you surely possess competence.{nl}On behalf of the master, I will teach you everything about the Swordsman.
Did you get used to two handed swords?{nl}Now, I will teach you how you can use two handed swords well.
But, I want to check how much you've grown up as a Highlander.{nl}Yognomes at 63_3 of Bracken Forest would fit you well. I will teach you the skills after that.
Defeat 30 Yognomes at 63_3 of Bracken Forest.
Well done. As I promised to you, I will teach you high level skills that can be used with two handed swords.
Have you become familiar with using shields in battles?{nl}Okay then I will teach you the skills of Peltasta now.
And of course we should first find out whether you would be able to handle the high level skills.{nl}Defeat the monsters at 63_3 of Bracken Forest and collect the crystals from the monsters.{nl}You can get two from the demons so please go after the demons aggressively.
But, there are restrictions.{nl}Firstly, I only admit the crystals which you've obtained while equipped with shiedls.{nl}Secondly, if you become unable to fight, the crystals you would have collected until that point will be all cancelled.
Defeat the monsters and collect the crystals while equipped with a shield.{nl}This is to check your surviving skills.{nl}For your reference, it will be efficient to defeat the demons.
You seem competent enough as a Peltasta.{nl}Congratulations. As I promised to you, I will teach you skills that are one level higher.
It's easy to teach you how to use a spear, but your mind is important.{nl}There is a location to test applicants like you.{nl}The assignment is simple. It's just irritating.
Come back after defeating 30 Yognomes from Bracken Forest 63_3.{nl}If you do so, I will acknowledge your skills.{nl}In my feelings, you would pass the test easily.
If you have a trouble with Yognomes, then it wouldn't be that bad to look for another way.
You want to become a Barbarian? Can you endure the training?{nl}Good. I will test you to see whether you can at least imitate some fightings.{nl}If this was our hometown, they would have passed the test. Do you want to receive it?
The most important quality of Swordsman is belligerence.{nl}You should attack anyone who shows hostility to the ones that you should protect.{nl}Think of Yognomes at 63_3 of Bracken Forest as your barriers and destroy all of them.
I thought you are wiry since you told me that you wanted to become a Barbarian... Are you going to give up?
There are some useful people here even in this place.{nl}Good. On behalf of Walter at Klaipeda, I will teach you the skills of Barbarian.
Have you heard the stories?{nl}Some of the refugees that were coming to Orsha are hurt and fell near Lemprasa Pond.{nl}We should save them!
I've endowed the blessing onto this special ointment.{nl}Use this ointment to cure the refugees who are laid near Lemprasa Pond.{nl}After curing all refugees, I will acknowledge you as a true cleric.
If it was not the order of the master, I would have gone there.{nl}I have no one to trust except for you.
It is so fortunate that a big problem didn't occur to them.{nl}It's all because of the devotion that you've shown to us.{nl}You look competent enough to progress to the last stage of Cleric.
I think the time has come to tell your religious belief to the goddesses and receive the blessings.{nl}Pray to the goddesses near Orsha and dedicate these goods.
Go to the statues of the goddesses at Lemprasa Pond, Linked Bridges, and Paupys Dock.{nl}Return after dedicating the goods to all statues.
There are no official steps when it comes to offerings.{nl}They're something you do when you want to repent of past mistakes.
Well done. Aren't there any broken parts of the statues of the goddesses?{nl}You now have reached a higher stage.
I am taking care of the refugees of Orsha with other priests.{nl}But, the herbs that should be used for the ointment has run out.{nl}The time has come to test for your advancement so I will give you a small assignment.
I am looking for three kinds of herbs.{nl}Obtain the herbs from 63_1, 63_2 and 63_3 of Bracken Forest.
You will see the first herb when you dig into the pile of tree leaves near the exit which leads to the next territory.{nl}The second herb is growing on the region located below.{nl}The third herb has the yellow flower so you will easily find it.
The effects of the three herbs are not that different from each other.{nl}As I told you, don't forget this also tests for your advancement.
Let's see... It surely is.{nl}When your good deeds accumulate like this, you will feel that your religious belief gets deeper.{nl}You've passed the test. From now on, you will be learning higher level Priest skills.
Are you the one who wants to become a Bokor?{nl}Welcome. In order to become a Bokor, there is a test you must pass.{nl}Have you heard about it?{nl}
Yes! You should have made Bokor dolls in order for you to be called a Bokor.{nl}Make the doll with this manual.
Long time ago, the Master also became a Bokor after making Shaman Dolls.{nl}It is the ritual which has the history and the tradition.
This Shaman Doll has the highest grade among the dolls which I've seen before!{nl}You seem to possess the attributes of Bokor.{nl}Now, you are the Bokor. Welcome!
You want to become a Dievdirbys? Of course, I welcome you.{nl}The way of Dievdirbys is open to everyone.{nl}Just... If you could listen to one of my little requests.
The end of the graving chisel has run out.{nl}I guess we should ask the blacksmith in Orsha.{nl}Tell him that it is my request and get the new graving chisel.
I am sorry. I am counting on you until Orsha.{nl}I have matters to do here.
What's the matter? Ah.. I remember that Dievdirbys girl.{nl}But, what should I do. The chisel and the materials are all ran oout.
I hope you can get the materials.
There will be times when you discover the chunks that are accumulated with metals from Yognomes at 63_3 of Bracken Forest.{nl}If you could bring those, I will make an useful graving chisel for you.
The metals that are accumulated in the bodies of the monsters get crumpled together at 63_3 of Bracken Forest.{nl}Defeat Yognomes and collect the metal chunks.
Yes. This would be enough.{nl}Crafting is not that hard so if you wait a bit, I will make it for you.
It is almost done.
It is a decent object so you would be able to stand for some time.{nl}Give it to him.
Ask him to come by Orsha sometimes.
Damn... I knew that it was taking longer than expected, but I didn't know that you made such efforts.{nl}Thank you. Of course, you are a Dievdirbys from now on.
You've improved a lot! Everyone would acknowledge your skills.{nl}It's just.. you fall little short according to my father's standards.{nl}I will help you to reach a higher stage.
Good. Let's see one more time if you are competent enough to learn higher level skills.{nl}I will see how you handle existing skills well.{nl}I don't care which monster, just defeat any monster using Highlander's skills.
Defeating monsters with the skills of Highlander. I think it's easy for the last assignment.
I've seen you use the skills which you previously learned really well.{nl}You won't have a problem learning higher level skills without any problem.{nl}I think I can say to anyone proudly that I am the one who taught you the skills.
You would easily defeat any kinds of demons.{nl}But, in order to defeat the real bad demons, you will have to try hard.{nl}I will open the true way of Peltasta for you.
But, you should at least pass the minimum requirement.{nl}Come back after defeating Chapparitions from Karolis Springs.
Chapparitions are not hard if we think about the courage that you've shown us so far.{nl}Don't worry too much.
Very good! I can now acknowledge you as a fellow soldier.{nl}I should report to the master individually.{nl}I will show you the true power of Peltastas with my authority.
Your growth is really surprising. I can feel something different in you.{nl}I am sure you will become stronger. Are you ready to proceed to the next level?
There is a monster which I faced long time ago.{nl}It ran away and I was worried that it may hurt the other people.
There is a rumor that he appeared again.{nl}Please kill it on behalf of me.{nl}And as a proof, please bring me the chisel that is on the body of the monster.
Defeat Sparnasman at 64_2 of Bracken Monastery and bring me the tip of my spear.
That is definitely the tip of my spear wihich was on the body of the monster.{nl}I can proudly say that our competent Hopelite defeated it.
Hmm... You've become very strong.{nl}I didn't know that you've completed the training that hard. You will be able to learn the skills of the next stage.
Of course, I can't just teach you for free. Prove the strength you have!{nl}Without any enhancement effects on your body, come back after defeating the monsters at Feretory Hills.
Prove the strength of the sword.
You are way more useful than I expected.{nl}My brother would be glad to know that a competant lad like you became a Barbarian.
You know well about the structure of the shield.{nl}You can come to me anyime to learn.
Cataphract. {nl}I don't know if it would fit you well.
I like your spirit.{nl}Try defeating Beast-type monsters at Feretory Hills.
Since Medzio Diena, the monsters that inflict the most harm are the Beast-type.{nl}Defeat the Beast-type monsters at Feretory Hills.
I think you would be able to reach a higher level Krivis.{nl}Do you want to receive the test?
With this jewel, please go to Feretory Hills.{nl}Make scars on the monsters and use the power of the jewel to purify the monsters.{nl}When you do that, ashes will remain. Please gather them.
Don't worry. It is the sacred flame so it would not harm you.
Your competence has been proven as a result.{nl}Congratulations on your entrance to the last stage of Krivis.{nl}I want you to help the ones who are stuggling with the power you have.
Now, it is time to leave for a far place and spread the blessing of the goddesses.{nl}But, we never know what kind of dangers are ahead of us.{nl}Especially the times like nowadays.
Please show us that at least you can protect yourself.
The monsters at Feretory Hills would be enough.{nl}Come back after defeating them.
We can't save other people by just relying on the divinity.{nl}There are times that we need to use some force.
You won't have any trouble travelling far away.{nl}As a priest, please keep your mind and do your duties with all your heart.
Now is the time to proceed to the next level of Bokor.{nl}I want to forecast your future as one of your collegues.{nl}Face the violent monsters and please bring me the cards that they drop.
The master told me that it is already decided that who and what cards will be brought.{nl}However, with my skills, I don't know what cards you would bring.
The light, the salavation, the vice and the cursed jewel..? These are the everything I can read.{nl}They are all rarely written. Especially the last word is significant.
It's your duty to interpret them.{nl}But, you look like someone with the abnormal destiny unlike other people.{nl}I hope that you can fulfill all your duties.
When I was parted with Tesla, he gave me an assignment.{nl}I have to carve some special sculpture, but the materials are hard to obtain.{nl}He told me to request to someone who can be relied on and I think you are the right person.
You will be able to encounter a monster called Sparnasman at 64_2 of Bracken Forest.{nl}Please bring me the horn on your head.
He didn't ask me to save him myself, but he wants me to ask someone who can be relied on...{nl}I think he is also testing my benevolence.
You brought them well. I can tell they are the materials that I asked you.{nl}As I promised, I will teach you high level skills of Dievdirbys.
You want to enter the way of Sadhu?{nl}Okay. Although it's hard for me to take the official test since only my spirit is here...{nl}I will test you with my method.
I will pass you my energies to you.{nl}When you use that energy at Feretory Hills, a part of monsters' spirits will be mixed.{nl}Defeat that monster and come back after absorbing the spirit.
It seems that the spirits of the monsters are not enough yet.{nl}I can't open the way of Sadhu yet.
I can feel the great power of the spirit in you...{nl}I can tell how great is your competence. Congratulations on your entrance to the way of Sadhu.{nl}I will teach you the skills of Sadhu although only my spirit is here.
You want to enter the way of Paladin?{nl}It is different from other priestsl. In order to become a Paladin, you have to possess strong power.
Good. You're skilled.{nl}Okay then, shall I test you? Come back after defeating monsters at Feretory Hills.
We, Paladins stand at the front line when we fight against the demons.{nl}With the uncertain skills you have, you would soon experience something unfortunate.
You've done well way better than I expected.{nl}As I promised, I will appoint you as a Paladin on behalf of the Master.
Now is the time to take the last test.{nl}Are you ready to show me the skills that you've accumulated?
The Apsimesti Crossroads used to be the last test place for Hoplites.{nl}Many of your seniors fought against the monsters until their spears worn out.{nl}I will test your qualifications by seeing you gathering those broken spears.
This test isn't just to measure your strength.{nl}The stage which you are trying to reach can't be reached that easily.{nl}You also have to check how others tried to reach that level.
Well done. In the future, a new hoplite will follow the traces of you.{nl}You are already at the master stage, but if there's anything lacking, please come visit me.
I can now call you a Rodelero.{nl}However, in order to become stronger, sometimes you should know your strength as well.
I think you are ready.{nl}If that's so, defeat the monsters at Apsimesti Crossroads without using a shield.{nl}In fact, face the monsters without equipping the monsters.
The shields are the most reliable colleague of Rodelero.{nl}But, a Swordsman should be strong himself.
I was able to check the potential again.{nl}As you know, my teaching is very strict so you should be well prepared.
How about it, do you understand now what the piercing is?{nl}Okay, then let's get ready to proceed to the next level.
Let's assume that the spear which can pierce any enemy is your arm.{nl}We can say the legs are your companion which give you the mobility.{nl}Defeat the enemies in Apsimesti Crossroads while mounted on a companion.
If you don't get used to fighting agaist the others while mounted on a companion, give up on Cataphract.{nl}You don't have travel sickness right?
You are going to become a good cavalry after the kingdom gets reconstructed in the future.{nl}Of course, until then, use the skills that I will teach you and do your duties at your best.
You've passed all previous assignements and your growth rate is also amazing.{nl}You won't have any problem enetering the last stage of Bokor!
No no. You shouldn't be satisfied too soon.{nl}Now, it is your turn to utilize the skills you've learned so far.{nl}Defeat the monsters at Apsimesti Crossroads.
The skills which you've learned will be used effectively in the battles.{nl}It wouldn't be that dangerous in Apsimesti Crossroads.
Well done!{nl}Now your journey as a Bokor has really started.
I barely got in contact with Tesla!{nl}I've wrote you in the letter and he surely has high expectations in you.{nl}So, how about you try out for the last level of Dievdirbys?
By completing the request that was sent to us, I will treat that as your advancement test.{nl}The request is to repair the statue of the goddesses, but we need the materials for the perfumed oil that will be used for the repair.{nl}Please gather the lumps of oil from Ashrongs at Aqueduct region.
When you gather the lumps of oil from Ashrongs, I will refine it and make it into the perfumed oil.
We've completed the preparation stage.{nl}If you wait a bit, I will make you perfumed oil.
The perfumed oil has been completed.{nl}With this perfumed oil, please repair Vakarine Statue at Orsha and Fedimian.
I heard that one can easily move to Fedimian by using the power of the Goddess Statue.{nl}We would be able to reduce some time.
I think the citizens at the two cities will have hope by just looking at the clean statues.
You've come back from a long way. Tesla would compliment for sure.{nl}You would become great from now on.{nl}I guess I have a rival now.
You've come at the right time.{nl}I've heard that the number of Red Triamublos has increased a lot at Apsimesti Crossroads and they are threatening the villagers.{nl}If you want to step forward as a true Sadhu, please share your abilities.
For the next test, face against stronger monsters.{nl}Are you ready?
Please take these relics to The Starving Demon's Way.{nl}When you react the relics to the abandoned altar up there, the monsters would appear.{nl}You know what's next even if I don't tell you anything right?
The abandoned altar is at the dead end of Starving Demon's Way up there.
Well done. You've stepped into a higher level.{nl}You possess the skills which I want to show to my ungle who is a master.
You've improved again. My uncle will be surprised.{nl}You should take the test to go to the last stage.{nl}We need the way to prove your skill.
I know a suitable opponent who you can fight against.{nl}Monsters called Gaigalas are going crazy at Tenants' Farm.
I can see how great you are.{nl}But, in order to advance, we need more clear verification.
In fact, I thought it's going to be dangerous, but I guess I misunderstood your skills.{nl}Well done. Anyone would acknowledge you as a high level Paladin.
I am looking for the whereabouts of Goddess Zemyna.{nl}Everyone knows that the goddess has disappeared.{nl}
Those relics belong to the goddesses.{nl}You shouldn't insult the dead by joking in the name of the goddess.{nl}
What?{nl}What have you brought here?{nl}Ah... it doesn't matter. If you are okay, can you help me out?{nl}
You've brought them well. Thanks.{nl}I want to repay you at the village..{nl}We, villagers do not really welcome outsiders though..{nl}
On your way back, you've seen the demons with the gigantic axe and the girl who was being chased after the demon?{nl}The demon with the great axe is the Demon Lord Zaura...{nl}The Revelator and the girl shoudn't meet... It's not something normal...{nl}
I should tell this to the village and let villagers know.{nl}We can't let outsiders fall into danger due to the matters in our village.
What? Are you the Revelator?{nl}If that's so, have you come here after dreaming about the disaster?{nl}.. If that's so, you may be the Revelator in the folkore that is passing down in our village.{nl}
In our village, the forecast which was left by the goddess Laima is being passed down as a folklore.{nl}When the village was in danger, the Revelator who came to chase after the dream with the sacred light{nl}It was about defeating the evil energy and saving the village.{nl}It's not time for this. We should get to the village and find out more about it.{nl}
I will go to the village and find out more about the folklore.{nl}I want you to retrieve the food which the ferrets had took away.{nl}Although, we don't welcome outsiders, if you could retrieve the food that was stolen by the ferrets, the villagers would help you out.
Is that you? Are you the Revelator who Leja was talking about?{nl}I heard that the village priests that were attacked by ferrets were saved by you with the ray.{nl}You've finally come. Good. The Revelator who's going to save the village has come.{nl}Ohoh... Goddess Laima... Thank you. You didn't abandon us...{nl}
What is that? Isn't that the food that was stolen by ferrets?!{nl}Hey guys! Look at this! The Revelator retrieved the stolen food!{nl}You've really come here to save our village.{nl}Thanks. Thank you very much.
Leja has left to Zehara to look for something that would help her.{nl}There is a statue which was carved by the ancestors who used to serve for Goddess Laima.{nl}She said Laima must have prepared something on the statue of the goddess.{nl}If you are planning to go to Zeraha, listen to my story before you go.{nl}
A long time ago, when Goddess Laima disappeared after forecasting the ominous future,{nl}She was worried about us and asked Goddess Lada to take care of the village.{nl}However, unlike Laima's forecast, the village was peaceful.{nl}
Medzio Diena came in the middle of peaceful days.{nl}The demons kidnapped Lada and the river had turned red.{nl}The ones who drank the water from the river suffered and the fruits that consumed the water from the river got big.{nl}The big fruits were not edible like the red water.{nl}
After the disaster swept the village, villagers believe the folklore that the Revelator who came to the village after dreaming about the disaster{nl}will defeat the evil energy and save the village with the light.{nl}
The most urgent issue is that the ferrets that were gentle before turned violent.{nl}We want to save Lada, but since violent ferrets are attacking the village{nl}and stealing the food, everyone is suffering.{nl}I think the Demon Totem which was built by the demons near the ferrets' hideout here turned the ferrets violent...{nl}
Since the ferrets are protecting the Demon Totem, it's hard for us to break the Demon Totem.{nl}For the village, can you break the Demon Totem?{nl}If that's so, we would be able to help you to save Lada.{nl}I am sure that you would be able to restore the ferrets.
You are truly the Revelator in the folklore.{nl}Since you've broke the Demon Totem, the ferrets will turn gentle again.{nl}Thanks. I will check the ferrets by sending my grandchildren.{nl}While you were away, a mysterious girl came to the village.
The mysterious girl disappeared into Zeraha after going through here without any words.{nl}Our ancestors told us that whenever Laima comes to our village, a warm atmosphere surrounds the village.{nl}It was short, but when that girl came to the village, I felt the warm energy which our ancestors told us.{nl}
I am sure Laima has left her to guide you.{nl}Chase after the girl.
Revelator, have you drank the red water before?{nl}If you had drank it before, I am sure you won't be able to talk to me now.{nl}Even if you are really thirsty, you shouldn't drink the red water. If you drink it, you will suffer from it.{nl}It is so toxic. The fruits that grew by consuming the water got huge and weren't edible.{nl}
I was once lost in a forest and I was really thirsty then.{nl}I found a container with fruit juice in it which the ferrets had accumulated.{nl}Dying from thirst or dying from the ferrets, dying is the same.{nl}So I drank the juice without the ferrets knowing and nothing happened to me.{nl}
I don't know what was done to it, but I think it can be used for drinkable water.{nl}Now, the water started to surface so we should have the water.{nl}Can you gather the fruit juice from the ferrets? I am counting on you.
We are in trouble. While you were out to obtain the fruit juice, ferrets attacked the village and stole the food.{nl}It won't work this way. Even if we retrieve the food, the ferrets will attack the village again.{nl}I will fix the bad habit of the ferrets this time.{nl}
Look for the food which the ferrets have stolen and spice it with the red water.{nl}The ferrets that consumed it will suffer from pain and will not ever come back to steal food again.{nl}
The polluted red water can be obtained from the well down there.{nl}Please pollute the food that was stolen by the ferrets with the red water.{nl}Especially, you should pollute the beef jerkies. Ferrets really love beef jerkies.
I know it doesn't feel good to pollute the food, but...{nl}That is the best way in the long term.
We can call this kind of situation one step back and two steps forward.{nl}I hope the ferrets enjoy the beef jerkies and never come back again.
Ah, Revelator. Thank you for destroying the Demon Totem.{nl}I've went to see the ferrets, but they are still violent.{nl}I think the influence of the totem is still remaining.{nl}
I heard Widas who is a Dievdirbys is trying to make{nl}the piece which has the opposite effect when compared to the Demon Totem.{nl}Please ask Widas if the piece has been completed.
This sculpture that possesses the opposite effects to Demon Totems...{nl}Wait a minute...
I heard that the demons are turning the ferrets violent using the totem{nl}so I tried creating a sculpture which possesses the opposite effects of the Demon Totem...{nl}We are still experimenting on it, but I think now is the best chance to test it although it is still in an experimental stage since the totem has disappeared.{nl}
I will give you the sculpture which I was creating..{nl}Place it near the ferrets and observe the behavior of the ferrets...
The ferrets have become more violent...?{nl}Damn... Did I fail...{nl}I am sorry... You are not hurt?{nl}
Ah... We are not going to give up on the pieces... It is maybe because the demons' brainwashing has not been removed yet...{nl}When Druid Benes who is investigating on the ferrets on Zeraha comes back, I think I should seek help from Benes...
Ah, Revelator!{nl}What? That mysterious girl may be the guide prepared by Laima?{nl}The girl ran away there after being chased by ferrets!{nl}I was going to chase them, but since Ferrets are going crazy, I can't chase them...
It's not the time for this... Revelator.{nl}Since the ferrets are chasing after the girl, maybe the ferrets are looking for the traces of the girl.{nl}I guess I should look for the girl while defeating ferrets. We should hurry.
I hope the girl is safe... I should've gone after her...
...The girl was kidnapped by the demon holding a gigantic axe? That's not good...{nl}If the demon was holding a gigantic axe, I am sure it is the Demon Lord, Zaura.{nl}Demon Lord Zaura commands the demons that attacked this place and kidnapped Lada.
When Zaura kidnapped the girl, were ferrets with the girl?{nl}If that's so, I think Zaura left the kidnapped girl to the ferrets.{nl}Since the ferrets know more about the forest.{nl}
I think I know where the ferrets had hidden the girl. However, it is dangerous to go without any preparations.{nl}I know how to make the incense that makes the ferrets lose their conciousness. If you use this incense, you will be able to defeat the ferrets easily.{nl}But, the problem is that we don't have enough Drowsy Herbs.{nl}
Drowsy herbs are growing from down there.{nl}I will prepare to make the incense so can you get me Drowsy Herbs?
You don't have to worry about inhaling the incense.{nl}I've made it to be effective only on ferrets.
The incense has been completed.{nl}I will tell you a few locations where the ferrets may have taken the girl.{nl}Don't worry even if the ferrets are protecting the girl.{nl}When you burn this incense on a bonfire, the ferrets will lose their conciousness so rescue the girl while they are unconscious.
The goddess... under... that... sapling...
Savior... I am Laima, the goddess of the destiny.{nl}You followed the girl who is the incarnate of my will.{nl}In this forest, my sister, Lada was captured by Zaura.{nl}Zaura is creating something evil called the 'Kruvina' with the vitalities of Lada.{nl}
Save Lada who is captured in Seir Rainforest and stop the demons' plans to make Kruvina.{nl}The only one who can get rid of the disaster is you.{nl}Please take this orb. It would help you a lot.
Ah... I didn't expect I would see a human here...! Please help me!{nl}I am called Druid Benes. I am trying to find the reason why the ferrets are coopering with the demons.{nl}Recently, I found out that I will be able to talk to the ferrets using the spell of the Druids.{nl}
But, the problem is that I touched the ferrets too many times while looking for other methods.{nl}Even if I turn into a ferret, they attack me as if they remember my odor.{nl}Can you turn into a ferret on behalf of me and find out about their plans?{nl}
You would be able to talk with the ferrets naturally. {nl}Talk with the ferrets and find out why they are cooperating with the demons.
Did the ferrets really tell you so? Of course, I think there's no reason they should lie...{nl}But, I can't believe it... The ferrets were once very kind.{nl}We were good with the ferrets until the demons came here. They spontaneously attacked us...{nl}
I should find out how much hostility the ferrets have towards humans.{nl}I will try to turn a piece of wood into the appearance of a wounded villager.{nl}When you set this wood, it would look like a wounded villager to anyone.{nl}Set this near the ferrets and find out if the ferrets attack.
If the ferrets even attack the wounded villager, that will be really dangerous...
Did the ferrets attack the woods with the spell?{nl}That's not good. That means the ferrets attack humans indiscriminately...
It became apparent as a result of the experiment. The ferrets are dangerous now.{nl}However, since we can't fight against all the ferrets, We should kick them out from the village.{nl}
I possess some terrible odor which the ferrets don't like.{nl}Light up a bonfire and when you burn the terrible odor, the ferrets will run away after smelling the odor.{nl}Please spread the odor near Bellai Forest Village where the villagers are gathered around.{nl}The odor is little... disgusting to humans so please keep that in mind...
I guess we should make more incense.{nl}Since we don't know when the effects of the incense would run out.
Was the smell terrible?{nl}Thanks. Now, the ferrets wouldn't be able to come near the village.{nl}I feel bad because I had used the terrible odor on the ferrets due to the bad tricks of the demons.{nl}When I go back to the village, I should look for a way to restore the ferrets to their original state with Dievdirbys Widas.
Thank you for saving me...{nl}Although weak, I can feel the power of Laima in you...{nl}You are the savior who Laima talked about before...{nl}
Laima forecasted that a disaster would come to this forest which won't be prevented by me.{nl}And she also said the savior who brings the orb which she has left would be able to solve the disaster in this forest.{nl}Everything goes as Laima forecasted.
Zaura wants to create strong Kruvina using my vitalities.{nl}Kruvina is a demons' object which uses humans' vitalities and it amplifies the power of the holder.{nl}But, if one can't stand the power of the Kruvina, it destroys the body of the holder.{nl}The demons are trying to use the Kruvina on plants and kill all humans with the plants.{nl}
The reason why the water in the forest turned red and the trees and the fruits grew gigantic is all due to the Kruvina.{nl}The demons that were satisfied with the results wanted to create a stronger Kruvina,{nl}and eventually kidnapped me and use my vitalities to create the Kruvina.{nl}
Savor... The Kruvina should not exist in this world.{nl}Only you can destroy the Kruvina and stop the conspiracy of the demons...{nl}Now is your chance since Zaura received critical damage and ran away!
Kruvina hasn't been completed, but since it is being created with the vitalities of the goddess{nl}it wouldn't be possible to break it with human force.{nl}
But, you are the Revelator...{nl}The power of Laima you possess coupled with my power would be able to destroy the Kruvina.{nl}But, all binding devices and the Kruvina creating devices are suppresing my power that is remaining in me.{nl}Please destroy the binding devices and the Kruvina creating devices. When my power comes back, I will share it to you.
Well done. Kruvina's growth will stop in incompleted status.
Although it is incomplete, I can't just leave the Kruvina since it is dangerous.{nl}Before the demons misuse the Kruvina, we should destroy it.{nl}
Now that my power is back which was suppressed by the Kruvina creation device, I will share my power with you.{nl}Put my power into the orb of Laima and destroy the Kruvina in the name of the savior.
A black demon called the Beholder took the unfinished Kruvina and disappeared...{nl}It's okay... Savior... It's not your fault..{nl}If you hadn't stopped the demons, they would have finished the Kruvina using the power of the goddesses.{nl}
You've done a big job.{nl}I am sure Laima who is my sister foresaw the Beholder.
Thank you for saving me. Savior.{nl}As a result, we were able to block the plans of the demons.{nl}Now, I am going to cooperate with the villagers to stabilize the forest.{nl}
Before Laima started drifting, she requested me something.{nl}When the savior appears and resolves all the disasters in the village,{nl}she wants me to take the savior to the hands of the Laima statue.{nl}Take the orb of the goddess which Laima has prepared and go to the hands of Laima at Zeraha.
I didn't expect Laima was captured by Giltine...{nl}Savior... I am counting on you.{nl}You are the only one who can stop the consipiracy of Giltine and save Laima.{nl}
I will pass you the power in the orb to you.{nl}I hope it helps you when you do your duty..{nl}I will stabilize this place and restore my power to look for other sisters...
The shrine for the goddesses was built here originally, but the demons broke the shrines.{nl}I am trying to restore the shrine with the villagers for Lada and Laima who will come back one day.{nl}But, many demons are still roaming around.{nl}We should kick the demons out in order to restore the shrine.{nl}
I don't know why demons are still remaining here after seeing the Demon Lord expelled.
There is a huge city called Fedimian which is not that far away from this forest.{nl}Among the masters in Fedimian, there may be someone who knows how to purify the land.{nl}I have to look for him, but I can't leave now since I am too busy..{nl}Can you go get an advice from the master who knows how to purify the land on behalf of me?
Gina Greene
Ahah... I know how to purify land.{nl}I can't leave now, so I will write down the magic circle of the purification on the scroll.
Among the masters in Fedimian, there must be someone who knows how to purify the land!{nl}There must be someone...
You've come back soon. Have you found the method?{nl}
The Druid Master wrote you the scroll himself?{nl}That means what's drawn on that scroll is the magic circle of the purification!{nl}This is more than I expected. Thank you!
Now, with the scroll of the purification that we've obtained, we now have to purify the land.{nl}It seems that the demon totems that are standing across the land are causing the pollution.{nl}But, due to the demons that are protecting demon totems, we can't go near..{nl}
Thank you so much for resolving matters that were difficult for the villagers!{nl}Your strong power helped us a lot.{nl}When the shrine for the goddesses gets built here in the future, please stop by!
Now, I am going to work with the villagers to restore the shrine for the goddesses.{nl}I am looking for where to build the shrine and I found up there the land with full of vitalities.{nl}The demons rushed in so I couldn't look at it carefully, but the energy from the ground{nl}would help us restoring the vitalities.{nl}
Even now, Kruvina is getting completed slowly.{nl}We should hurry.
If we break the device that absorbs the vitalities, my vitalities would not be passed to Kruvina.
Let's do it little more.{nl}Please hold on little longer. Savior.
Please purify the land which the demons polluted.
The binding device is suppressing all my remaining power and binding me.{nl}The binding device is not that strong so you would be able to destroy it with your power.
You've done well.{nl}The power that was locked inside the binding device has come back a bit.{nl}Now, we should break the absorbing device.
The device is absorbing my vitalities using the magic circle.{nl}It was created to absorb only the vitalities of innocent goddess so it will stop working when it absorbs other vitalities.{nl}Especially, when the blood of the demon which is opposite from my vitality gets mixed, ii would resist a lot.
You are truly the savior prepared by Laima.{nl}We now only have Kruvina controlling device left.{nl}
Kruvina controlling device accumulates the vitalities of the goddesses and sends some amount to Kruvina{nl}and suppresses Kruvina creation.{nl}It moves by the demonic energy of the demons so when you use the orb of the goddess{nl}the device would be overloaded and stop working.
The great cathedral is near Fedimian so religiously, it flourished a lot.{nl}Fedimian could not avoid Medzio Diena, but the survivors grouped together and{nl}are trying to restore Fedimian.
The girl is looking at the tree that is shining mysteriously.
As black powders dropped from the pillar, the monsters are rushing in!
As you brushed off black powders, you can see the engraved letters!
The light of the crystal that shines mysterious ray seems weaker than I thought.{nl}In order for it to illuminate enough ray, please obtain luminous oil from the monsters nearby!
You would be able to read the letters after collecting luminous oil!
Say the numbers that the letters indicate near the pillar!
You can't see it clearly, but the moss that shines vaguely enables you to read the letters a bit. {nl}When you collect the mosses like these, you would be able to read the letters.
The pillar has collapsed!{nl}Obtain sticky liquid from the monsters and repair the pillar!
Please obtain some sticky liquid that would be used to repair the pillar!
Finally, it seems I would be able to read the letters!
I will help
I am not interested in it
As Albinas told you, the polluted tombstones are attracting monsters!{nl}Defeat the monsters and break the tombstones!

There is a problem at 36_1 of the valley area.{nl}Just put the Namott of Purification which I gave to you on the place where demonic energy is strongest.
I... didn't expect to see someone here..{nl}
You better run away.{nl}Lots of demons are here.{nl}
A little while ago, a demon appeared at the place where there is the owl sculputre and controlling the monsters.
Why there? Are you insane?{nl}They are demons.{nl}
I don't know how strong you are, but...{nl}I am going to stay here. If you are gonna go, go alone.{nl}
I was being chased by the demons and ran upto here.{nl}I don't want to see any more troubles.
There were no demons and only other monsters?{nl}Oh, I'm glad...{nl}
Even so, you don't look like you are hurt... it seems that you are stronger than I expected.{nl}I see you differently now.
I've already gave up on one salvation and I couldn't do anything on Medzio Diena.{nl}However, even so, I can't give up everything.{nl}
I will tell you in due time so please collect some Green Infro Holder Eggs.
The eggs of Green Infro Holder are the key to binding the souls.{nl}Now, we need to substantiate it.
Don't think of it as unpleasant. {nl}This is the best I can do for now.
Hey!{nl}Please help me.
My friends are being attacked by the demons!
Please save my friends from the demons. I beg you.
If you were not there, we would have killed brutally by now.
At AA village.{nl}He is hiding, but the demons would find him quickly.
Thank you for helping us. I am Rose. We are merchants who go various places to sell the goods.
We've decided to sell the goods to XX village which is my hometown and visited XX village.
But, there were no one in the village. There were really no one to think about they've gone to pick up the brackens.{nl}Therefore, we looked around various places to look for the villagers and ran away here after being attacked by the demons.
While running away, we've got seperated from our colleagues. It is important to find whereabouts of the villagers, but I am more worried whether my colleagues weren't attacked by the demons.
Are you really helping us?{nl}I guess the goddess hasn't abandoned us yet. It's not common these days which a competent person like you help someone who needs help.
We better use the olfactory sense of Rash. But, while Rash was running away from the demons, it consumed lots of stamina
If we recover Rash's stamina, it will be easy to find our colleagues.
This is the potion to recover stamina.{nl}I will give it to Rash.
Due to the potion you gave to me, Rash recovered its stamina fast.
I am going to make Rash to smell the odor that is coming out from the goods of my colleagues. Rash will guide you to the place where our colleagues are.
If Rash starts to wander around, let it smell the odor from the good I've handed over to you.
I will pray so that my colleagues are safe.
How did you know I am here?
How did Rash come here..{nl}Who are you and how have you come here with Rash?
I was able to encounter with my colleagues because of you.{nl}Thank you so much.
Now, le'ts chase the whereabouts of XX villagers.
I was too busy running away from the demons so I could not think about my luggages well. There are many goods that can be sold at expensive prices in the luggage. If we go out of the village, the demons would definitely run at me and attack me.
Can you look for the luggage on behalf of me?
What happened to my luggage?
You've found my luggage.{nl}Thank you so much for finding my luggage.
You saved us from the demons. Even so, we can't guarantee that we are now safe from the demons.
There are also Beast-type monsters around AA village other than the demons so it looks more dangerous.
I can't stay here since it's too unstable. Can you defeat the demons and the beast monsters around AA village?
I guess I should think about doing other jobs.
The demons and the beast monsters are still wandering around, but I am relieved a bit since at least they are not close enough to come to the village.
I was attacked by the demons while picking up the herbs. Fortunately, I saved my life, but I got hut a lot.
Please pick up the herbs that can cure the wounds. I think I may be better off if I get it on.
I want to go pick up the herbs myself, but it hurts a lot whenever I move.
Have you obtained the herbs?
Please give to me.
The pain still remains even after rubbing the herb on the wound area.
It seems that I am addicted to the poison that is being used by the demons.
It hurts a lot on the wound areas and I have hard time breathing..{nl}When you tell my symptoms to
It is the deadly poison. We don't have enough time. I will give you the medicine so please give to the patient fast.
Due to the medicine, I have less pain and I can breathe well.{nl}Thank you.
Let's check what happened at the village to find out whereabouts of the villagers.{nl}I want you to check A, B and C districts.
I'll have a look in other places.
Have you found any clues to to find the whereabouts of the villagers?
I've checked the footsteps of the demons in the village. I am sure the demons have intruded into the village. There are no corpses and the house looks normal so the demons are not planning to steal.
Then, why and what for, demons took the villagers?
There. The marble of Polki. As I arrived the village, I saw the marble of Polki dropped on the ground.
The marble of Polki can be an important clue to look for the villagers.
Let's look for the marble of Polki.
I can't see the marble of Polki anymore.
I think Polki dropped the marble, but we can't just find it.{nl}Let's look around.
I am sure Polki dropped the marble around here.
XX Villager
W-who... are you!
A-are you... on the same side with the demons?
Oh goddess! Thank you.
If it wasn't you, we would all have died.
Demons told us that they are going to use the braken and use us as the source of the divine tree! We should just look for someone who is qualified.
Demons intruded into the village and took the people away.
Demons were taking the villagers and heading towards the monastery. Demons stopped while taking us for a long time and then wizards appeared.
The wizard has done some unidentified ritual to the villagers.{nl}When he did the ritual to the villagers, there weren't any unique responses, but I was able to see the response when we did the ritual to your brother, Edmundas.
The wizard ordered the demons to take Edmundas seperately.
The wizard threatened us. We've told the wizard that Edmundas has sister who is you.{nl}And I also described your appearances.
After hearing the information about you, the wizard told us that
Kruvina is already prepared and the giant brackens
would soon spurt out the spores of the death.
And he continued,
if someone with the qualifications are ready, all humans will die.
Your spirits will be used as sources for the divine trees.
After hearing the words from the wizard, I ran away to let the lord of Orsha know it.
Let's go to the monastery fast
Herbalist Ash
While I was picking up the herbs, the demons appeared and attacked me. Fortunately, I ran away, but I am scared whether the demon would attack me again.
Starting from a few months ago, the demon started to appear at Knidos Forest.
Because of you, the place seems to be stabilized a bit.
As I was moving around to pick up the herbs, it was my first time to see the demons picking up the grass. I am not sure whether or not the demons are plotting something. I guess I should check which grass they are picking up.
Have you checked what grass did the demons extract?
As I expected. {nl}The demons are actually extracting the herbs that are highly toxic.
If we process this herb further, it would become a deadly poison to humans. It is so certain that the demons are extracting these herbs. I guess I should do something so that the demons would not be able to pick up the herbs. I will sprinkle the body fluid of the monsters to kill the herbs.
I won't let the demons do what they want to do.
This would be enough.
Sprinkle the body fluid of the monsters onto the herbs
Sprinkle the body fluid of the monsters onto the place where there are herbs.
Since there are no more herbs, the demons would not be able to pick up the herbs anymore.
You don't look like a settler, where are you coming from?
{nl}Ahha! You are the one who came with the elder.{nl}To meet the elder, you better go to the camp fast.{nl}When a person comes out from Orsha, he would go meet the lord.{nl}
You don't look like a settler.. Are you a traveler?{nl}There was an order from the lord for the settlers at the west district of Orsha to wait at Lemprasa Pond.{nl}When they come this far, the lord told us that he would send the soldiers and the officiers, but{nl}I can't see any people like them.
{nl}I am waiting for my friends so please go to the 2nd district and meet Bropen.{nl}He will tell you where Romanis has gone to.
After Medzio Diena, there were no special signs until recently.{nl}Except for the people that came from far away or the people who have gone further to the south and came back after reaching the seas..
Thank you so much for helping me!{nl}I was almost buried here.
{nl}How could he tell us to wait for the settlers in this dangerous place..{nl}When the families arrive, I guess I should move to another place..
It seems that you've leveled up while fighting against Kepas.{nl}The ones who come from outside learn everything fast.{nl}I envy your pace of learning.
{nl}{nl}If you have leveled up, you can become stronger by selecting one of the status.{nl}Do you want to check it now?
That was a good selection.{nl}You can select a status as you level up.{nl}I hope you make a cautious decision.
Are you looking for Romanas Elder?{nl}The elder has left to the camp direction with Reila.{nl}If you are gonna go to the camp, can you please pss this ointment?{nl}I almost died so I think I need to take some rest.
I heard that the small village which is across the river turned into a ruin.{nl}If the lord didn't order us to move out, we would have been in danger as well.
This is the ointment which Bropen was going to bring.{nl}Have you brought it on behalf of Bropen? Thank you so much.{nl}Romanas elder has left to the camp district.{nl}I was waiting for Bropen.
{nl}If you've leveled up, please use the skill points.{nl}When you use the skill points, you may obtain the new skills or enhance the existing skills!
So you are coming? You've done well to help the villagers.{nl}I am gonna go to Orsha soon to meet the lord. Where are you going?{nl}There are no villages except for Orsha and Klaipeda which the adventurers are likely to visit at the southern part of the kingdom.{nl}If you are gonna go for a long journey, it would not be bad to stop by at Orsha and meet the lord.
{nl}I am sorry, but if you are not busy, I want you to help the settlers.
I heard someone is helping the settlers and it's you!{nl}On behalf of the elder, I really appreciate you.
{nl}Are you going to stop at Orsha?{nl}But, as you can see, I am little busy.{nl}If you can wait a bit, I will help you after helping these people.
The story that the villages across the rivers, the fields and the mountains were stepped on by the monsters spreaded quickly..{nl}I've persuaded people that the soldiers would come and help us from Orsha, but as the story that the village right beside was attacked by the monsters spreaded, I couldn't reduce people's agitation.
{nl}I thought the goddesses abandoned us. I was going to move the people to Klaipeda.{nl}At then, they ordered people to move on the land where the lord survived..{nl}The damages were too severe. He should've called us sooner..
It's so hard for me to do this whole day.{nl}It may rather be better to follow the monsters like the soldiers.{nl}I want to help you... but, please also think about my situation.{nl}If I let you in first, they will be angry.{nl}
I will cancel my words that I would follow the monsters like the soldiers a while ago.{nl}Even when we have more than 10 lives, it would not be enough.{nl}Because of you, I was able to block the monsters from going into Orsha.{nl}It was a substitution time, so I almost fell into danger.
The settlers who were registering all ran away.. we will be free for some time.{nl}You are welcomed to go into Orsha.{nl}The lord is very strong and cold.{nl}Please go in front of the lord castle at the central square of Orsha.
The settlers who have travelled for many days are trembling in anxiety.{nl}Most of them didn't get to see Orsha.{nl}They must have thought that the castle fortress which they heard from a rumor would protect them safely..{nl}You would know when you enter it, it has changed a lot since Medzio Diena..
I am Innessa Hemandale who is controlling Orsha.{nl}Thank you for helping our citizens.
We are recovering Orsha as you can see.{nl}With the soldiers we have at the moment, it is hard for us to protect Orsha.{nl}That's why we are moving all setters who have survived to Orsha even if that means we are going to have hard time for several years.{nl}
The world turned wild, but neither the military nor the king protected us.{nl}You are the one who are helping the settlers right?{nl}Although, I am not competent enough, I am sure the goddesses want me to help you as well.
{nl}I want to make a medicine that would work well on your wounds.{nl}If you could collect Red Leaves from the 1st district, I will make the medicine using those!
I am not the settler who Romanas Elder has brought.{nl}I am a person from the village that turned into a ruin recently.{nl}The hunters told us that they've discovered the monsters, but the lord didn't send us the squad.{nl}When my family and I ran away from the village, a messenger of the lord came and told us to move to Orsha.
{nl}{nl}It would've been better if he had told us little sooner..{nl}We don't have any house, field or trees.{nl}What should we do to live on now..
With this much amount, we would be able to make the medicine.
{nl}Take it.{nl}Thank you for helping the settlers.
The settlers who've survived are coming here.{nl}They are all exhausted since they ran away for several days.{nl}I am making an invigorating drink for them.
{nl}You would probably need it.{nl}If you could defeat the monsters at the 2nd district and get me Lempar mucus,{nl}I will make you an invigorating drink with that.
I guess the lord had some different idea, but I don't know why he didn't order to move out sooner..{nl}Maybe the messenger was not diligent enough.{nl}I have lots of things to ask if I meet the lord.
I think we have enough Lempar muscus.
{nl}Okay. Please take this.{nl}May the goddesses protect you in your journey..
You haven't seen the people wander around this forest?{nl}Even after what the lord told us{nl}when the monsters intruded into our village, we all scattered to survive.
{nl}It is now time for everyone to come by now, but I think they lost their way in the forest.{nl}I am sorry, but can you light up the bonfire at the 3rd district to help the ones who lost their ways in the forest?{nl}
I've met some people here. {nl}No one saw the elder.
Thank you so much!{nl}The people who you've guided through the bonfire are resting at the safe area.{nl}Thank you so much.
I am counting the number of people and it seems that not even half of them has arrived here.{nl}Lots of people are still wandering the forest.{nl}I think I should make a smoke with a bigger bonfire.
{nl}For the settlers at the 4th district, I want you to light up the fire on the woods which Lutas prepared.{nl}With that, you would be able to see through the leaves.{nl}I am counting on you!
According to what Lutas told us, we can't just let in lots of settlers into Orsha{nl}so we've set up various small camps around the outer wall of Orsha and supporting the settlers.{nl}The bonfires which you've lit up are to support the settlers.
There was a big disturbance. You are not hurt anywhere?{nl}I am sorry that I've put you in this mess.
{nl}This is so horrible. Those gigantic monsters are wandering in the forest.{nl}We have nothing that we can do to the settlers in the forest..
I haven't seen you before. Are you the officer in Orsha?
{nl}Ah.. damn. I've made a big mistake.{nl}I am called Ibanayu from the southern coast.{nl}I heard that there are lots of supplies and we will be protected safely here so I've ran here without sleeping while leaving the village in the south..
{nl}As you can see, what's prepared for us is the bonfire and a few lumps of grass.{nl}Also we don't have enough officers who would protect us..
{nl}{nl}What we can do is that we can pick up the goods which the natives had used and left and use them to obtain the food.{nl}Can you collect those from the 5th district?{nl}I heard that if we leave this place, the monsters would go crazy so people like us can't walk around.
The south coast also received some damages.{nl}The fruits that came down from the river at the north destroyed all the fishing nets{nl}and due to the fruit juice that spurted out from the fruits, I've just kept seeing the sea which turned colorful.{nl}At least, the south was okay since there were no monsters there..
I will use them well. Since people are still coming up from the two villages at the southern coast,{nl}I will pass the story about you well if I meet the lord.
You look very different to be called as a settler...{nl}The people around Orsha do not wear clothes like that.{nl}Are you a traveler?
{nl}If that's so, why don't you pray in front of the Statue of Goddess Zemyna at the 6th district?{nl}Goddess Zemyna controls the land and she also takes care of the travel roads of the travelers.{nl}But, the goddess is not responding to our prayer from sometime.
I don't know who has set up so many statues of the goddess.{nl}But, as I hear it, it's very old.{nl}So they either break up or become monsters' habitats...{nl}and there are also cases of monsters going into the Goddess Statue.
{nl}Of course, you don't have to believe it...
Have you been to 7th district? The elder asked us to meet at the 7th district when we arrive at Lemprasa Pond, but we can't go due to the monsters...{nl}In order to prevent it from getting stolen from the settlers, we should go there first.{nl}But, I can't do that with my skills.
{nl}If monsters appear around there, can you please defeat them?{nl}When the elder come, I will tell him about you for sure.
Due to the order to move out, I abandoned my house and blamed a lot{nl}After I heard about the situation at the north, I stopped thinking about that.{nl}I hope the village would be safe until the order gets lifted.{nl}The elders left here since they said they can't leave the village.
How can they ask us to gather at the place where monsters are going crazy... {nl}The lord is asking us for too much.
After the order to move out, we didn't move with the villagers.{nl}I think the people who have left before us would probably be at the 8th district by now.{nl}Can you bring those people back here?
{nl}Even if we group together with the people of Romanas Elder,{nl}this place seems safer than the 8th district...
I know that this place has been prepared for us, but I didn't expect it to be this dangerous...
Thank you. I should ask Romanas before our elder comes here that{nl}if I can be here.
I've heard a lot that a mysterious man is helping my people.{nl}I heard that he is a person who receives lots of respect from others.{nl}It is well known that he helped them while the kingdom and the lord didn't do anything.{nl}He is like a hero sent by the goddesses.
{nl}I have a request for a hero like him.{nl}In Orsha, our residents have someone{nl}whom they rely on spiritually more than the lord.
{nl}Urbonas is someone who we all need to recover Orsha which was torn in pieces.{nl}But, lately, I can't see him.{nl}He disappeared with his priests without any words.{nl}My agents are looking for the whereabouts of Urbonas.
{nl}I want to request to help finding the whereabouts of Urbonas.{nl}Without anybody knowing...
A big chaos would result if the residents find out about this.{nl}The order to move out came down late already and various villages were attacked by the monsters.{nl}If they find out that Urbonas disappeared, it would be hard to control Orsha.
Lately, one of his disciples, Pranas came back.{nl}To listen for more details, I talked with him, but Pranas also doesn't know why.{nl}He is busy looking for whereabouts of Urbonas.{nl}My subordinates and the hired chasers are searching the Woods of the Linked Bridges and Paupys Crossing.
{nl}But, there is no more progress due to the outrageous monsters.{nl}We need your help.
We must look for Urbonas.{nl}In this world, where even the goddesses do not answer, the only one we can rely on is Urbonas.
Urbonas is cooperating with my family.{nl}Recently, there are reports that demons are appearing from the Woods of the Linked Bridges and Paupys Crossing.{nl}I can't tell you for sure, but I don't have a good feeling on this.{nl}For Orsha and its residents, can you look for the whereabouts of Urbonas?
Thanks for helping us.{nl}Please visit the Goddess Statue before you leave.{nl}The Goddess Statues will be a guide that will be needed in your journeys.
{nl}And although not big, I've told the item merchant so you can receive some goods from the merchant.{nl}May the luck with you on your journey.
You should never tell the residents that the bishop has disappeared.
I've heard from the bishop.{nl}You are telling others that you are the hero sent by the goddesses while helping the residents outside right?
{nl}Please receive these goods!
After the capital city has been destroyed, there are not many intact cities in this kingdom.{nl}Either Klaipeda or Fedimian...{nl}If you need any potions or tools in the future, you will meet me often.
{nl}And it seems that the lord has requested something to the Accessory Merchant,{nl}so you better meet the merchant.
Travelers are coming to Orsha since it is relatively safe.{nl}The world has collapsed, but I am making more money than before..{nl}Isn't it ironic?{nl}
Hello! I really wanted to meet you.{nl}I've hard that you saved my friends.{nl}I haven't prepared a lot, but since the bishop also told me, I will give you this!
{nl}{nl}And it seems that the bishop is looking for you.{nl}Please hurry!
Are you ready to leave? I've received a message from the agent that was searching at the Woods of the Linked Bridges.{nl}It seems that he found some clues about the whereabouts of the bishop and his company.{nl}If you are ready, meet with Cherasia at the Woods Linked Bridges.
You seem to be the one who the elder was talking about.{nl}Nice to meet you. I am Cherasia.{nl}I am looking for whereabouts of Urbonas and the priests here.
I've told the residents that the agents were dispatched outside to protect the areas so I want you to also act as if you don't know anything so that the efforts of the agents do not end in vain.
The search activities didn't end in vain.{nl}I am sure that you must have heard about Pranas from the elder.{nl}Pranas, the guy who had gone for trainings in the northern area and came back recently.
{nl}We've found some traces of the Priest Irma who is one of the disciples of the bishop here.{nl}And from the traces that were discovered, the memo that looked beloging to Iruma was ripped in pieces.{nl}When you look at the shape how it was ripped off, it seems that the monsters bit them.
{nl}That's why I've caught the monsters and retrieving the pages of the memo...{nl}But, that's too much work for me.{nl}Can you defeat the monsters at the 1st district and get me the pages of the Priest Irma?
Pranas has left first to look for the traces of Urbonas with other officers.
It has been stained due to the body fluid of the monsters so its hard to recognize it, but{nl}As I read it, it's about being chansed by something.{nl}We better hurry up.
{nl}Take this and meet Pranas at the northen region.{nl}I will look for the other traces here.
I am an agent, Moren.{nl}So you are the one who the bishop talked about.{nl}If Iruma is being chased after, that means the bishop is also being chased after right?{nl}I am looking for the place where the bishop and his company stayed.
{nl}Due to the monsters nearby, I can't investigate exactly.{nl}While I am checking the bonfire here, can you defeat the monsters that are disturbing us around here?{nl}
The investigation has not been done yet.
You found a sheet of paper that looks blackened by something.{nl}So this is the memo.. How come they burnt it like this?{nl}It seems that the travelers here didn't do this.{nl}Someone extinguished the bonfire and covered it with the lump of grass...
{nl}What if it catches the fire...
You told me that the Priest Irma is being chased after by something right?{nl}Then, this blackened paper is to hide something from the chasers.{nl}No matter what the reason is, we need to collect these.
{nl}As I am looking at the memo here, please look through the lumps of grass that have smoke on them{nl}and collect the memos that are half burnt.{nl}If you could collect them, I will analyze them for you.
I am sure that they didn't light them up since they were being chased after...{nl}Are they lit up to deceive someone?
Good. Let's analyze them now.
{nl}Folklore...{nl}The Hamondale family...{nl}The Revelator...
{nl}The Revelator? what is the Revelator doing anyways?{nl}We better go meet Pranas fast.{nl}Please go to the northern area.{nl}I will continue the rest of the search here.
You are looking for Pranas? Pranas has left to Paupys Crossing.{nl}He told me to look for the traces of the priests from the 5th district.{nl}There is some camp located there, but there are so many monsters which I can't face alone.{nl}I tried to defeat some of them, but since they all rushed into me after that, it is so hard for me to go there again.
{nl}{nl}If you are okay, can you search the 5th district?
If what Moren is thinking is true, that means this place is full of monsters by now.{nl}Do you believe the Revelator really exists even when the goddesses disappeared?{nl}I don't think so.
{nl}The agents have too many worries.{nl}Orsha is very far away from the place where demons are appearing...{nl}Don't worry.{nl}The bishop must have went somewhere since he is bored.
Contents of Urbonas' journal (metaphorical content){nl}- A turbulent era was approaching and it was time to face the destiny our order had been preparing for centuries.{nl}- I can only hope Orsha remains safe until my priests and I can complete this task.{nl}- That sent by the goddesses... (end of content)
I've seen the flame roaring to the sky. Are you saying the demons really appeared?{nl}What's wrong with the diary of the bishop? It's too confusing.{nl}We better go back to Pranas.{nl}Go back to Paupys Crossing at the north!
I think he's almost here by now.{nl}I've heard about it from the agent of the lord.{nl}
I should have just stayed in my hometown and live by hunting.{nl}Demons!{nl}My mother would faint out if she finds out that I am chasing after demons.
I am helping the agents here so they can carry out their duties.{nl}If you get a chance to go to the 1st district, I want you to defeat the monsters there,{nl}so that the activities of the officers there would not get disturbed.
I was actually working here for a different mission.{nl}Recently, many problems occurred including the disappearance of the priests,{nl}so my task to find out why the monsters were heading to Orsha got delayed.
We want monsters not to group together.{nl}Thanks.
Recently, the monsters are coming near Orsha.{nl}So to find out what happened to them,{nl}they put all the monsters into a wagon and put them at the 2nd district.
{nl}But, due to another matter, the wagon was abandoned and it is spreading the bad odor.{nl}Because of that, the monsters are going even more crazy.
One of the principles of the agents is that they check it with their hands and their tongues.{nl}That's why we know a lot of poison water and monsters.
The monsters don't usually rush into the place where the fire started so we don't have to worry about this place.{nl}Thank you for helping me.
Lots of chasers came to hometown after getting hired.{nl}I never thought Orsha would be big like this.{nl}So I've brought a funny good from my hometown.
{nl}Do you want to use this monster stimulant?{nl}It seems that you are receiving requests from lots of people,{nl}so if you use this, you would be able to do some of those tasks easier.
When you sprinkle this monster stimulant to the monsters, the monsters may attack my allies,{nl}but, if there are no allies around, they may attack humans.
How was it? If the effects are good, I should make some of them and sell them at Orsha.{nl}I've worked as a merchant before the world turned out like this so I know what's worth of making money.
The agents have left for the another task so they want me to do the investigation on their behalf.{nl}They want me to investigate the Woods of the Linked Bridges.{nl}I think they are trying to hide the refugees from the north around here..{nl}I guess they don't have enough force.
According to what the agent told me who handed over the task to me, the most suspicious area is the 5th district.{nl}It seems that they also handed over some task to you.. if you are going to the 5th district, can you get rid of the monsters and their habitats?
I am getting paid for doing this... Why are you doing this for?{nl}Well... if you want to just have some experiences, I guess that's not that bad after all..
Damn... the monsters set up their nests in this normal looking forest too...{nl}This is... difficult...
Pranas has left to the northern region with other agents first.{nl}I am looking for the traces of the Priest, Gelliya who was discovered here.{nl}But, its so hard for me to search here due to the attributes of the monsters since they are different from the ones in our hometown.{nl}Can you help me getting the pages of Gelliya's memo by defeating the monsters?
{nl}This memo should possess some decisive evidence.{nl}The traces that are being left by the ones who run away since they want others to find them.
I was not going to think too much about the safety of Orsha if I can continue to get paid.. {nl}But, after seeing the demons that are appearing here, I remember my hometown.
Thanks. Because it is ripped in pieces, I can't check exactly what's written..{nl}It seems that a few disciples went missing while running away.{nl}It is written that the disciples of the bishop are feeling uneasy.{nl}More than anything, it seems that the demons were hiding various places in the forest and they were going after them.
We better let Pranas know about it. Go to the 3rd district.{nl}While going there, please also stop by at the camp in the 2nd district and check whether there are other traces.{nl}
If he went missing at the place where the demons are located..{nl}It is so unfortunate, but you won't see those priests again..
So you are the one who the lord talked about. I am telling about you to the agents here.{nl}I was actually going to see Pranas, but I was taking a rest since Jali got too tired.{nl}It seems that Jali got too excited since there is some place here where the bishop and his company used to stay.
{nl}Jali was the dog that was being raised by Urbonas.{nl}I thought I would find it quicker if I use the olfactory sense of Jali.{nl}If you are looking for the bishop's company, why don't you take Jali with you?{nl}For Pranas, he would need even slightest clues.
I hope there's a dog like Jali at the agents' camp as well.{nl}It is cute, it follows people's orders well and most of all, it searches really well.
Did Jali find something?{nl}It is certain that there were lots of people around here.
I am worried because I heard some screaming sound from the north side of the trails.{nl}Can you first go to the 8th district?
If I find Pranas, I would have to go back to Orsha and be prepared.{nl}Agents usually spend the time by wandering around...
What are you doing here, Run away!
What? You've come here to look for Pranas?{nl}Then, we are too late. Pranas was attacked by the demons at the 5th district.{nl}I should've brought the agents.
{nl}When I met his eyes, all we can do was to run away.{nl}Pranas will be in danger if it continues like this!{nl}Help us!
There's nothing we can do.{nl}If Pranas gets attacked, the bishop's disappearance will go into mystery forever...
Damn..{nl}Who are you? You've saved me.{nl}One or two demons were wandering around so I was going to search the camp, but{nl}the boss suddenly appeared..
So the elder sent you?{nl}Then you must know that the bishop has already disappeared..{nl}I can't even control myself so it's hard for me to continue the search activities.{nl}Can you look around here on behalf of me?
{nl}If this place doesn't exist, we may have to go to the forest in the north that turned into a ruin.{nl}I am worried since there are more dangerous monsters out there..
If you find something, please come look for me at Orsha.{nl}I am counting on you..
I took some rest and as a result, I got better.{nl}Have you found something?
With the agents, I am helping the chasers who were hired to search Paupys Crossing and do the investigation.{nl}But, it's too hard for me to do it alone.{nl}If you get a chance to cross the 1st district, please tell me after defeating the monsters there.{nl}Then, I will pass your good intentions to the elder.
I was called here during my vacation so I don't know what's going on.
You've defeated that many?{nl}Are the ones from the outside all strong like you?
I haven't found out exactly why the demons are wandering around here, but..{nl}there are many magic circles wihch the demons have set up at the 2nd district.{nl}If you get a chance to visit the 2nd district, can you get rid of those?
When I came here last time due to the problem of the settlers.. there were nothing like this..{nl}What's going on?
I don't understand why they set this up.{nl}It doesn't seem to have any damages.. It is stragne.
The villagers in the north would start to emigrate soon.{nl}The lord is thinking about making them stay near the 4th district.{nl}The villagers in the north are aggressive and there are elders who were once mercenaries so if there is a camp for them{nl}they think they can protect themselves.
{nl}So they told me to check whether those monsters are the ones we can handle ourselves{nl}I am a person who actually write documents and putting stamps on the documents instead of doing investigations so this is too much task for me.{nl}I heard that you are very strong. Can you check 4/5 districts?
I never held a sword except for when I joind the squad so I don't understand why they are sending us to this kind of place..{nl}The lord is asking too much.
Are you saying that a gigantic monster appeared at the camp?{nl}I haven't seen with my own eyes, but I can't tell others to stay theree.{nl}You agree right? I will count on you and report.
We are facing a difficult situation.{nl}The demons which I saw in the books may appear at the place where I was dispatched..{nl}This is too much for me.{nl}And due to the demons that I haven't seen, the monsters may have gone violent..{nl}How can they ask me to extract the blood from the monsters...
If you get a chance to visit 5th district, could you defeat the monsters there and collect their blood?
I am not a coward.{nl}I just know my place.{nl}I don't fight with a sword or a spear, but rather with pens and stamps..
What is this disgusting odor?{nl}I don't know why he ordered me to collect these.{nl}He knows well..
It's too hard for me to survive by just hunting these days so I came down this far.{nl}We should live on.{nl}In this place, we won't survive even if we have more than 10 lives.
{nl}We were injured and we don't know when the monsters and the demons would go after us.{nl}While we are recovering, can you defeat the monsters around?{nl}Since we don't have any one who is okay, I have no one to request other than you.
I want to swear to the ones who took me here.
I think I have some problem on my legs or ankles.{nl}If you didn't help me, I am sure that I would have been attacked.{nl}Thank you.
Have you seen any bags or luggages around here?{nl}While we were away, the monsters took the goods of the chasers and the agents{nl}and ran away.
{nl}If you get a chance to go to 8th district, can you look for our luggages?
I am hurt and lost my luggages..{nl}Before you asked me to help me, I didn't have any excuses so I didn't know what to do.
Thank you so much! Althugh I haven't retrived them all, I think I now have something to say!
I can now barely manage ourselves.{nl}This is all because of your help.{nl}Although I am not good, I translated the diary of the bishop so do you want to listen to it?
When I translate the diary of the bishop, I can read something like this.
{nl}{nl}If the world goes into a chaos, an outsider who was assigned by the goddesses would visit Orsha.{nl}But, that outsider would come in with other outsiders.{nl}It is our destiny to find and guide him.{nl}Among many outsiders, we should look for the one who we are looking for.
{nl}Before we are even ready, the demons are chasing after the right.{nl}I am heading to the Ashaq Underground Prison with my priests.{nl}There, I will wait for the Revelator.
{nl}{nl}We didn't have enough time to pass it to Inessa and the priests who went outside.{nl}If someone discovers this diary, please hand it over to Inesa Hamondale.
{nl}{nl}I understand now.{nl}Being chased after the demons! That's a big problem.{nl}We better let the lord know this!
Urbonas was being chased after the demons!{nl}Ashaq Underground Prison was closed for a long time.{nl}I don't know what they are trying to do..
{nl}Someone must go there now!
I will get ready to go to Ashaq Underground Prison.{nl}I want you to tell this to the lord fast!
It would take long time to send my subordinates there.{nl}I am sorry, but can you go to Ashaq Underground Prison where Pranas and Urbonas are located?{nl}I can't move so I feel stuffy..
If you are the Revelator which Urbonas talked about, we better go meet Urbonas fast.{nl}However, even if you are busy, you should be well prepared so go meet the item merchant.{nl}I've prepared goods which you would be able to use well.
{nl}If your preparation gets completed, don't come to me, but please rather meet Pranas and head to Ashaq Underground Prison!
I've prepared it fast since the lord sent the people.{nl}I should give you a better good, but since we are in a hurry, please use it.{nl}When you use an anvil, you would be able to enhance your weapon.
If the demons hurt Urbonas, then the next target will be Orsha.{nl}We should do our best to save Urbonas!
Your words are correct.{nl}The northern region where I used to stay became a ruin due to the demons.{nl}Probably, the next location will be the southern region.
{nl}Orsha is the base of the southern part of the kingdom.{nl}I am sure that the demons would do something.{nl}Please go to Ashaq Underground Prison with me to save Urbonas!
I am gonna go to ask for help to the chasers.{nl}If you are ready, please come to xx region that leads to Ashaq Underground Prison at Paupys Crossing.
They are all experienced chasers who would help me.{nl}But, it's not going to enough do it just by us.{nl}It is so fortunate that you came with us.{nl}
I can feel some ominous energy coming from the direction of the Underground Prison.{nl}If you are ready, let's head to Ashaq Underground Prison.
I will first leave with the chasers.{nl}Please follow us right away.
It feels like something unknown is suffocating me.{nl}I can't even breathe.{nl}By the way, are you okay?
{nl}By seeing that you are free inside, I guess the goddesses really take care of you.
I've been to this place a few times when I was doing training in the past.{nl}But, I never felt like something is suffocating me.{nl}Same with that ominous fog.
{nl}Since you seem safe, can you go to the 2nd district and{nl}check what's going on?
This feeling is like a curse.
I've never seen an icon with a shape like that.{nl}I think the demons have some other objective.{nl}I can't do anything at the moment so I am very grateful{nl}that you've destroyed the icon for me.
{nl}There is a possibility that the bishop and his brothers are hiding in the hidden room.{nl}Since we can't do anything, you should go there alone.{nl}Are you going to be okay?
If possible, I want you to eliminate all the icons.{nl}If they remain, we can't run away even if our brothers are alive.
This place is old and mazed so if we go into a wrong way, we may not be able to go up.{nl}Please be careful.
So you've come here with Pranas?{nl}You've entered into a deadly place in order to save me.. I am too sorry to see my dead disciples.{nl}Recently, when my disciple, Iruma was doing training, he found a sheet of order.{nl}It contained the plans of the demons to annihilate Orsha.
{nl}I gathered my disciples and met with Irma to try and analyze the document.{nl}But since then we've been constantly under attack by the demons.{nl}The document says that Demon Goddess Giltine is trying to kill all Revelators. {nl}So our order came here to hide and prepare to meet and guide the destined Revelator.
{nl}{nl}We had no way of telling Lord Inesa, however.{nl}If we left any traces the demons would find us and we thought that would be the end of us.{nl}My disciples and I ended up hiding here, trying to avoid the demons.{nl}But there was something we missed.
{nl}We were being chased by no ordinary demon, but a Demon Lord.{nl}This Demon Lord, Marnox, set up statues of himself to control the prison{nl} and had his vassals close in on us to keep us from escaping.{nl}We thought soon it would be over for us.
{nl}The priests are hiding in levels 2F and 3F.{nl}A few priests went missing, and Irma and I met Marnox trying to escape from the hidden room where we hid the Demon Orders.{nl}Irma was caught by Marnox, while I managed to escape and was ready to die by now.
{nl}But if Inesa sent you here, there is still hope.{nl}There is no doubt you are the Revelator we have been waiting for.
If you are a Revelator, step onto our magic circle.{nl}If your status is confirmed, then you can face the Demon Lord.
Don't be afraid.{nl}The goddesses will lead your way.
The efforts of our order were not in vain.{nl}Revelator...
{nl}Only you can face Demon Lord Marnox now.{nl}Please, save our priests and the people of Orsha.
Revelator, thanks to you destroying the statues Pranas is now able to move.{nl}I'm old and will be nothing but a burden to you; go with Pranas and Irma and save the priests.{nl}Please.
I can't escape on my own and leave the priests behind.{nl}We need to find the Demon Orders. {nl}We need to analyze it and figure out the demons' invasion plans.
The bishop is alive!{nl}I'm so glad to hear that.{nl}And you really are a Revelator.{nl}The goddesses are on our side.
There's a sinister energy hanging over this place.{nl}Still, I want to be useful to our employer...{nl}I know you must be busy, but if you're headed to region 1, will you{nl}defeat some demons there and get something for me?{nl}Something safe.
You seem to be in better condition than us.
I don't know what they'll do with this but at least it won't look like I'm slacking off on the job.{nl}Thank you.
All the agents outside asked me to get something for them.{nl}Honestly I have no interest in these things...{nl}But since they asked I guess I'll have to do it.
{nl}I'm going to look for what I can; if you happen to face some demons in region 2{nl}will you get something from them, too?
Isn't it better to capture the demons instead, though?{nl}That is, assuming you can catch them, of course.
A wooden piece.{nl}Is it an amulet? I wonder what they can do with this...{nl}Well, it's better than nothing.
I hear from the agents that the demons have a kind of sack they carry around with them.{nl}I wonder if these sacks don't have something to do with how they can live in these terrible conditions.{nl}If you go to region 3, get some after you defeat the demons and try and use the sacks.{nl}Who knows, they could be useful for yourself, too.
I came to help with the maintenance work but look at what almost happened.{nl}You really can't trust anyone outside the church.
This could be very useful.{nl}I ought to show it to the agents as soon as I get outside.
So the brothers are all hiding in the level below.{nl}Let's go, then.
If Draznie and Auranas are safe, that means the other brothers can still be alive.{nl}But it's the same thing here.{nl}There's cursed idols everywhere.{nl}We really need to get rid of them as soon as we can...{nl}
According to Draznie, there's a cursed totem in region 2.{nl}Will you take it down?{nl}It will be easier to look for Irma in region 3 after that.
The bishop is very fond of Irma.{nl}She needs to be alive...
You destroyed the statue?{nl}It's such a relief to hear that.
Now please look for traces of Irma in region 3.{nl}Let us hope she's still alive...
Revelator, you are the only one our order can depend on.{nl}The same goes for the Lord and the residents of Orsha.
What happened...?{nl}I thought the Demon Lord had killed me...{nl}Where are we?
So the statues were the reason why we couldn't move.{nl}I saw them in regions 4 and 5 when the bishop and I were trying to avoid the Demon Lord.{nl}The ones I saw looked a little different, but it seems like Marnox set them up to spy on us.
{nl}Will you take down the statues in regions 4 and 5?{nl}If we don't, no matter where we go we will never escape from Marnox's grip...
Before I was caught by the Demon Lord, the bishop told me all about the fate of our order.{nl}Revelator, I am truly glad to have met you.
Irma went down to the third floor.{nl}She told me to send you there when you came back.
{nl}I don't think I can move from here.{nl}I'm afraid you'll have to go on your own.
Irma said she was going to the third floor to find Gelija.{nl}She's Irma's sister so I couldn't even try to stop her.{nl}She knows we can't do anything without you here,{nl}I don't know why she's acting like this.
{nl}Find Irma before the Demon Lord finds her again.
Irma told me.{nl}That you came all the way here from Orsha to find us.{nl}I'm not afraid now that I know a Revelator is with us.
Irma is too reckless and that's a problem.
The bishop was very worried.{nl}There were of course many places to meet with a Revelator other than here.{nl}Draznie and I were in charge of this prison so we made a lot of preparations for a future crisis here.
{nl}Originally we simply planned to avoid any difficult enemies, but since you're here{nl}we should make use of our hidden tools.{nl}I left some bags of pearl powder in region 1.{nl}If you collect this powder we can use it against the demons.{nl}I'll tell you how after you bring back the powder.
Once again I'm in awe with our bishop's sense of foresight.{nl}If he hadn't prepared this we would have been left at the hands of the demons.{nl}I hope the missing brothers are at the other hideouts we prepared.
This is more than enough.{nl}Thank you.
The demons aren't simple monsters; they seem to have a command hierarchy.{nl}The stronger ones commanding the weaker ones.{nl}I wonder if defeating the strong ones won't make it easier to take down the rest.
{nl}Take this pearl powder and use it whenever you see a demon.{nl}The light coming from the power will point to the strongest demon monsters so you can tell who they are.
We still don't know if someone's leading the demons{nl}but if we take them down one by one won't the world become safe again?
Thank you.{nl}Did you deal well with the demons?{nl}There are many other things prepared but this is all I have...{nl}Draznie will have to take care of the rest.
Auranas and I found several safe spots around this prison.{nl}Of course the one where we are now is not one of them.{nl}I was hiding in region 3 but the Demon Lord came with his vassals to look around the area.{nl}I had to leave all my things behind and escape.
{nl}We should find that spot again if we're going to stay here a little longer...{nl}But as you can see all we can do is run.{nl}If that's fine with you, will you clear out region 3?
I guess the demons didn't expect us to be hiding there...
{nl}The problem is we didn't expect them to go all the way there either.
Thank you.{nl}I should have a look around and hide in region 3 again.
In region 4 there are several small rooms.{nl}I made traps in them with the technique I learned while working in the northern region. {nl}The have an image of me to lure the enemy.
{nl}But I can't go all the way there.{nl}If it's fine with you, will you go there and activate the traps?
I have several other traps and hideouts outside this prison.{nl}I prepared enough for everyone in case something happens to Orsha.
Did it work well on the demons?{nl}I had never used it on demons before, so I was worried.{nl}But I'm glad to hear it went well.
Go see Irma now.{nl}She's preparing to take back the Demon Orders.
I'm sorry for disappearing without notice.{nl}It was urgent. While you were destroying the surveillance statue{nl}I managed to escape without Marnox noticing.{nl}But it seems he has more statues here, too.
Many brothers were sacrificed to reach where we are.{nl}Because this is the only path we can take.{nl}Please, stop the demons.
To enter the hidden room and get the orders, you'll have to destroy the statue in region 2. {nl}But remember not to use a transport device in its range or Marnox will catch you.{nl}Can you do it?
This is strange, he should be here any minute now...{nl}Are you afraid?
This is very strange.{nl}Why isn't Marnox here?{nl}From his behaviour so far, I would assume he'd come...
If Marnox doesn't come, there's nothing we can do.{nl}Just in case, I think it would be good to destroy the statue in region 3 to provoke him.{nl}As long as he lives we will never be able to open the door to the hidden room.
The bishop can't have been found, can he? {nl}I remember he acted so brazen when he had me caught, nothing like now.{nl}I remember how lowly he regarded priests like me...{nl}Revelator, are you afraid?
He might have sent his vassals and escaped, he could be making other plans.{nl}We can't waste any more time, let's open the door.
I'll open the door and you'll enter the room. {nl}Let's get the orders and go back to the bishop immediately.
You defeated Marnox...{nl}I don't think I will be able to move for a while.
It was an honor defending the fate of our order until the end.{nl}It was all thanks to you.{nl}I'm going to hide here and recover, you take the orders and go see the bishop.
Do you mean you defeated Marnox?{nl}A Demon Lord... You truly have the power of a Revelator.{nl}I'm glad the priests are safe...{nl}I will talk to Inesa and make sure those who are missing return to their homes.
People will remember you when Orsha prospers once again...
I'm going to return to Orsha and work on the Demon Orders analysis.{nl}You go see the Lord and tell her about Marnox and us.{nl}My disciples are staying here to make sure there's no traces of Marnox left and to find the missing priests.
So the demons reached the areas surrounding Orsha.{nl}We were always wary of demon invasions, but we never thought we'd have to face a Demon Lord.{nl}If only I could praise your feat to the people...
{nl}I'm sorry. If I told everyone about it, it would only scare the residents.
I heard about what happened.{nl}Urbonas confirmed you are a Revelator sent by the goddesses.{nl}It is an honor to meet the hero of the legend passed down in our family.{nl}It seems the goddesses haven't left us yet.{nl}What are your plans now?
{nl}For now, you should go see Urbonas.{nl}He's looking for you.
Please think of Orsha as your second home.{nl}I and the residents of Orsha are always glad to welcome you.
Welcome. We were just finishing the analysis. {nl}There's a few parts here and there we can't agree on, but here's what we have.
{nl}{nl}(Demon Orders analysis)
We mustn't assume all the missing brothers are dead.{nl}But to find them we need to destroy Marnox's statues.{nl}Would you take care of that?
Someone has to be alive...
Thank you.{nl}I'll go find them as soon as I recover from my injuries.
There's no way to know where the brothers are hiding in this prison...{nl}And there'll be priests that won't be able to return to their families even after all of this is over...{nl}I wish I could bring them their belongings at least.
{nl}Several priests went missing in region 2.{nl}Will you look for their bags there?
Not all of the bags will belong to missing people.{nl}I lost mine too, after all...
Thank you. You found my bag that was lost, too.{nl}Seeing the diaries inside the bags makes me think many of the brothers are still alive. {nl}We need to find them before it's too late.
There's a reason you cover your hands when you throw away something dirty.{nl}Priest Irma destroyed Marnox's cursed idols when she was running away from him.{nl}But now their remains are spread aroun all overd.{nl}Their energy could still come back and hurt us.
{nl}Here's a cloth soaked in holy water. Use it to get rid of what remains of the statue.{nl}Cover the fragments with the cloth and the power of the holy water will make them disappear.
Rushing anything is bound to end in trouble eventually.
That's one less thing to worry about. {nl}Although, with how the demons left this place, it's going be a while before it can be back to normal.
Would you go to the Uzali Crossroads and hunt some Green Lepusbunny Assassins?{nl}We could use their warm fur.
Around here there are Blue Siaulav Mages that carry emergency food.{nl}Horace probably told you their food is surprisingly edible. Could you get some for me?
It's funny, if it weren't for them I would have starved by now.{nl}Because of the cold, the only thing that grows around here are potatoes.
First we need to do something about the heat.{nl}Horace once said that Blue Lapasape mushrooms generate heat; I want to test them.
Let's see if you're skilled, then.{nl}Go to Paupys Crossing and take down ten Lapflammers and ten Lapemans.
You seem strong enough already.{nl}I just need to check how well you're able to use that strength of yours.
Good. You have fulfilled the most basic condition.{nl}Us Peltasta are a class that uses the shield actively against our opponents. {nl)As such, you're required to have a basic understanding of it.
I'm going to ask you for some materials for your shield.{nl}First you can go to Paupys Crossing and collect metal decorations from Lapemans.{nl}Also, gather some dry wood from an isolated worshop there.
You did well.{nl}Now gather all the materials you need and craft your own shield.
I'm simply following the Master's important orders.{nl}That doesn't mean I'm jealous of you for being a traveler!
Of course, first you'll have to prove you can handle advanced techniques.
Take this and defeat the monsters in Bracken Forest 63_3.{nl}You'll see the numbers here go up the more enemies you defeat.{nl}Demons are worth twice the points.
There are a few conditions, though.{nl}One, you must defeat the enemy with a shield equipped. {nl}Two, if you become incapable of combat, the enemies you defeated until then will not count.
{nl}Finally, you have to defeat the monsters without any help from your allies.
Defeat monsters with your shield equipped. {nl}This will prove your survival skills.{nl}Note that catching demons will be more effective.
Teaching you how to use the spear is easy, what's important is your attitude.{nl}There's a place that's just right for learners like you.
The most important virtue of a warrior is their sense of combat.{nl}That means attacking anything that's hostile to what you're trying to protect.{nl}Give it a try; defeat the Yognomes in Bracken Forest 63_3.
Did you hear?{nl}Some of the refugees that were coming to Orsha got hurt around the Lemprasa Pond and were left behind.{nl}They need to be rescued!
I'm glad nothing worse happened to them.{nl}It was all thanks to your help.{nl}I think it's clear you're ready to move on to the final level of Cleric.
The first herbs you will find in the XXX region under piles of leaves.{nl}The second herbs grow in the YY region.{nl}The third are blooming yellow flowers in region ZZ; they should be the easiest to find.
The master herself, too, got in after making her own Bokor doll.{nl}I guess you can say it's part of our history and tradition.
I would say this is a very high quality Bokor doll!{nl}It really seems like you're a natural. {nl}Now you too are a Bokor. Welcome!
What is it?
Oh... if you mean a strong-willed Dievdirbys, yes, I know her.{nl}But I'm afraid I'm at a loss here. I have no chisel or any materials to make one.
Alright. Then prove you're ready to learn some advanced techniques.{nl}Show me how much you've mastered the basics.
Any monster is fine, as long as you use your Highlander techniques to defeat them.{nl}Do this without the help of your colleagues.
Looks like you have no problems in defeating demons.{nl}But you still need some practice for the more vicious ones.{nl}I can show you the way of a true Peltasta.
If you meet the requirements, that is.
I once was asked to get rid of the Chapparition in Karolis Springs.{nl}I couldn't finish the job at the time but now I think it could be a good test for you.{nl}Go to Karolis Springs and defeat the Chapparition there.
I'm surprised by how much you improved.{nl}I can tell you're different from other Hoplites. {nl}You'll have no problems in becoming even stronger. So, are you ready for the next stage?
Yes, that's the end of the spear I used to attack it back then.{nl}Now we can finally say it was us the Hoplites who defeated the beast.
And of course, don't ask your friends to help you with this.
I like your guts.{nl}Do me a favor and defeat the demons in Feretory Hills.
After Medzio Diena, Feretory Hills has been crawling with demons.{nl}Go and defeat the demons there.
Take this gem and go to Feretory Hills.{nl}After you injure the monsters, use the power of the gem to purify them.{nl}Then, bring back their ashes.
This effectively proves your skills. {nl}Congratulations on reaching the last level of Krivis.{nl}I hope you will keep using your power to help those in need.
Go to Braken Monastery 64_2 and you will see Sparnasman monsters.{nl}Defeat them in the XXX region and bring me their horns.
I'm going to give you my energy.{nl}Use the energy at Feretory Hills and it will blend in with part of the monsters' spirits.
Defeat the monsters with my energy imparted to collect their spirits, then bring them to me. {nl}Do this without the help of anyone.
You seem ready.{nl}If so, go to the Apsimesti Crossroads without your shield and defeat the monsters there.
You know you need to do this on your own, right?
Are you any good with the spear now?{nl}If so, ger ready to become a true Cataphract.{nl}How's you companion's condition?
Good. Imagine your arms are the spear that'll strike your opponents.{nl}And your legs are the companion that moves you around.{nl}Go to the Apsimesti Crossroads and defeat your enemies while mounted on your companion.
I received a letter from Tesla!{nl}From what he wrote he seems to expect great things from you.{nl}Let's see if you've improved enough to live up to his expectations.
The cities may be far from each other but there's always a fast way.{nl}Good luck.
Thake this relic and go to Starving Demon's Way.{nl}Activate it at the Abandoned Altar in Hyth Cliff and the monsters will appear.{nl}I assume you know what to do next?
The Abandoned Altar is by Hith Cliff in Starving Demon's Way.
Good job. You're one step closer to the next level.{nl}I would be glad to introduce your talent to my uncle; he's busy working as a Master.
At last, you're a true Rodelero now.{nl}But do you have what it takes to be a leader?{nl}Why don't you give it a try on the Colimencias at the Greene Manor?
You're going to feel overwhelmed.{nl}But you need to know your weaknesses before you can reach the next Rodelero level.
What was it like fighting such a strong opponent? Do you feel fit for a Rodelero?{nl}You're already a true Rodelero if you ask me.{nl}Keep up the good work.{nl}
To become the best Cataphract you need a worthy opponent.{nl}The Gaigalas in Tenants' Farm and known for being the fiercest and most savage.{nl}Go there and defeat some.
What you did was very impressive.{nl}As a Sadhu Master I look forward to your progress.
You've improved quite a bit.{nl}It's time for you to be tested for the final stage.{nl}We need a way to prove your skills.
And I think I know just the one.{nl}They say the Gaigalas in Tenants' Farm are some of the most unruly.{nl}Go there and defeat some to make sure they don't harm anyone else.
I wondered if it wasn't too dangerous, but it seems I underestimated you.{nl}You're very impressive.{nl}I don't think anyone would doubt you're fit to become a high-level Paladin.
Stop.
Start!
Start?
Stop?
I thought we might find Goddess Zemyna here but all I see are the dead...{nl}I've never seen anything like this. We need to find Zemyna.
So we can't get near the relic...{nl}I understand keeping monsters and demons away, but why it's protected against people I don't know.
What was that?{nl}It's so good to be safe again. I nearly returned to the goddess.{nl}
I should've known... it wasn't a relic of the goddess at all.{nl}
I'm going to give you my records.{nl}Take them and destroy them; only then can I finally be at peace.
I don't think... I've seen you before.{nl}
Hm... That's good.{nl}If you can, will you please help me?{nl}
I came running after the ferrets who stole our food and ended up here.{nl}But the ferrets attacked me and I couldn't get the food.{nl}
I need some first aid for my wounds...{nl}There's a herb at the Luvda Cliff that helps stop bleeding. Will you get some for me?
The ferrets might attack again.{nl}These days it's like they think everything in the forest belongs to them.
Thank you so much for this favor.{nl}I'm going to get some rest and then go back to the workshop where the other people are.{nl}
You're telling me you saw a girl being chased by a demon with an axe?{nl}That demon is probably Zaura; the girl I don't know.{nl}
And he wants to stop the girl from meeting the Revelator...?{nl}
That sounds suspicious.{nl}I need to tell the village about this.{nl}
What?{nl}You're a Revelator?{nl}
Did you come here after dreaming about a calamity?{nl}
I wonder if...?{nl}I think you might just be the Revelator told in the story of our village.{nl}
The story says... that when chaos takes over our village, a Revelator will dream of a calamity and come.{nl}They and their divine light will chase away evil and save the village.{nl}
Those are the words of Goddess Laima that have been passed down.{nl}But... um...{nl}
This isn't the right time.{nl}First I'm going to ask our village chief about this story.{nl}
Meanwhile, please take back our food from the ferrets who stole it.{nl}You can bring it to our village chief at the Bellai Forest Workshop.{nl}
Our people don't really trust outsiders but...{nl}We can't turn our back on help.
Are you the Revelator Leja talked about?{nl}And that is... our stolen food.{nl}
Thank you for taking back our food but...{nl}I don't think I can trust you just yet.{nl}
Please understand.{nl}We were tricked by the demons once before, you see.
Leja said she had somewhere else to be and left.{nl}I can't tell you where she is going, though.{nl}
Like I said, we can't trust you just yet.{nl}
We once had someone come to our village calling himself a Revelator.{nl}It was a man with a pale face and long hair.{nl}
We thought our Revelator had finally arrived and did as the man said.{nl}Truth is, in reality... he was a demon.{nl}
We believed the demon and because of that Goddess Lada was taken away...{nl}Even the ferrets turned violent.{nl}
We think it was because of the totem the demon made us set up.{nl}We all want to join forces and rescue Goddess Lada, but we're worried about the ferret attacks.{nl}
We can't even go near the totem because of its evil energy.{nl}But if you really are a Revelator, I'm sure you can use your divine power to destroy the totem.{nl}
Show us.{nl}If you really are a Revelator...
Please understand.{nl}I know Leja is glad the Revelator is finally here but...{nl}
We've been fooled before, we can't help but be suspicious.
You... you're a true Revelator, there's no doubt about it.{nl}I feel so sorry for how I treated you earlier... Please forgive this old man.{nl}
Leja went to Zeraha to try and find something to help you.{nl}She said Goddess Laima will have left something prepared for the Revelator.{nl}
There is a big statue of Goddess Laima there. {nl}It was sculpted a long time ago when She was still at our village.{nl}
Oh, by the way... the girl came.{nl}Can I tell you about what happened in our village?{nl}
Our village has always worshiped Goddess Laima.{nl}One day, She had a vision of a calamity that would strike the kingdom in a future far away.{nl}
So, to stop this calamity, She decided to leave the village.{nl}Maybe She was worried about leaving us behind, so she had Goddess Lada look after us instead.{nl}
But unlike what Goddess Laima predicted, our village remained peaceful.{nl}
Then, unexpectedly, Medzio Diena happened.{nl}It was the calamity in Goddess Laima's vision.{nl}
We weren't too affected by Medzio Diena, but that wasn't the end of it.{nl}Not long after, the river turned red.{nl}
The river water caused terrible pain to everyone who drank it, and it made the fruit grow to an abnormal size.{nl}The fruit, just like the red water, was inedible.{nl}
As if that weren't enough, the demons then came and took Goddess Lada.{nl}Just as Laima predicted... chaos took over the village.{nl}
Leja probably told you... what Goddess Laima said to us.{nl}She said a Revelator would dream of the calamity and come with the light to chase away evil.
We aren't sure what She meant by the light, but...{nl}Our elders used to say that a warm energy filled the village when Goddess Laima was here.{nl}
It was all very quick.{nl}The moment that girl came to me, I felt the same warm energy our elders talked about.{nl}
The girl looked me straight in the eyes and, without a word, she nodded.{nl}Then she disappeared towards Zeraha.{nl}
Go, chase after the light.{nl}It can only have been sent here by Laima to guide you.{nl}
Please, for Goddess Lada... and our village.
That warm energy...{nl}Until the day I return to the goddess I will never be able to forget it.{nl}
Go now.{nl}Follow the light and you will see the girl once again.{nl}
Revelator, you didn't drink the red water, did you?{nl}I mean... If you had you probably wouldn't be here talking to me.{nl}
Just don't drink the red water no matter how thirsty you are.{nl}The pain will kill you.{nl}
The water is so toxic we can't even eat our fruit.{nl}It's not even the taste. When they first started to grow we were so glad but...{nl}
But then, one day I got lost around the Menacing Lowlands and I was really thirsty. {nl}Then I noticed some fruit juice that belonged to the ferrets.{nl}
I figured whether I died of thirst or at the hands of the ferrets I was doomed either way.{nl}So I drank the ferrets' juice and... I don't know, nothing happened.{nl}
I don't know what they did but it looked like a good substitute for water.{nl}The water in the wells is starting to turn red too, you see.{nl}
Would you get some of the ferrets' fruit juice?{nl}Please. We can't live with no water.
I drank it expecting to die but surprisingly I didn't.{nl}It even tasted good.
Wow, thank you.{nl}With this much juice I won't have to worry for quite some time.{nl}
But, um...{nl}Sigh, those dogged ferrets...
While you were getting the juice, the ferrets came and stole our food again.{nl}We get it back, they steal it... I'm fed up with this!{nl}
This has to stop.{nl}This time we need to put an end to the ferrets' bad habits.{nl}
We need to find the food and give it some red water "seasoning".{nl}They're all going to be rolling on the floor in pain after they eat it.{nl}
The water in the old well south from here is particularly red.{nl}Maybe you can spray the food with the water from there.{nl}
Oh, make sure you spray it on the meat jerky hidden in the Banaga Forest Trail.{nl}Ferrets love meat jerky.
We can't let them get away with this.{nl}We've put up with it long enough.
It's darker than the grass around it and has wider leaves.{nl}If you go to Luvda Cliff you'll recognize it right away.
I sure hope the ferrets won't come to steal our food again after this.{nl}It's a bit of a waste but... I hope they'll just eat it and leave us alone.
Are you the Revelator who destroyed the totem?{nl}I wanted to thank you. It made me feel terrible every time I looked at it...{nl}
Anyway, I went to check in on the ferrets and they're still vicious.{nl}It looks like the effects of the totem haven't faded yet.{nl}
Widas, a man from our village, said he was planning to do something...{nl}He is a talented Dievdirbys after all.{nl}
Will you ask Widas if the statue is finished?
The totem is at the Banaga Forest Trail.{nl}If you really are a Revelator here with the light to save our village, getting the ferrets back to normal should be within your power.{nl}
If you can prove that you are a Revelator, I will tell you about Leja.
Oh, that? I'm so sorry about that.{nl}It's not the first time it happened, now it seems they're finding other people to bother.{nl}
Just a moment.{nl}I'll give it to you right away.
When I was little the ferrets would help us get back to the village whenever we got lost.{nl}But now we've been fooled by the demons... It's a shame.
I made something based on the totem I built for that filthy demon.{nl}I made it so that it radiates good instead of evil energy.{nl}
It's still only in testing phase, but it'll be worth something.{nl}Place this near the ferrets and watch their reaction.
This is all our fault.{nl}We should have been more suspicious, but the name of Revelator got us hopeful.{nl}
I wish this statue could bring peace between us and the ferrets.
The ferrets are more violent?{nl}So I failed...?{nl}
I'm so sorry. Are you sure you're not hurt?{nl}Ah... But I'm not going to quit.{nl}
They're probably still brainwashed by the demons.{nl}We should ask Benes when he comes back from studying the ferrets in Zeraha.
Revelator, you're late!
Oh... I didn't know.{nl}I'm so sorry. I've talked to our village chief about it countless times but...
What?{nl}You mean the girl could have been sent by Goddess Laima?{nl}I saw her running away from the ferrets to the Broken Bridge!{nl}
I wanted to chase after them but...{nl}The ferrets were so many, there was nothing I could do.{nl}
We have no time to waste.{nl}We can still find the girl if we go after the ferrets now!
I should have gone after them...{nl}I'm so worried now. I hope she's okay...
Demon Lord Zaura took the girl?{nl}Oh no... Zaura is the one who had Goddess Lada taken away by demons in the past.
Be careful when you collect Drowsy Herbs. {nl}There's a reason why they call them that.
Oh, right.{nl}When Zaura took the girl, did you see any ferrets around?{nl}
That means the ferrets are keeping the girl.{nl}They know the forest well, you see.{nl}
I mean, I was born and raised here so I'm not clueless either.{nl}I think... I can guess where they're hiding her.{nl}
It's too dangerous to just go out to save her without a plan, though.{nl}Things could get ugly if they start attacking.{nl}
Right. I know a scent that makes ferrets lose their minds.{nl}Will you bring me some Drowsy Herbs so I can make some?
This should be enough to make the scent.{nl}Hold on a minute.
Don't worry if you accidentally get a whiff of the herbs.{nl}I made sure it only affects ferrets.
Here's the scent.{nl}Let's see now... About the ferrets...{nl}
There are a few ferret hideouts around the Balais Highway and the Zelbe Shelter.{nl}That's probably where they're keeping the girl.{nl}
When you find the girl, throw the scent pouch I gave you.{nl}When the ferrets react to it, take the girl and come back!{nl}
Here...
I hope my words can reach you...{nl}I am Laima, goddess of destiny and premonition.{nl}
Before Medzio Diena, the goddesses lost much of their power.{nl}Because of this, Goddess Lada, unable to resist, was taken away by Demon Lord Zaura.{nl}
Zaura is using the life force of Goddess Lada to create an evil contraption called Kruvina.{nl}The same Kruvina to which countless lives were sacrificed in Castlefield.{nl}
The evil energy of Kruvina can make objects grow.{nl}Depending on how it is used, it can enhance the power of the demons, too.{nl}
By the time I had a vision of this horrible future, it was too late to do anything.{nl}That's why... I sent a young girl to meet you.{nl}
Only one person can free this forest from the calamity that fell upon it...{nl}A savior among the Revelators. You.{nl}
Take this orb...{nl}Goddess Lada is being held captive at the Seir Rainforest. Please, rescue her and stop the demons' plans...
An outsider...? Hm, you'll have to do.{nl}Hey, um... will you give me a hand?{nl}
I'm trying to figure out why the ferrets are siding with the demons.{nl}So I found a way to turn into one and talk to them.{nl}
Thing is, they've seen me too many times already.{nl}Even when I turn into a ferret, they recognize my smell and start attacking me.{nl}
If that's okay with you, will you turn into a ferret and snoop around for me?{nl}
I'm going to make a transformation scroll from the information we collect.{nl}Write everything down. You can't act too awkward as a ferret.
Your observations are pretty detailed.{nl}You should be ready to transform now. Hold on.
Here you go.{nl}The transformation scroll is ready.{nl}
From your observations I don't think you'll be awkward at all.{nl}I trust that you'll be comfortable talking to the ferrets.{nl}
See if you can find out why the ferrets are siding with the demons.{nl}Don't forget to turn into a ferret first with the scroll.
If the scroll wears out in front of the ferrets they'll come at you, so be careful.
Hm? So what you're saying is...{nl}The ferrets are helping the demons on purpose?{nl}
How does...{nl}I can't believe it!
Did the ferrets really say that?{nl}I know you have no reason to lie, but still...{nl}
I really can't believe it, though.{nl}The ferrets have always been nothing but friendly.{nl}
I need to see if they at least still feel some compassion to humans.{nl}I'll try and enchant a piece of wood to look like someone injured.{nl}
The wood is going to look like someone who's hurt to whoever looks at it.{nl}Place it close to the ferrets and see if they attack.
Will they attack someone if they're injured? {nl}Nah... If they do, it's even more serious than I thought...
They really attacked the piece of wood?{nl}That's a bad sign. It means they're attacking anyone and everyone...
There's no doubt after this experiment.{nl}The ferrets are very, very dangerous now.{nl}
Still, there's no way I can fight all those ferrets.{nl}The most I can do is chase away the ones closest to the village.{nl}
There's a type of strong scent that ferrets hate.{nl}If we make a fire and burn this scent, that should keep the ferrets away.{nl}
Would you spread the scent around the Bellai Forest Workshop?{nl}It smells a bit... foul, but please do me this favor.
I should make more of the scent.{nl}In case the effect wears out.
Thanks.{nl}I don't think the ferrets are going to go near the workshop now.{nl}
It makes me mad to think the ferrets are using the scent thanks to the demons' dirty tricks.{nl}I should talk to Widas when I go back.{nl}
But I still think there has to be a way to make the ferrets go back to normal.{nl}R-right...?
You...{nl}You've finally saved me.{nl}
When Laima entrusted this forest to me...{nl}She said it would be consumed by a wave of calamity.{nl}
And, she said, after the wave has washed away, I would meet you.{nl}The one holding the light of salvation...{nl}
You are the one, the Revelator who will save our world...{nl}I have hope that it will be you now.
The reason behind the red water flowing in this forest and the contaminated crops...{nl}The plan to grow a giant bracken and spread the death spores...{nl}
All of that was possible because of the Kruvina.{nl}But their schemes didn't end there.{nl}
After the experiment yielded good results, the demons wanted to create a Kruvina that was even more powerful.{nl}
Their plan was to use not human lives...{nl}But mine. The life force of a goddess.{nl}
There cannot be a weapon like the Kruvina in our world.{nl}Only you can destroy the Kruvina and stop the demons' plans. {nl}
Demon Lord Zaura is gravely injured; now is your chance!
The Kruvina may be unfinished...{nl}But the fact that it uses my life force means it cannot be destroyed by human powers.{nl}
There is only one way...{nl}I need to impart my power on the orb Laima gave you...{nl}
Alas, most of my power was stolen from me during Medzio Diena, and what was left of it is with the Kruvina device.{nl}If only that power is released... I can use it to help you.
You did well.{nl}With the production stopped, the Kruvina cannot be completed.
Even an unfinished Kruvina is too dangerous for this world, however...{nl}It needs to be destroyed before the demons make use of it.{nl}
Whatever little power I have recovered, I will entrust it unto you.{nl}You have one chance... Please, destroy the Kruvina.
Before transforming into a ferret, you need to study their behavior.{nl}They're going to know something's up if you act weird.{nl}
I'm going to give you an empty scroll so you can take notes on the ferrets.{nl}After that you can transform.
Demon Lord Zaura will never stand for this.{nl}May you be blessed in the name of the goddesses.
The Kruvina... is in the hands of the demons.{nl}I'm glad you, savior, were able to return in safety.{nl}
Don't blame yourself.{nl}This is not your fault.
If you hadn't stopped the demons' plans, they would have completed the Kruvina.{nl}I believe Laima will be aware of this, too.{nl}
That feat alone was immensely important for us.{nl}No one can blame you...
Laima...{nl}How despairing it must have been for her, knowing she was powerless to change what would happen.{nl}
I imagine that's why she took it upon herself and drifted away.{nl}To find a solution for this calamity... she had no choice but to walk a lonely path.{nl}
Oh...!{nl}I just heard Laima's voice.{nl}She was calling out for you...{nl}
I think it's Laima's statue in Zeraha.{nl}You should go there.
Her voice was calling out for you, yearning.{nl}Hurry and go to the statue of Goddess Laima in Zeraha.
Laima...{nl}
She gave me a sad smile and walked away.{nl}She knew what would happen... And yet, she made a difficult choice...{nl}
Seeing you now, I can try to understand the reason behind her choice.{nl}The meaning of a savior... what she saw at the end of this catastrophe.{nl}
You said Laima asked you to find the revelations.{nl}The one closest from here will be in Fedimian.{nl}
I understand the weight of this task, but we must act now.{nl}It has to be you... No one but you can save Laima.{nl}
I will pass onto you the power of Laima's orb.{nl}Let it guide you to the revelation she has hidden.{nl}
Please, save Laima...{nl}Rescue her from the hands of Giltine...
You were brought here by destiny!{nl}Thank you, thank you for rescuing Goddess Lada.{nl}
Someday I'm going to rebuild a temple for Goddess Lada and Goddess Laima, when they return.{nl}
But the demons will not give up.{nl}And Lada's condition itself is still unstable.{nl}
We would like to chase away the demons left around here, would you help?{nl}
Goddess Lada is still not feeling well.{nl}We'll look after Her now.
Thank you.{nl}There are a lot less demons around now.
Now we need to purify the land contaminated by evil energy.{nl}But I don't know how.{nl}
This wasn't even the work of demons, but a human...{nl}Widas can't seem to find a solution right away, either.{nl}
Not far from here there's a big city called Fedimian.{nl}I wonder if there is a master there who could come up with something.{nl}
Of course I would go there myself but...{nl}We're short-handed as it is here, I don't think it would be right for me to leave.{nl}
If you can, I would like you to go to Fedimian and ask the masters there for advice.
So the land was contaminated not by demons, but a human...{nl}With the world as it is, who would have thought...?{nl}
I have a solution. I'm going to write you a purification scroll.{nl}That should be enough to solve the problem.
One of the masters in Fedimian should be able to help us!{nl}I hope so...
You're back already.{nl}Did... you find a master to help us?{nl}
The Druid Master wrote this scroll herself? {nl}That's even better than I expected. Thank you!
I found the source of the contamination.{nl}The demons set up another totem.{nl}
This purification scroll should do it but...{nl}With the demons guarding it, I can't get close enough to the totem.{nl}
Will you destroy the demon totem and purify it with the scroll?
I can't understand why someone would side with the demons...{nl}How powerful is their evil energy, that even ferrets can't handle it?
Revelator, your help has given us new hope. {nl}We couldn't have solved this without you...{nl}
After the new temple is completed, feel free to come by again, Revelator!
Our people feel safe now that everything's come to an end...{nl}You really are our savior. Thank you, thank you!{nl}
Our people are going to join forces and build a temple for the goddesses now.{nl}By the way, I was looking around the Irbedi Cliff for a spot to build the temple and I found a place with a strong vital force.
I couldn't do much more because of the demons...{nl}But the energy of that land, I'm sure it'll help Goddess Lada recover Hers.{nl}
So I want to ask you.{nl}They say this seed grows a flower that takes on whatever properties of the land where it's planted.
If we plant it on that land, the flower too will have the same life force.{nl}Will you bring that flower to Goddess Lada?
I have never felt a force so powerful.{nl}I only hope this flower can heal the wounds in Goddess Lada's body and spirit...
Even if it happened in accordance with Laima's prophecy, I have fallen and left the townspeople helpless and worried..{nl}My gratitude cannot be expressed through mere words...
And this flower is filled with great life force...{nl}My recovery won't take long with this. Again, thank you...{nl}
Thank you.{nl}May you be blessed by all the living beings in this forest...
If only I can escape the Redemption Ward... I can get my energy back.{nl}Please hurry...
The Kruvina is still being produced.{nl}You need to hurry...
Please lend me just a little more of your strength.{nl}Only you can do this.
A human sided with the demons...{nl}With the world as it is, who would have thought...?
I... feel my conscience fading away...{nl}Hurry and destroy the three devices... before the Kruvina is completed.{nl}
Fortunately, should I say... those devices were made by a human...{nl}Your abilities should be enough to destroy them.{nl}
The Redemption Ward first...{nl}Please, before I lose my senses...
You... destroyed the Redemption Ward.{nl}I'm fine. I'm just a little dizzy.
Now only the vitality absorption device and the suppressor are left.{nl}If you destroy the vitality absorption device, you'll stop the production of the Kruvina.{nl}
The device was made to absorb only the vitality of the goddesses...{nl}If it absorbs that of another being it will shut down.{nl}
Demon blood, especially, is opposite to my nature, and it will cause an ever stronger reaction on the device.
You really are Laima's chosen one...{nl}I feel like I'm regaining my energy a little now.
Finally, the Kruvina suppressor.{nl}That's the device that collects my vitality and supplies it to the Kruvina.{nl}
That much is operated by the demons' magic power alone.{nl}Use Laima's orb to overload the device.
Fedimian is a really big city.{nl}Especially because it's close to the Great Cathedral, it's a common destination for pilgrims.{nl}
Fedimian, too, was afected by Medzio Diena...{nl}But even though the business district was destroyed, a surprising number of people survived.{nl}
People there think it was because Fedimian is in the divine area where the the great statue of Goddess Austeja is.{nl}Now they're hard at work to rebuild the city.
Go down at the Kraijwi Crossings and you should see Fedimian.{nl}Alright then, I look forward to hear good news from you!
I'm very glad to hear that.{nl}The totems are close to the Inega Vacant Lot and in the Odur Backyard.
The girl disappeared with the light.
Elder Eloizard
You must quite talented, coming all the way over here.{nl}I'm the chief of a village downstream from this lake.
We came up here to try and find out why the lake turned red.{nl}I looked around for a while but as I was about to go back I got my path blocked by monsters.{nl}If that's all right, will you give me a hand?
Please.{nl}I just need you to clear out some monsters around here.
Samsonas
You're the traveler?{nl}I'm going to pray to the goddesses to make the lake clean again. {nl}Before the lake was contaminated I once saw people make offerings to an obelisk around here.

So you're the traveler who helped our chief. {nl}After the lake was contaminated there's more monsters around and we're afraid they'll hurt someone.{nl}Will you clear out some around here?
Hopefully we won't run into trouble before we go back to the village.
Thank you for your help.{nl}I hope we can all return safely.
The contaminated lake is a big problem.{nl}We really need to hurry and find a solution...
Lately there's a lot more monsters around, this area is dangerous now.
We came up all together but it's too dangerous here.
