According to rumors around Fedimian, when the pilgrims passed by the Pilgrim Path
According to the survivors, survivors of the Fallen City lost their belongings or their lives in the Altar Way while going to Fedimian.
Revelators are exploring the different fallen parts of the world to find assignments of the goddess. What seems to be a sanctuary was found in the Altar Way. If you can find something restore and use it again, you will be a hero to those who travel this area. 
According to the scout's reports, there were spell devices found in the Forest of Prayer. They tried to activate it but there were too many monsters around so they had to run for their lives. Someone has to activate the spell device and check what powers it has.

Lapemiter is a unique occupation that is highly respected, but is also looked down upon among Lapes. A Lapemiter serves a religious role, but the other Lapes don't put great emphasis on religious rituals, so they want a Lapemiter to do their exhausting duty.
Unlike the prejudice of the humans, Lapezards are not Lapes that obtained their current status through long training. Most of them are selected by their breeds and they grow up accordingly and receive the necessary food to become a Lapezard.
Their status is not high among Lapes, but they are most dangerous and they get encountered often. To receive respect from the other Lapes, they act violently to the ones they encounter with.
For a Lape to Lapflammer, they just need to obtain the weapons they need. But its not that easy since when Lapflammers die, the weapons also get destroyed so its not that easy for the Lapes.
Ferret Archers usually engages in battles, but they sometimes shoot down the fruits on tall trees. It's not that other ferrets asked them to do it, but they just do that for fun when they are not engaged in battles.
They sometimes move the objects, but they usually share the processed fruit products to other ferrets. It is unknown whether they receive any rewards for that or they are responsible to do so.
They look small, but they are matured ferrets. They sometimes become other ferrets depending on the properties of the breeds and the environment that they live in.
This ferret does not possess any distinct characteristic. But due to long labor, they possess strong power, so you should not underestimate it.
Ferret Empty Porter
They do work while supervising the works of other ferrets.
This ferret is responsible for looking for other enemies and useful fruits.
Like Ferret Archers, they either attack enemies or shoot down the fruits. One advantage they have over archers is that they sometimes use hard fruits as bullets.
Ferret Supply Soldier
This ferret has an inferior status compared to the other ferrets. This ferret helps with the works of other ferrets and they also participate in battles.
It is not assured that the Lapeman is the undead of a Lape. However, the Lapeman mostly receives respect from the other Lapes.

Almost Golem in the world originally crafted for good purposes, but now, They have been working caused by the evil spirit.
Ellaganos is created with the strong power and form, after the unique undead which mixed with the dead and stone used at the grave over many years.
There are famous comments by someone, this monster is hard to eat and to protect.
Mirtis is considered a low-ranked Demon Lord of all the others. The reason why is probably because she failed many missions that were given to her from Giltine. On her last mission, she was sealed by a human. Since Medzio Diena, she has now the freedom to catch up on her failed mission.
There are some Demon Lords who create a clone of their own or divide their own powers. This is one of those cases. In addition, the Sorcerer gain advantages by using similar magic that the demons use.
Molich achieved lots of success by served many Demon Lords over many years, and he has a chance to reach more higher rank lately. Scholars who know the demon history expected if that happened Molich will be pass the low rank Demon Lord like Bramble and Mirtis.

Each Woodspirit has various personalities. Unlike the outline color, there are various it such as solo play and demon's pawn. But, there are no Woodspirit which have a like to a human.

Medzio Diena and the Divine Tree

Using fire when defending castles is a normal tactic...{nl}But the amount of preparation here seems to be beyond ordinary.{nl}
This was enough to burn down the entire castle.{nl}What could it have been for?
From what you've uncovered... It seems like the teal colored magic circle must have been a top secret magic circle.{nl}If so... that means that this magic circle is...
It seems a bit strange that a mage that was in charge of maintaining the Castle Wall was so deeply involved in plant-related research.{nl}Perhaps they had other intentions?

There's nothing significant about the magic circles
There are still people that are maintaining the magic circles

They are meant to be in the corridors
The placement of the barrels is not important
The Magic Stone is durable seeing that it's still in working condition
It seems to be very sturdy seeing that it is still in working condition
It may have been to burn the castle should they lose the war
It may not have anything to do with Medzio Diena
They never intended on using oil in the first place
There may have been a reason they could not use it at the time
It could mean that the magic circle hasn't been used
It may have been a situation in which Oil Barrels were needed
All of the Wall's Devices haven't been used
Let's start from the beginning.{nl}First... the fact that the Impact Absorption Magic Circle is still here...
If so, why were the Oil Barrels taken out from storage?

Medzio Diena has been stopped

The plan succeeded, but wasn't enough to stop Medzio Diena
Goddess Laima is actually a demon
The Castle Walls were made to amplify the power of the Divine Tree
The fact that you feel evil energy here has nothing to do with it
The Core is the energy that holds the walls together
It is a horrid tool of war created by the greed of humans
I suppose so
Goddess Laima prophesized Medzio Diena
She wasn't able to to fulfill her role in stopping Medzio Diena
The demons made the Three-Layered Castle Walls obsolete
It was a last resort. In case they couldn't stop the Divine Tree
Let's try starting over, shall we?{nl}There was a reason for constructing the Three-Layered Castle Wall...
Goddess Laima accurately predicted Medzio Diena but was unable to stop it.{nl}The reason was...
Especially if the core on the Outer wall was crafted by Goddess Laima...{nl}There can only be on reason why you can sense evil energy there.
You said that the core had a strong enough magic residing in it to blow the surrounding area up.{nl}Why was such a dangerous thing placed there?{nl}There has to be a reason the demons defiled that core...

Protect the torch for 1 minutes to open the way

A spirit that became evil after coming into contact with something demonic. It is not a human spirit turned evil, but a spirit corrupted after fusing with a demonic one.
It became ever more difficult for Goddess Austeja to look over this task, and so this type of monsters started to appear.
Ellaganos are undead creatures that become fused with their gravestones and emerge after a long period of time possessing enormous power.
Some Demon Lords create their own forces or distribute their power to perform other tasks. This is one of such cases. Sorcerers are also known to profit from magic that uses the characteristics of these demons.
Molich has served several Demon Lords over the centuries and is likely to keep advancing into higher ranks. Experts who have studied demon history predict that, if he does, he could surpass even lower-rank Demon Lords such as Bramble or Mirtis.
Ghosts under the influence of demons can take various forms and appearances.
Demon Lord Bramble is considered the least ingenious. Gesti, who favors simpler personalities, however, granted him higher authority. Bramble is also believed to have nearly succeeded in seizing a goddess relic, a task where other Demon Lords have failed.
Medzio Diena brought about several forms of mutated monsters. Among them is the Golem, whose mutations, thus far unknown, could be either of magic or natural origin.
Unlike what it may seem, this monster lives only in highly specific environmental conditions.
This monster's eyesight isn't actually bad, despite what its name might suggest.
A subspecies of the Hanaming. Recently found and currently still in research.
The subordinate of Demon Lord Mirtis in charge of reconnaissance operations. Some believe him to be an alter ego.
Usually referred to as a monster that returned from the dead. In reality, it underwent death to be reborn as a demon.
As a monster of mineral-type mutation, it is unclear why it bears resemblance to a whale.
While most fairy or spirit-type creatures have sided not with humans and goddesses but with demons, the small minority that hasn't is currently taking a neutral stance. Genies are one type of such creatures.
Insect-type monsters mutated during Medzio Diena are known to have queens or other monarch entities.
For unknown reasons, after mutating during Medzio Diena this monster shows high hostility towards the goddesses.
Although it does not affect humans, this monster strongly dislikes other insect types besides itself, particularly bee-type monsters.
Powerful insect-type monsters tend to become either vicious hunters or influential individuals. The latter group, in which the Throneweaver is included, is particularly dangerous, as they often side with demons.
Humans have attempted to tame these monsters before they grow, but only demons have succeeded in doing so.
The most difficult aspect about dealing with these monsters is that they can appear in people's houses unexpectedly.
As a bird, it is easily attracted to bird feed. Demons use this to make these monsters attack humans.
It is unclear whether it was mutated during Medzio Diena or through a Demon Lord ritual. In any case, it was once a useful piece of equipment.
It is not known whether these monsters transformed after Medzio Diena and moved from the sea to the land as a result or if they are originally demonic beings. Goddess Jurate is not interested in them.
Shadowgaler was originally a spirit, but it embraced the power of the demons on Medzio Diena.
Rexipher is known as the wisest Demon Lord among all Demon Lords. The reason why he is not active as he should be is because the Demon Queen Gesti doesn't know how to use him effectively. That is good for humans.
He has the tendency to control evil spirits and steal the power from those who do not obey him in order to accumulate even greater power.
It may be easy to think of these monsters' mutated appearance on land, completely unrelated to any kind of sea creature, as the work of demons. In fact, this phenomenon cannot be explained that easily.
The theory that Linkrollers move by magical reaction has been proven. However, what's interesting is that this was not designed by anyone, it was simply created naturally around Medzio Diena.
Many people are participating on the efforts to prevent them from producing offspring by spurting out spores.
It was never observed before that a monster which was originally a bug turned into an imago type monster. It shouldn't occur when you look at it.
Nederbovine bases its origin on the demon realm. This is not an intelligent demon. It is a beast that is being raised by demons.
It is unknownn what type of animal this monster consumes in order to obtain its eyes.
A long time ago, he was the hidden guardian who used to protect graves from robbers.
Many monsters created lots of diverse transformations on Medzio Diena, but Carapace is unique among them. It was created from the shell which was molted from other animals.
Werewolves have been drifting diverse worlds from a long time ago. They don't belong to any world and they think Medzio Diena will be a good chance for them.
You shouldn't misunderstand a Woodin that doesn't move as a good stump.
It is not sure whether Worgs interact with human spirits or if they are a wolf species from ancient times.
Some people used to think these monsters received very little influence from Medzio Diena, when in fact they have developed to a great degree.
Kirmeleech sucks the blood of either monsters or demons since humans are too small for them. However, they do not attack humans, so it's actually not important whether they suck blood from humans or not.
Even the demons who caused Medzio Diena didn't know the Magburks around them would turn out like this.
Naktis has three sisters who are Demon Lords and they are all related to Demon Queen Gesti.
There's a rumor that the monster who Rexipher modified to break into the Royal Mausoleum is the starting point.
Although its name is similar, it is not related to the monsters that turned out from birds.
The Great King Zachariel destroyed the majority of his documents since he was worried about any intrusion. Therefore, we don't know if Tomb Maiden was created by humans.
This info might not be useful to you in real battles, but this monster is very weak against other demons.
This arrogant monster who betrayed the blessing of Goddess Zemyna is considered a shame to the goddesses.
The history of the Deathweaver has long been known to humans. Many are the warriors and mages who perished in their nets of death.
The most dramatic change the Goblin society experienced on Medzio Diena was the appearances of strong creatures like the Templeshooter. However, they prioritize their individual benefits more than the Goblin tribe. Even if they serve others, there's a certain possibility that they have hidden purposes.
Minotaurs have existed since a long time ago, and besides the fact that one other species with wings came from it, they remain as violent as they were in the past.
Legend has it that this is an object of an ancient devil whose identity is unknown. According to that legend, even Giltine didn't want to fight against it.
Before Medzio Diena, encounters humans rarely encountered Hydras, but when they did, the Hydras were an opponent difficult to face. They are no longer imortal, however, so anyone competent enough should be able to hunt one.
The demons are trying to give the Manticen great power so they can control other insect-type monsters.
The research to find out why some Kepas transformed like this is ongoing. There are also efforts to make them edible, but not many expect positive results.
The Divine Tree, which was the rest place for the goddesses, became their enemy.
The transformation of the Canceril is now considered ordinary, in a world full of monsters derived from all sorts of lifeforms.
This transformation is now considered ordinary, in a world full of monsters derived from all sorts of lifeforms.
The Glackuman, who dreams of becoming a famous fighter, is only satisfied if he is dispatched to locations where a lot of fights are taking place.
There's nothing special about Demon Lord Blut. But, what is significant about him is that he is the Demon Lord that was randomly picked by Giltine to disturb Laima's prediction.
Prior to Medzio Diena, this monster spent most of its time sleeping, so it wasn't that dangerous.

It is certain that they existed before Medzio Diena. However, it is strange that they were never discovered by humans in the 1,000 years of the kingdom's history. And when strange things occurred in the world after Medzio Diena, they appeared as a result of the influences and unfortunately they are against the humans. Those of this color are usually older than the rest.

You might think that the Ragbird doesn't look like much. You may want to think again taking in the fact that it's a demon.
Did they raise crops in the demonic world and were they affected by Medzio Diena? Nobody knows, but it is an interesting topic to think about.
It is impossible to tell if it is a real scarecrow or a monster. It might look similar because a demon might have imitated a human scarecrow. It might also be a mutation from the demonic world, but nobody knows for certain.
What passes for a cute puppy in the demonic world is a savage beast by human standards.
Rumpelstiltskin is the first demon who dealt with the Kedora Merchant Alliance, but Vhaldobas is the demon who dealt with them the most. Vhaldobas had a strong sense of curiosity for a demon and especially so for science and engineering. Vhaldobas did not mind trading with humans. Of course, this doesn't mean that any human can trade with demons. 
They are not high ranking demons. In fact, they even play the role of clowns in front of high ranking demons. However, demons will sometimes boast that they are simply close to stronger demons.

The Nightshadow Fox Wizard does not use many spells. They prefer to perfect a few spells to the extreme.
There must only be one Akhlass Princess per region. If not, they will battle until there is only one left standing. If there are more than one per region, this is a sure sign of there being an even higher ranking demon controlling them. 
The lifespan of a Castle Princess is rarely more than one hundred years. This is unusually short for a demon. As such, they try every method of extending this short lifespan including magic, vampirism, alchemy and much more.
It's nickname is the one who was swallowed first. According to rumors, it has gained it's current appearance after being swallowed by Gesti and being reincarnated. It is unknown if Diena is actually loyal to Gesti despite following her orders. If Giltine did actually warn Gesti against giving power to Diena, then it might mean that Diena still has a hatred of them. Her name comes from when she was swallowed, during the day.
This monster is said to move without taking the rider's will into consideration.
The Kugheri believe that the world changes based on three different reasons, and how it looks depends on which reason is the strongest. The Kugheri Balzermancer is the leading Kugheri of this faith and is more of a shaman than a priest.
Solcomm
Solcomm is a Demon Lord that was quite skilled but had the misfortune of meeting a bad leader, a skilled opponent such as Lydia Schaffen, fighting in unfavorable terrain, having bad minions and choosing the wrong allies. In other words, Solcomm was the unluckiest Demon Lord. 
Demon God Baubas has great ambitions on taking over the realm of the Goddess'. Trampler is a loyal minion of Baubas and there are many rumors saying that Trampler will become a Demon Lord soon.
Meska Lord
Lunger Boar
Fealty Hound
Amiss Dog
Quip Mage
Madon Maiden
Prodded Horse
Tel Harsha
Prodigious Kugheri Balzermancer
Aphisher
Only after painful research was it found that this monster had mutated from an animal. While nobody now believes that it is from a plant, it is still being debated on what type of animal it was.
Gob
These monsters, which are mutated seaweed, attack all they can see and will follow them if they are stronger. However, it is difficult for land-faring humans or monsters to lead them since they will run into the sea when cornered.
Nimrah Damsel
A female Nimrah. After their mutation, Nimrah males focused only on battle and started to neglect their eggs. This is no different for the Damsel. Oceanographers and other researchers are studying their changed habits, but have yet to find anything solid.
Varlefloater
The Varlefloater is known to trade with humans in extremely rare circumstances. They can tell if the human is reliable enough to trade with but usually deem them unworthy. It is unknown what criteria the Varlefloater uses to analyze their opponents.
Nimrah Lancer
Even the species that had been under Goddess Jurate's influence went their separate ways after mutating into monsters. The Nimrah either started working for the demons or stayed under Jurate's influence on individual levels.
Nimrah Soldier
After Medzio Diena, some Nimrah have ambitions of ruling both the sea and land. They will cooperate with demons and even defy what Goddess Jurate is saying in order to achieve this goal.
Varle Gunner
If you are pressed into finding a human society equivalent, the closest thing would be an independent mercenary. Of course, this doesn't mean that the Gunner has no loyalties. Varle social tendencies are difficult for a normal person to understand.
Varle Hench
The Varle will fight other Varle if not from the same group. The Varle Hench is usually in charge of pioneering and scouting and is normally the first to fall.
Varle Skipper
After Medzio Diena, oceanic creatures chose one of three paths whether they had mutated or not. They could still follow Goddess Jurate, cooperate with the demons, or act independently. While the Varle are independent, they had always had a certain dislike for humans making many think that they are cooperating with demons. Varle Skippers are among the leading elite of the Varle society.
Varle Henchmen
Despite what they may look and act like, Varle Henchmen are even more important than Varle Skippers. That is because the influence of Varle Skippers are measured in how many Varle Henchmen are following them. As such, a Varle Skipper without any Varle Henchmen is nothing more than an empty flag.
Varle Anchor
Varle Anchors are usually older Varle, which might seem surprising. Of course, there are younger Varle as well, but this is because they are well experienced. While Anchors will also participate in battle, they are used to show their dominance over a certain area.
Varle Helmsman
According to Varle societal rules, the Skipper has seniority over the Helmsman. However, the Helmsman can beat the Skipper to a pulp if the Henchmen support him and choose to lead the group in a different direction. This doesn't mean that the defeated Skipper is exiled. Only Goddess Jurate might understand this madness.
Kindron Weilder
Unlike most other mutated sea creatures, the Kindron were always distant with Goddess Jurate. They used to be the scavengers of the ocean before they mutated during Medzio Diena. There are some that still remain loyal to Goddess Jurate, but most have become hostile towards her.
Kindron Reilter
Used to be a creature that purified water before Medzio Diena. There are currently many that care not for their pasts and have started to leave Goddess Jurate's influence.
Lavisher Mage
This evil demon will do all that it can to torment those weaker than itself even if they are demons. They will even perform mind-control on weaker demons, but the high ranking demons do not seem to care. They wreak havoc when they appear in our world.
Lavisher
Lavishers are all evil, but how they torment their prey depends on an individual level. This particular specimen loves to torment it's prey without saying anything until the prey manages to understand what the Lavisher wants. 
Lake Golem
A magical levitation stone from the Starlit Lake that turned into a monster during Medzio Diena. It was thought to only exist near Starlit Lake since most of the magical levitation stones throughout human history were used there, but it seems as if the Kedora Merchant Alliance and Agailla Flurry had quite a few of their own. 
Fondus
Fondus were known to occasionally appear near Starlit Lake even before Medzio Diena. There was a massive increase in their population after Medzio Diena. The liquid on top of the Fondus is an extremely rare foodstuff. It costs a fortune to detoxicate it enough to be fit for human consumption. It may be put back on the tables of nobles if the Schaffen Star manages to recover.
Anchor Golem
The Anchor Golem is a monster that is derived from the linkage in the magical levitation stone. 
Lily Velly
The Lily Velly has the ability to levitate which means it can appear anywhere. However, it likes magical levitation stones and magic-infused water which makes Starlit Lake it's preferred habitat. Its numbers were kept under control when Schaffen Star was active, but those days are far gone.
Jelly Velly
The Jelly Velly is dangerous even when it is deactivated. It is said that it can affect the mental state of people that have it close by for too long. 
Atti
You can see a strong hatred resonating from the otherwise cute Atti. While misfortune is not uncommon post Medzio Diena, it is sad that even vegetation and their fruits are attacking humans.
Litchiring
The vegetation in the Great Woodlands was not tropical. There was no change in climate after Medzio Diena either. As such, it is a mystery as to why there are so many plant-type monsters in that region. The same can be said to why the Litchiring is found amongst the White Tree Forest.
Yakyak
According to legend, the Yak are demons that are looking for a king to succeed the fallen king that they had been contractually bound to. However, the Yak are having a difficult time finding their place in the demonic world as there are no humans that wish to deal with demons in order to rise to the throne.
Yak Shaman
Black Hohen Barkle
A specimen that is in the process of going through a rite of passage in the Hohen society. Those that have already proven much have black fur.
Black Hohen Ritter
The Hohen Ritter is the backbone of Hohen society regardless of the color of their fur. Although there are times where the Hohen Mane and Mages command them, they have a certain pride that they are the pillars of Hohen society. Remembering that those with black fur have plenty of experience from the demonic world is important.
Yak Warrior
Yak Druid
Bush Beetle
There is a theory about monsters derived from insects after Medzio Diena. Scholars think that insects that mutated under the influence of magic will mutate into only having two eyes instead of the original insectoid eyes. It is believed that the Bush Beetle is such a case, but nobody has managed to get proper evidence to back this theory.
Blossom Beetle
While unconfirmed, it is thought that the Blossom Beetle is a form of insectoid undead. If so, the flower on it's back is growing on a carcass.
Black Hohen Gulak
Black Hohen Mane
Yak Mambo
Yakmap
Neuk
If you find yourself staring at glaring red eyes in an abandoned building or in a dark forest, it will most likely be a Neuk. Prepare to fight.
Beur
Started appearing in devastated rural areas but has started spreading since. Thankfully, it does not have high intelligence so it is unlikely to be able to spread too much.
Black Hohen Mage
Hohen Mages are rather new in Hohen society. Demons that had lived in our world rather than the demonic world. Those that had great magical talents grew in number after Medzio Diena and became Hohen Mages. Some Hohen were more active in the demonic world. These specimen are usually black.
Mangosting
The Great Woodlands are heavily wooded as you might expect. While the concerns of people about the area becoming a home to droves of plant-type monsters has not come to pass, there are still many fruit type monsters that do not appear to be natural. the Mangosting is one such monster.
Half Mangosting
Despite the fact that it has already been 4 years since Medzio Diena, there are still some people trying to eat monsters that look similar to fruits even if they don't taste good enough to die for. Please don't risk your life to make a Half Mangosting, it isn't worth it.
Drooper
Droopers occasionally feel strong impulses to murder humans and as such are basically serial killers. They are dangerous because nobody has any knowledge on when they feel such impulses.
Red Stone Orca
Stone Orca are a peculiar case even among the monsters to appear after Medzio Deina. They appear as sea-faring creatures that don't have any relation to minerals and appear in areas that are far from the oceans. Nobody has yet solved the mystery behind these monsters. The reason this particular Stone Orca is red is because of the oxidized steel.
Black Hohen Orben
Hohen competed against humans since the birth of the kingdom. They were cooperative to demons instead of the goddesses, but they posed no big problems since their amount was small compared to humans. However, the environment that Medzio Diena changed is working more advantageous for Hohens instead of humans so it is not certain whether humans would have an edge over them in the future. Hohen that were more active in the demonic world are black.
Black Harugal
The fact that the Harugal, mavericks of the demonic world are still holding on can be traced back to two reasons. One is the fact that demons don't track down outsiders if they aren't ordered to. The other is because Harugal are quite strong and ferocious. Those that have been in a lot of conflicts in the demonic world have black fur. 
Oscuro
The Oscuro are born high above the demonic world and grow heavier the longer they live. They start living closer to the ground as they do so because the growth rate of their wings is too slow to sustain their flight. They basically crawl on the ground just before they die. While females might be able to temporarily fly higher after they spread their offspring, male Oscuro will never be able to fly as high as they did the day before.  
Claro
Souls and consciousness are prey of the Claro. Whether in our world or the demonic world, those preyed on by the Claro may appear to be fine but will die quickly due to the lack of soul and consciousness. They will feast on larger prey together. Humans will not be able to return to the Goddess' if they are preyed on by Claro when they die.
Bookmark Mimic
Wherever this monster appears in the world, the fact that it comes from Goddess Vaivora's Fantasy Library is undeniable. However, humans know little about the Fantasy Library and as such little is known about this monster.
Page Mimic
Similar to a Bookmark Mimic. Wherever this monster appears in the world, the fact that it comes from Goddess Vaivora's Fantasy Library is undeniable. However, humans know little about the Fantasy Library and as such little is known about this monster.
Archless Angel
Demons do not deal well with hardship and pain. Of course, there are always exceptions to the rule and there are certain demons that rise above the rest after enduring hardship. The fascinating thing is that the Archless Angel is not such a demon. It is merely the byproduct of chaos.
Luna Angel
The Luna Angel is born during the process of the Archless Angel becoming stronger. Most of the chaos from the Archless Angel is given to the Luna Angel during this process. They become entirely separate entities after this and live their individual lives.
Levada
Never before seen monsters have started appearing in the Fantasy Library after Giltine's infiltration. The Levada is one such monster and the Kupoles are worried that the Levada will spread to the rest of the world.
Martybook
The Martybook is also a monster that appeared after Giltine's infiltration. It is said that you might be able to catch a ride on top of it if you are lucky enough.
Crowvasia
Crowvasia all have different personalities which means that the only thing the Crowvasia have in common is the fact that they have nothing in common. They are known to follow Hauberk, and this is thought to be because at least one of Hauberk's diverse personalities suit the Crowvasia. There are of course just as many that hate Hauberk for the same reasons. It is difficult for even high ranking demons to utilize Crowvasia on a large scale if they aren't Giltine. It is rumored that Giltine has in fact mobilized many of them recently.
Rotascion
Most demons prefer chaos over order. Rotascion are one of the most extreme. Only the strongest demons will be able to bend them to their will.  
Boogey Box
They are not animals nor inanimate objects. They are demons and yet they are not demons. They have souls yet they do not have souls. They are born when chaotic demons such as the Crowvasia or Rotascion hide their souls to objects after defying stronger demons and failing. Of course, they show peculiar traits due to their chaotic souls. As such, it is better to see them as inanimate objects turned into monsters rather than the souls of demons.
Cretobien
The Cretobien is a demon that was unknown to humans before Medzio Diena. As such, it is speculated that this demon might actually dislike being in our world.
Creto
Humans don't know what the Creto do in the demonic world. Some say that they might provide entertainment to higher demons based on their appearance, but this is most likely an error in judgment because demons don't have the same emotions as humans.
Varle King
The Varle King is the most revered among all Varle. Many Varle King are cooperating with Demon King Kartas in order to widen their realms. Those from the Zealot Order dislike all that have betrayed Goddess Jurate and they especially dislike the Varle Kings.
Nimrah Duke
The Nimrah Duke are usually leaders of a group. If there are more than one Nimrah Duke in a group, they form an oligarchy in order lead the group.
Nimrah Frieker
When the Nimrah Frieker's are not engaged in battle, they mostly hunt. The spoils of the hunt are distributed along the Nimrah hierarchy, so it can be said that they provide food for the whole Nimrah society.
Angry Tutu
Demon Lord Warpulis
Warpulis is one that gets along nicely with Demon King Kartas as they both have fickle personalities. It seems as if Chaos itself has worked itself into this being as Warpulis is ready to sneer at it's opponents while brutally attacking them. As such, no other Demon Lord is interested in keeping Warpulis as a minion. Only Demon King Kartas seems to be able to handle Warpulis.

Christmas Tree Pop-up Book
Christmas Santa Pop-up Book
Meska Lords are constantly evolving. After living as normal bears, during Medzio Diena they gained special intelligence and strength, becoming powerful monsters that attack other creatures for their energy. 
Lunger Boars appeared after Medzio Diena and they are thought to be manmade monsters. It is the only possible explanation for the strange attachments on their backs.
Fealty Hound aren't demons, but beasts originating from our world that evolved into monsters. It is assumed they were created not by Giltine, but by another demon goddess. The Fealty Hounds are therefore loyal to demon goddesses.
Amiss Dogs are monsters created artificially during Medzio Diena. Apparently, however, their creator is not satisfied with the results due to unexpected consequences. 
Quip Mages aren't animals; they are assumed to be cursed humans or failed transmutation experiments.
Medzio Diena was a fortunate event for Madon Maidens, as they managed to possess different creatures in order to become more powerful. However, it is still uncertain whether their possessing spirit is human or demon.
Prodded Horses are a species of unicorn born after Medzio Diena that mutated into a monster.
Tel Harshas are one of the many forms a human can take when they are reborn as a demon. It may not be the best form, but the fact they became Tel Harshas means they were once highly respected humans.

Bloms and Virdneys became monsters through the same process. The only difference is that Virdneys sprouted from the ground.
Velcoffer
Velcoffer Guards aren't demons, but regular animals that mutated into monsters. What's more, the advent of these beasts wasn't caused by Medzio Diena. The Sage Master speculates that they were one of the monster species said to have been exiled from our world in a joint effort by goddesses and demons. As there are no records of these monsters prior to Medzio Diena, it's possible that the disaster set them free from the seals that detained them.
Tainted Gargoyle
As Demon Lord Baiga gradually takes on Gesti's legacy, the demons that protected his territory have been appearing more frequently in our world. One example of that is the Tainted Gargoyle.
Cave Minivern
Cave Miniverns are the scavengers of the demon world. They can feed on carcasses, but they tend to hunt other small necrophagous animals. These monsters aren't built to live underground, but they are often spotted in sewers or caves, where they go to hunt.
Velcoffaner
Better known as subordinates of Demon King Kartas. Although some monsters tend to change masters with ease, this species is said to dutifully obey every whim of their commandant.
Cave Minivern Warrior
Cave Miniverns are less prone to following orders, preferring to listen to their instinctive needs. Therefore, this species was modified by high-rank demons to play a more specific role in combat. It is slightly stronger and more intelligent than other Miniverns.
Cave Minivern Mage
Some Cave Minivern Warriors have the ability to draw out magic from their bodies through the process of awakening. These monsters are an example of that.

[Event] Secret of the Stone Plates
It is not uncommon for inanimate objects to become monsters after Medzio Diena, but the appearance of candlesticks on the heads of existing monsters remains a curious phenomenon. 
According to a courageous observer, the two heads often quarrel with each other. If it weren't for their anatomy preventing either head from hurting the other, murder-suicides would likely be a common occurrence.
A monster born on Medzio Diena. After discovering these monsters, the demons trained them to pull carriages, and sent those with good combat abilities to the human realm.
Velnippers are the strongest of all Insect type monsters. They aren't invincible, but their chances of defeating other Insect monsters are high due to the venom they produce, which is particularly lethal to insects. 
This insect predator evolved to grow into a larger body, meaning it must now hunt and consume prey in large quantities to survive. That is, in fact, the reason why this species is not as abundant as others. 
For centuries Demon Lord Solcomm has attempted to attack the Astral Tower and Pbeta traveled between the demon realm and our world to aid him. But deep down, Pbeta was dissatisfied and his resentment against Solcomm grew. One day, Pbeta was unable to bear with Solcomm any longer and decided to revolt against him.  
Although the Schaffenstar will likely continue to exist, Ignas was the last head of the organization to be entrusted with a Revelation. He not only secretly murdered his predecessor but also manipulated the Demon Lord Solcomm and Pbeta to his own advantage and appropriated the power of a demon monarch. Despite his heinous actions, he was a man of exceptional talent, perhaps even comparable to the founder of the Schaffenstar, Lydia Schaffen.
Kabad was bound in a powerful contract after losing a battle. It is said that, after the term of the contract is complete, Kabad's eyes will be returned to it.
Even after transforming, this monster is known to have retained its ferocious nature. In fact, it is more vicious than many wild animals prior to the advent of domestication.
Wyvern
Its name may be similar to the Mallet Wyvern's, but they are two entirely distinct species.
Chess Special Popup Book
Lavenzard
Teal Specter
Although Teal Specter is dead, Medzio Diena has allowed his spirit to remain. Due to the strong magic he possessed in life, his spirit has a different composition from that of other specters.
Lotuscat
Monster born of the combination of magic stones and lake plants. Before Medzio Diena, they were spotted once every ten years on average. Now, they have increased in number and their population has become more difficult to control.  
Pate
Pates are known to appear in lakes when the quality of the water is low. These monsters existed prior to Medzio Diena.
Coterie
Coteries live in groups across all kinds of aquatic habitats, from ocean trenches to continental freshwater bodies.
Lilly Maid
Lilly Maids existed prior to Medzio Diena. Before the Schaffenstar began producing chemical baits for them, they were known to lure and drown local lake dwellers.
Spinacho
These monsters were once curbstones in the demon world that came to life when Demon Lord Solcomm enchanted them to become part of his troops.
Rubeta
Rubetas are an extremely prolific species. Despite being the most commonly hunted monster in the heydays of the Schaffenstar, they continue to prosper after Medzio Diena.
Little Rubeta
Little Rubetas can be frequently spotted after Medzio Diena. They did exist prior to that, but Rubetas develop quickly enough that it was rare to come across an infant. Nowadays, their growing numbers have made young Rubetas more common than ever.
Noli Maid
Long ago, it was thought that Noli Maids buried the lower half of their bodies under rocks to camouflage as flowers. Now we know that their roots gain mobility as the Maids turns into adults.
Beissen
Curiously, some Kindron have been known to live in fresh water after Medzio Diena. They are found not only in estuaries but far from the sea in continental lakes as well.
Mutt
Before Ignas took control of the Astral Tower, the water of the Starlit Lake was lethal to demons. To solve this, Demon Lord Solcomm created the Mutts and commanded them to construct a passageway through the lake.
Naste
Nastes are the materialization of Astral Tower Schaffenstar members transformed under the influence of the demons. Ignas controls their minds, forcing them to obey him.
Gleam Lens
Like Mad Lenses, Gleam Lens monsters were once magic lenses left behind by Lydia Schaffen that transformed under the effects of Medzio Diena.
Rabbler
Rabblers and Punters are closely related creatures that serve in the demon world as both livestock and hunting companions. 
Wryer
Rumors tell that Wryers were once used as companions by Schaffenstar hunters before they became too ferocious and turned into monsters.
Nasleia
Nasleias are former Schaffenstar members that were transformed by magic to serve Ignas. It is said that they have no recollection of their lives as humans.
Mad Lens
Like Gleam Lenses, Mad Lens monsters were once magic lenses left behind by Lydia Schaffen that transformed under the effects of Medzio Diena.
Grob
Grobs are thought to have been used by Ignas in his battles against the Resistance army, or by Solcomm in his attacks against the Schaffenstar. In either case, we know these monsters were introduced to the lake for combat purposes.
Hafter
Some believe that Hafters may have once been the handles of telescopes placed around the Astral Tower. Conducting research at the Schaffenstar is impossible, however, so this hypothesis has never been confirmed.
Waglog
One could wonder where all these wooden barrels could have come from to transform into monsters, but the truth is that they are a common object found in any human assemblage.
Glove Golem
The Astral Tower is independently governed by the Schaffenstar, so research on the monsters that inhabit it is scarce. Because of this, we do not know whether Glove Golems appeared due to Medzio Diena or if Ignas created them voluntarily.
Punter
These monsters were brought into the Astral Tower after Ignas joined sides with the demons. They are said to inhabit extreme locations in the demon realm.
Moltooth
These creatures turned into monsters and began walking upright after Medzio Diena. Unable to return to their underground habitats, they began to hunt on the surface.
Bishop Star
Besides the fact that they originate from the demon realm, little is known about Bishopstars. Perhaps more will be revealed when future humans explore the demon world.
Wajak Walker
These monsters were pieces of furniture from the Fallen City that came to life after Medzio Diena. Many are the wooden objects that became monsters after that tragic day.
Horong Walker
Horong Walkers were born of a strange mutation involving will-o'-the-wisps.
Bishop Gray
Bishop Grays are said to be the clerics of the demon world, serving the Demon Goddess Ragana.
Bishop Point
Bishop Points are under the command of demon-world clerics who serve the Demon Goddess Ragana. Although she is only a minor figure in the demon realm, Ragana doesn't seem to cherish them as her followers.
Kigle
Kigles are monsters transformed from small-scale secret weapons of the Royal Army.
Kigle Lops
Kigles are monsters transformed from secret weapons of the Royal Army, after their magic began to react to the events of Medzio Diena. After that, General Lhamin halted the production of the weapons, and nowadays they are longer found in the Royal Army.
Bishop Blanco
Bishop Blancos are said to perform the role of altar servers to Demon Goddess Ragana. That is only an analogy, of course, as there is no direct equivalent in the human world.
Bishop Hart
Bishop Harts are demon-world clerics under the command of demon religious orders who serve Demon Goddess Ragana.
Poncer
Poncers are at the top of the food chain in their habitat. They can easily take down a human soldier and, despite their power, they are known to attack only in large groups, making them virtually invincible. Their small stature, however, means that they can become targets to other strong creatures when they are alone.  
Yishoneer
Species in the Yishon family were once nocturnal animals that lived in groups, until Medzio Diena turned them into monsters.
Yishon Torcher
Species in the Yishon family were once nocturnal animals that lived in groups, until Medzio Diena turned them into monsters. Some became active during the daytime and lost their eyesight, but at the same time they learned to use simple tools.
Cave Stonacorn
Cave Stonacorns originated from plant seeds mixed in the excrements of bats and other creatures.
Solcomm Summon
Kindron Leader
Kindron Leaders are called that because they tend to stand at the front in battles. Unlike their moniker, however, their position is rather low in the Kindron hierarchy.
Kindron Boor
All Kindron species that adapted to freshwater habitats eventually separated from Goddess Jurate. At sea, there are still Kindrons who follow the goddess, although they constitute a minority.
Humming Duke
Most people believe Humming Dukes to be a gruesome hybrid species that combines mosquitoes and insects created after Medzio Diena.
Night Panto Mage
These monsters were responsible for leading the negotiations of the Night Panto agreement. We know for sure that Night Pantos entered the Astral Tower after the agreement, although it is still uncertain how they arrived in the Fallen City. The contents of that agreement also remain unknown.
Pipi
In his efforts to annihilate the Resistance, Ignas acquired the Pipis before Medzio Diena and hatched them to serve in his own army.
Vespera
Well-grown Piangs become Vesperas. According to rumors, they once helped Ignas gain the upper hand in a battle against the Resistance.
Beetlegreen
These monsters settled in the Kingdom's capital after it became a site of ruins. Because of that, they suffered little influence from Medzio Diena and have maintained most of their original form.
Bumblegreen
Besides the larger body, Bumblegreens have remained mostly unchanged since Medzio Diena. That said, they have become incredibly adaptable to new environments.
Night Panto Archer
It is said that Night Panto Archers are set to receive access to the archery secrets in the Astral Tower after the end of their contract. Alas, that which they covet the most will never be theirs.
Nastudeu
Ignas created the Nastudeu by cursing members of the Schaffenstar with his own blood and transforming them. Unlike Nastes and Nasleias, however, theoretically it should be impossible to return the Nastudeu to their original form.
Night Panto Stellar
An unknown agreement of cooperation with the demons is known to have given special powers to a large number of Pantos, which have since changed into a new appearance. Although the other party in the agreement is not a demon, they are suspected to work in conjunction with them. 
Piang
Pipis who hatch become Piangs. Their stages of development are said to apply differently in the demon realm.
Mushuta
Mushutas transformed from mushrooms grown in cold regions. In northern provinces of the Kingdom, local sayings warn against mushrooms grown under the aurora. Many believe these monsters appeared at the Starlit Lake due to its starlight-attracting properties.
Trippy
Most small Insect types exist in large numbers. Trippies are an exception, as their populations are smaller than those of similarly-sized species.
Ice Tree
A tree of ice.
Froster Lord Reflection
Vine Walker
In the past, Nicopolis wizards grew these magic creatures by winding the springs on their backs to generate vines, which they used for gardening. After the accident of Nicopolis, however, they were affected by Medzio Diena and became the monsters they are today.
Crescent Moya
A few monster experiments created by the wizards of old Nicopolis have begun to reappear after Medzio Diena. Considering how commonly Moyas are used in experiments, Crescent Moyas are likely one of the species' many varieties.
Wiza Moya
Before their mysterious disappearance, the wizards of Nicopolis were known to conduct various experiments on monsters. One of those monsters was the species we now call Wiza Moya.
Slime Witch
Most of these monsters are old residents of Nicopolis who turned into slime. After a tragic experiment caused them all to disappear, Medzio Diena caused many to return to our world in the form of slime.
Kindron Shooter
Vesperia
Vesperias are the last stage of development of their species. These monsters could have caused serious damage to the Resistance army, if it weren't for the Masters' timely support.
Mimorat Purple
For generations, the wizards of Nicopolis experimented with all sorts of magic creatures. Mimorats were the products of their first experiments on common rats.
Mimorat White
Mimorat Whites were created to carry goods on their backs. Even after the wizards of Nicopolis disappeared, these Mimorats survived and have since developed tastes of their own.
Mimorat Pink
Mimorat Pinks have evolved from Mimorat Whites according to the tastes of the species. Pinks like to collect and carry all sorts of objects, with some objects becoming more popular than others in light of the latest trends.
Mimorat Green
Greens suffered the most radical transformations out of all the Mimorats after Medzio Diena. There is no telling why some were more affected than others, especially considering that all Mimorats belong to the same species.
Haunted House
These creatures were created as prisons according to the tastes of Nicopolis wizards. They became abandoned after the great accident, then turned into the monsters they are today with the influence of Medzio Diena.
Slime Wizard
These Nicopolis wizards who disappeared after the great accident and returned to our world as slime also lost their arms in the process, so they created a pair of slime arms that move by telekinesis. After that, they continued to conduct experiments and managed to cause another major accident.
Popup Cat
These creatures originate from a failed experiment of a Nicopolis wizard who attempted to produce easy-to-read magic books. A cute mistake in the history of the city.
Slime Gemini
Slime Gemini are the product of a failed experiment by Nicopolis wizards who returned to our world as slime and attempted to regain their human form by cloning themselves. Most residents of Nicopolis who were lost in the great accident and reappeared after Medzio Diena aren't very pleasant to look at.
Pervading Queen
She was one of the three wizards who ruled Nicopolis. After eliminating the capital and the court with a magic that affects only living beings, her ambitious experiments failed and caused the disappearance of all the residents of Nicopolis. She remained dormant in the form of dead matter, until the events of Medzio Diena brought her back to life.

Please, Kartas. My request is simple. Give me the power to defeat the Revelator and those who are after me.
If I can defeat them all... The power of Ziburynas will be yours, as promised.
You ruined all my plans! You'll regret this. I will make you suffer for all eternity!

Trap activated. You've been hit by arrows!
We came this far already. We cannot lose.
Is everyone else okay? I'm worried...
Great Lydia Schaffen, please guide our way.
Finally... a battle...{nl}Uuugh, my stomach...
Finally, time for some action.{nl}Let's go!
I wish all the members that are outside right now would return to the Tower. We're doing this to take back the Schaffenstar, after all.
Like that Dragoon family. Do you know them? They left after a disagreement with the old leader, so that won't be easy.
This battle is serious.{nl}Stay on your toes!
Phew, I should've been a pilgrim...
Don't say that, we're making history here.
I never went myself, but you don't think they'll send me to do a pilgrimage after this, do you?
You. Shut up and focus.
Well, the pilgrimage I went on with Commander Byle is nothing next to this.
Wow, a pilgrimage with Mr. Byle... Jealous...
Uugh... I don't want to die...
I feel sick...
I can't get up...
I'm so dizzy. I'm gonna throw up...
It felt so strange fighting those demons. Does that mean...
If those were my own comrades I was fighting...
... Blood was going to be shed either way. I'm ready for anything.
N-no! I don't want to be a demon!
I guess I'll never return to my family now...
Why did it have to end like this... 
It's all over now... There is no hope...
It could be worse... I could be dead.
You came. Commander Byle is over there.
I'm on the lookout for potential demon attacks.
Not that I think of it, it would be really helpful to have the Himil family on our side.
Rumors say that something has happened in the family that's keeping them busy.
If only Mechen hadn't made any mistakes, things wouldn't be so serious.
It's all in the past now. I wonder what Mechen is up to nowadays?
I'm monitoring the area, looking out for the enemy.
The story of how Lydia Schaffen defeated Ziburynas at the forest is a very famous one.
Ziburynas Forest has that name because that's where Ziburynas was defeated.
Ignas is incredibly powerful now... I wonder if maybe he has the Essence of Ziburynas?
We came all the way here, now all that's left is taking back the tower!
For the forgotten glory of the Schaffenstar!
Don't move! You'll get hurt.
Those demons... I didn't know they would be this strong.
Aaaaaah! Help!! It hurts!! 
The demons are way too powerful, we can't beat them...
Our members took great damage. We can't carry on like this...
The demons might try to attack here, so I'm keeping watch.
At least we have enough supplies on 21F...
We're running a little short on arrows...

Revelator. Thank you. Several Class Masters now have agreed to support us!
I was extremely surprised when General Lhamin said he would join himself... I'm so glad!
Hm, now that the Masters are helping us, we're well stocked up!
All the new arrows and food rations we've received, it's all thanks to you.
Don't get too comfortable. They may have retreated, but the enemy is still around. 
Well, the tower's ours. We can relax now.
We have restored the glory of the Great Lydia Schaffen.
Yes! The tower's ours!{nl}Uugh. My stomach is wrecked from the nerves...
Haha! I knew we could do it!
It was a tough battle...
Don't be too sure yet, there are still demons around.
Don't get too smug. Just because we got Ignas, doesn't mean it's over.
We're done! Ah. I can finally go back to my family.
Idiot. Their troops are still running around.
I'm glad it's over, but do I get to go on a pilgrimage now?
Come to think about it, what happens to old man Henika now?
We're supposed to be watching him for now.
Well... I'm sure Commander Byle will have something to say when he gets here.
Thank you... I can finally put my mind at ease...
Come to think of it, I wonder how Adaux and his group made it back?
I hope I never have to see my own colleagues suffer like that anymore.
I will remember our efforts today for as long as I live.
The noble sacrifices of our allies will not be in vain.
I'm relieved that the tower is ours again, but my heart aches for those who had to be sacrificed...
The Astral Tower is ours, we did it... but why can't I help these tears...
Thank you! You are the reason the Astral Tower is with us again!
It's a new beginning. For one, we will need to restore the tower.
Now that we have the tower back, we're gonna need a new leader... Do you think the Himil family would give it a thought?
Nah, they're pretty set on the whole Dragoon business. No way they would consider it.
We've done it. Today we made history.
I'm only sorry our colleagues who abandoned the tower couldn't be here with us.
Do you think I can get some rest now? I was so scared by the attack earlier... sigh... You did well!
When this is over, I want to visit Ziburynas Forest. Look back on the history of the Schaffenstar.
When this is over, I ought to focus on training the new members.
What Ignas did was shameless... But now the nightmare of the Astral Tower is over.
Oh, Revelator! Thanks to you, we can finally be happy again!
We took back the glory of the Schaffenstar, now it's time to restore it.
I guess the fight is over now. Don't think anyone else is gonna get hurt... right?
Sigh... I'm just glad everyone is safe from danger now.
The Astral Tower is ours again... I'm happy these wounds were not in vain...
You gave us hope when we most needed it. I am eternally grateful.
Soon we can all put this tragedy behind our backs. Thank you.
We should get these supplies back inside the tower now.
Battle's over, but I still need to fight these boxes of supplies...
Ah, Revelator. Thank you. We can finally be at ease.
I'm glad no one else is going to get hurt now. Thank you.

For over thousands of years, the swordsmen were the Kingdom's basic footsoldiers and the career of choice for budding adventurers. Many heroes that have risen to great heights started off as swordsmen. Despite the myriad of advancements in the tools and tactics utilized in warfare, swordsmen have always been an irreplaceable asset in battle.{nl}Classes in the Swordsman tree have the highest HP and DEF of all the class trees and can handle themselves adeptly in the heart of the battle.
Since their part in King Zachariel's war, Highlanders have been acting as Royal Guards for the aristocrats, protecting the palace and major cities of the Kingdom.

Barbarian legends claim that they were the original natives of the Kingdom before they migrated.{nl}Barbarians are aggressive warriors who will do anything for victory. 
Mounted troops are difficult to train and, because of this reason, they receive special treatment from the Kingdom. Masters that serve actively as soldiers are such a case.

Even if they are not an official part of the Royal Army, they are given the same treatment.{nl}Cataphracts are mounted warriors that bravely charge into enemy lines. 
The Doppelsoeldner are relatively new.

Their use of the shield makes them effective units against ranged attacks.
As gladiators, the Murmillo are not a formal military occupation but nor are they looked down upon by those in the regular forces.

They offer sturdy ranged defense with Cassis Crista or reinforced shield-based skills.

They are the most effective when using two-handed spears.

They became renown for their services during the War of the 2nd Succession where they fought fiercely in support of King Gliehel. Because of this, the Templars are given authority over all other military personnel by law during times of war.

Because of this, they are currently the rarest of all military units at the moment.{nl}Lancers are mounted units that are highly effective against footmen. They also have the ability to break through enemy structures and magic circles.

{/}{/}{#7AE4FF}{ol}[Available from the 2nd Advancement]{/}{/}{nl}Nak Muay have only recently appeared in the Kingdom.

The Nak Muay have always been and will continue to be the star of the arena.{nl}The Nak Muay are famous for their offense-driven nature and powerful melee strikes that are affected by STR.
Next to the Murmillo, the Retiarii have historically been the gladiators of the Kingdom's arena. They were formed around the 100th year of the gladiatorial matches and have always been a staple figure in these matches since their appearance. The Murmillo and Retiarii have influenced one another over the years of constant battle and it is said that it was the Retiarii that caused the Murmillo to start wearing their symbolic helmet.{nl}The Retiarii use one-handed spears, daggers and nets to capture the enemy and disarm them.
Hackapell could not gather in groups of more than 100 by the Kingdom's law. Due to this law, they have always acted as mercenaries in either small groups or as individuals. This is an outdated law that many feel is arbitrary in the current age, but it has still yet to be revised by the Kingdom's lawmakers.{nl}The Hackapell are highly mobile cavalry units that attack their enemies through various chained attacks.
Wizards are the backbone of all magic users in the Kingdom. Even when Agailla Flurry used to be the master of all magic, she would hire helpers that would assist her in her other duties while she kept working as a Wizard.{nl}Wizard skills cover larger areas and are effective against a larger number of enemies. Wizards can summon monsters to fight for them or assist party members with support spells.
Despite falling into the magician category, Pyromancers are also considered to be holy magicians in that they have a close relation with Gabija, the Goddess of Fire.

Most mages dabble in different schools of magic but Cryomancers tend to stick to their specialty. Cryomancers believe that they are the stern keepers of the Kingdom's tradition.{nl}Cyromancers specialize in ice magic which freezes and traps the enemy.
Strictly speaking, Psychokinos are not magicians but those with innate psychic abilities. As of recent, it was found that people without innate abilities could train to become Psychokinos.

The matriarch of the Winterspoon family was the first known Alchemist in the Kingdom and, to this day, the Winterspoons hold considerable influence in the world of alchemy. The basic rules that govern Alchemists were also first set up by the Winterspoons.{nl}Alchemists use alchemy to reinforce gems and create new items.
Sorcerers enhance and materialize the demonic souls and forces that permeate into our world, which is a celebrated feat in the field of magic. Historically, many sorcerers, with age, have suffered damage from these demonic forces they gained control over, so it is just as important for them to keep a healthy body, as well as a sound mind.{nl}Sorcerers are magicians that summon demons to do their bidding. They can mount or take control of the demons to fight on the field of battle.
Chronomancers hail from the school of magic that Agailla Flurry established before passing away.

They can quicken or slow time to assist their party members in combat.
Since the days of Agailla Flurry, the necromancy involving the use of the human body and soul has been abolished for good. Since then, Necromancers have reorganized themselves as a group of magic users who conduct studies on monsters and not humans.{nl}Necromancers are a class that brings dead monsters back to life. They can breathe life into the dead monsters to attack their target or create summons out of them.
Elementalists are scholars of magic that study how the elements that make up this world are moved by the will of the Goddesses. Their ultimate goal is to emulate this divine power to understand and gain control over the 4 basic elements that make up the material world.{nl}Elementalists are masters of the elements. They have powerful offensive spells but require some time to recuperate after each cast, so support from party members is recommended.
Sages are mostly made up of either aged scholars or government officials who have gained magic powers over the years. In the case of the latter, it is presumed that Sages obtain their power from being continuously exposed to the Divine Tree while working in the government for years.{nl}Sages reach enlightenment through years of accumulated knowledge to manipulate space using magic. They specialize in manipulating the different dimensions or creating portals that can be used for traveling to known locations.
People often wrongly assume that Warlocks harness the power of demons. But Warlocks are also children of the goddess, and as children often feel that they should not burden their parents, the Warlocks have a similar attitude. It is because of their unique and independent approach to spirituality that the Warlocks are an often misunderstood group.{nl}Warlocks are wizards who harness the power of evil spirits. They can summon evil spirits and command them to defeat monsters.
Magic and religion have parted ways and are currently two separate studies within the limits of the Kingdom. But for many nations outside the Kingdom's borders, they are still treated as one, and the Featherfoot is one such an example. Since Medzio Diena, the Kingdom has recognized many foreign shamans as either clerics or magicians within its realm and have helped them assimilate into the Kingdom in order to better seek their assistance in times of need.{nl}Featherfoots are wizards who utilize the power of incantations. They can absorb an enemy's life, or help allies by making enemies weak from a curse.
{/}{/}{#7AE4FF}{ol}[Available from the 2nd Advancement]{/}{/}{nl}There were never many Rune Casters in the Siauliai and Orsha areas. But since the Millenary, Rune Casters have spread throughout the Kingdom. Still, most of them can be found in the Northern districts of the Kingdom.{nl}Rune Casters are wizards who use ancient symbols imbued with magic. Although it takes some time to draw energy from the symbols, they contain enormous power.

The Onmyoji joined the Kingdom around 90 years ago during the Millenary. They had served the Kingdom for 50 years and declared themselves an independent group about 40 years ago. Though they still provide their services to the Kingdom, they are now acknowledged as an independent group much like the other clerics and wizards.{nl}The Onmyoji are able to summon divine spirits and use the magic of Yin and Yang in combat, which allows them to face a large number of opponents simultaneously.
Taoists harness the power of faith obtained through years of training. They believe that through their training that humans can achieve greatness akin to that of the goddesses. The Kingdom has acknowledged and sanctioned them as an official part of the Kingdom's clergy but where they come from such categorization means little.{nl}The Taoist class uses the power of Taoism. It is capable of using a talisman to attack enemies or help allies.
Bokors are a kind of mediators between humans and deity. Because of this, they are considered both magicians and clerics. They have migrated to the Kingdom from their tribal society around 900 years ago during the Reign of King Melkhiel and today they are more recognized as clergy than wizards.{nl}Bokors use voodoo skills to raise the dead or curse their enemies to attack them from afar.

They can defend against long-range attacks using their pavises, placing them in the ground.

Different arrows result in powerful attacks depending on the type of enemy and combat situation.

{#7AE4FF}{ol}[Available from the 2nd Advancement]{/}{nl}Appraisers are considered a friend by many.

It takes a lot of patience and control to become a Falconer because Falconers form relations and communicate with their Hawks, rather than simply tame them.

Hawks may be fussy, but they become reliable companions when trained well.
Cannoneers play a vital role in large-scale warfare, so most Cannoneer Masters are elected from the aristocracy. There has yet to be a commoner who rose to fill this position.

Even though they cannot use a bow at the same time, they have effective skills for continuous hits and close combat techniques.
The Mergen originate from a tribal society outside the Kingdom. Since Lydia Schaffen introduced them into the Kingdom, the Mergen Master has been officially sanctioned by the Kingdom but remained outside the Kingdom's jurisdiction, which meant that one had to travel over sea to become a Mergen. The Mergen Master has relocated to within the Kingdom's borders since Medzio Diena and now we see a lot more Mergen than before.{nl}The Mergen is a class that uses large bows and is most effective when facing numerous enemies.
Clerics are former apprentice clergymen who have completed their training. For thousands of years, the Clerics are a group that has devoted their lives to studying and worshipping the goddesses.{nl}Clerics have various skills that can either heal or buff allies in battle. They are largely a support class but they can be developed into a profession that plays a larger role in the front-lines as well as behind the scenes as support.
Many Priests worked near the Kingdom's capital and therefore were the Cleric class that took the most loss because of Medzio Diena. The oldest of the Priests who have survived Medzio Diena is known to be only around thirty years of age.{nl}Priests are clerics who give blessings and resurrect the dead with their holy powers.
Krivis are practitioners of traditional goddess worship. They uphold their tradition and authenticity of their arts and consist of many old Clerics. Most Krivis do not stray from the path they chose to walk, valuing their faith and traditions over all else.{nl}Krivis are priests who use divine fire to help allies recover or to deal massive damage to enemies.
Druids channel their powers via the goddesses by spiritually connecting with nature and materializing that spiritual power in the world. The Druids are clerics who use the power of nature.{nl}Druids take control of nature's powers to control plants and help allies in battle, or transform into monsters to use that monster's abilities.
Some enter clergy through learning, but other's receive a blessing from the goddesses directly to be chosen as their representative in the world. The Sadhu are a group that have been handpicked by the goddesses and trained to serve them directly in our world. They are more shamanistic in nature and are masters of dreams and sleep.{nl}A Sadhu can use their astral body to assault enemies with unseen attacks. 
There has only been one Dievdirbys Master since they were officially recognized as clergy by the Kingdom. That same Dievdirbys Master still holds his position to this day and everyone who has been trained as a Dievdirbys has at least once studied under Tesla, the Dievdirbys Master.{nl}Dievdirbys can carve and place sacred statues. Their statues can protect allies or attack enemies. 
Oracles are spokespersons for the goddesses, who answer the questions people may have for Them. The goddesses do not interfere in the free will of humans, so most prophecies are told through symbols and metaphors. Even now, when the goddesses are out of reach, Oracles can still deliver prophecies from the goddesses because They provide limitless wisdom despite being disconnected from the world.{nl}Oracles are clerics who possess foresight. They can predict or interfere with an enemy's attacks and determine their fate.
Monks are special clerics who worship the goddesses through physical training. They serve the goddesses and provide their services through physical prowess, acting of their own free will, instead of doing the goddesses' bidding by following Their prophecies.{nl}Monks are clerics who train in martial arts through the blessing of the goddesses.
Pardoners differ from other clerics in that they provide the goddesses' blessings as services for monetary gain. The Goddesses' Punishment, unlike the curse of demons, can only be lifted by Pardoners for a fee. Many Pardoners use the wealth they have gathered to make donations for the poor or for their own pleasure.{nl}Pardoners are clerics who don't shy away from increasing their wealth through the goddesses' blessing.
Paladins are clerics who fight for their beliefs in the goddesses and their loyalty for the Kingdom. The Tenet Church, built by the first of the Paladins, is a symbolic birthplace for the Paladins that they must defend at all costs.{nl}Paladins use their holy power to protect allies and vanquish enemies through the blessings of the goddesses.
The Chaplains are clerics that vowed to serve as priests in the battlefield. Once you become a Chaplain, you will remain a Chaplain for the rest of your life. They specialize in mending the broken spirit of soldiers who are fatigued by the inevitable slaughter of the battle and make use of the goddesses' powers to also assist them in action.{nl}Chaplains are a military class that uses divine power to aid allies in combat. Only advanced priests at a high level can become a Chaplain.
Plague Doctors differ from other clerics in that they do not rely as heavily on the powers of the goddesses. Plague Doctors make use of scientific studies in order to treat illness and because of this, they have remained in the shadows, as the blessings of the goddesses was enough to cure any illness prior to Medzio Diena. Plague Doctors have come into prominence with Medzio Diena when the goddesses became disconnected from our world.{nl}Plague Doctors are priests who can heal the status ailments of allies, or incinerate an enemy with a status ailment. Their special Bird Beak Mask has a special drug to block status ailments.
Kabbalists are a group that searches for the ultimate truth that governs the cosmos. They have predicted Medzio Diena in the past and also succeeded in deciphering Goddess Laima's prophecy of transferring the Kingdom's capital. Kabbalists are priests who practice the ancient magic known as Kabbalah. They can support allies by using infinite power or attack by using a defensive formation to disintegrate the enemy's name. 
Inquisitors have been the symbolic guardians of faith for many years. They are also in charge of scribing the teachings of the goddesses in words that can be better comprehended by the wider population. Since the goddesses have left this world because of Medzio Diena, Inquisitors have become a group that takes the lead and makes decisions with regards to the workings of all clergy.{nl}The Inquisitor is a class that judges those who are defying the goddesses. It has strong offensive techniques and is specialized in combat against magic users.
{#7AE4FF}{ol}[Available from the 2nd Advancement]{/}{/}{nl}Miko (Kannushi) have joined in the Kingdom's goddess worship earlier than the Onmyoji, but they are similar in that their services are not provided for the public in general. They have been involved in the incident surrounding Princess Kaonilla, but the story is not widely known by the public as it was a business of the Royal courts.{nl}Miko (Kannushi) receive prophecies and serve the goddesses. They attack enemies with Holy property attacks or give buffs to their allies by raising their spirits.
Zealots were formed by clergy that began walking the hard line after the goddesses left this world. Their method of worship is deemed rather extreme and hence there is much friction between the Zealots and other clergies. Their goal as a group is to establish and enforce strict doctrines that follow the goddesses' teachings and return them to this world.{nl}The Zealot is specialized in enhancing oneself through the use of buffs for physical melee attacks.
Many Clerics have dabbled in exorcism before, but the Order of the Exorcists was established during the time in which Lomel II facilitated the organization of the many orders and denominations of clerics. From then on, only those sanctioned by the court were recognized as Exorcists and were allowed to perform exorcisms.{nl}Exorcists use magic of divine properties to expel evil energies and overthrow demonic enemies.
Scouts started off during the reign of King Melkhiel, where they acted in gathering information at the borders during the war. After the Kingdom's borders were expanded, the Scouts were given the task of tracking and hunting monsters.{nl}The Scout class has a wide array of offensive skills and high evasion and critical rates. They are an offense-oriented class but are known to consume SP quickly.
Assassin
Assassins are a group that has originated from outside the Kingdom and have never officially been sanctioned by the Kingdom. Their notoriety is unsurpassed and because of this, no one dares question the leaders of the Assassins calling themselves 'Masters'. Unlike the Kingdom's other classes, the Assassins are active even outside of the Kingdom's limits.{nl}Assassins are a dagger-wielding class that makes use of plants called Hasisas that grant them advantage in battle.
Outlaw
Outlaws are the rulers of the Kingdom's underworld. There is no way they can receive official sanction from the Kingdom, but the Kingdom's population at large cannot deny the authority held by the Outlaw Masters. It is said that Outlaws wield an influence that reaches all over the Kingdom and even as far as the Royal Palaces.{nl}The Outlaw is a class that is not restricted by weapon types. Their fighting style may seem dirty, but they are highly efficient street fighters.
The laws regarding the aristocracy in the Kingdom have been fortified over the years and many aristocrats have become de-classed as commoners. Many of these former aristocrats trained their children as Squires, which gave birth to the class. Although Squires have established themselves as a respectable profession, they are still at times looked down as de-classed aristocrats.{nl}Squires are warriors who support their allies. They support by repairing and enhancing the weapons of their allies, or by setting up a base camp to aid their team.
Corsairs were privateers who were awarded a token of authority during the reign of King Lomel. Being privateers, they were only unofficial in status but today they have gained official acknowledgment of the Kingdom. This does not mean that they are free to do as they wish but they reserve the right to remain armed and cannot be punished without a solid conviction and evidence.{nl}Corsairs group their allies into bands to deploy unique combat tactics. They loot the enemy's items, find treasure chests and use the combo system in battle. 
{/}{/}{#7AE4FF}{ol}[Available from the 2nd Advancement]{/}{/}{nl}Experts of espionage and covert action exist in all places at all times. The Shinobi, since their contribution was recognized by the Kingdom in the First War of Succession, have acted as the Kingdom's agents in the shadows. To this day, the Shinobi play a vital role in protecting the Kingdom's interests.{nl}Shinobis are warriors who are familiar with special tactics called Ninjutsu. Only a few can overcome the long and harsh training required to become a Shinobi.
Thaumaturges, unlike other wizards, do not learn magic but develop talents while understanding how magic works. Because of this difference, latent magical abilities are considered the most important characteristic of a successful Thaumaturge.{nl}Thaumaturges use magic that change the attributes and size of targets. They can shrink enemies or strengthen allies to aid them in battle.
The history of the Enchanter class is relatively short. Jane, Agailla Flurry's apprentice, could not use magic and did not pass on her studies to any apprentice but her studies lay the groundwork for what would later become the art of Enchanting.{nl}The Enchanter class is able to help allies by crafting consumable items or enhancing equipment.
Linkers seek out the links between different materials and use these links to draw a specified result. Their arts center around finding the hidden links between worldly objects and the imagination to apply and appropriate those links to cause a new effect.{nl}Linkers link allies together to reduce incoming damage, or connect enemies to amplify the inflicted damage.
Rogues were wanted felons in the Kingdom but have gained pardon after they assisted many great adventurers in their quests. Around 300 years ago, during Nachel I's reign, they gained a pardon that grants them immunity from punishment unless their crimes were something as serious as murder or treason.{nl}Rogues will do anything to win in battle. They are a class specialized in stealthily ambushing their targets from behind.
Schwarzer Reiters are one of the main military units forming the Royal Army and have existed since the reign of Sawsel II. They have only recently begun mercenary work but their number grew small as they began to be grouped under Royal service as special forces.{nl}Schwarzer Reiters maneuver quickly. They specialize in diverse shooting techniques using a pistol.
Bullet Markers have only been established and come into prominence in the current age. Being a new class, Flint Winterwood is the first of the class masters. The future of the class is in the hands of those who will carry on the Bullet Marker name.

Pennamayo
No one is yet aware as to how this little bird came to be such a ferocious beast.
Frocoli
Since Medzio Diena, people have tried to hunt Frocoli to use as a source of food. Although they found out they weren't edible, they found out that their oil could be used to light fires.
Amphibigola
Golas are creatures that exist both in our world as well as the demon realm. While the Golas of the demon realm have higher intelligence, Amphibigolas are named so due to their amphibious nature. 
Infro Crabil
Crabils are big enough as they are but Infro Crabils are even bigger and stronger.
Spider
It is just a regular spider, only massively enlarged. It is one of the strangest creatures to appear since Medzio Diena in that it is so ordinary in appearance.
Tooter
This monster is known to let out a long howl similar to that of a large bull. Some say it even sounds like a wind instrument.
Ghosnatus
Ghosnatus are formed from the ghosts of men who used to be murderes.
Moringponia
Giltine needed powerful demons in order to interfere in the plans of the Goddess Laima. She had organized the Demon Lords as her very own elite demon army, which Moringponia was a part of. Ever since being elected into the ranks, Moringponia had been after Laima's Revelations under orders from Baiga. Moringponia was elected as a Demon Lord relatively late in comparison to others in her ranks, but seeing that she answers personally to Baiga tells that she is not to be taken lightly because of this.
Tantalizer
Giltine needed powerful demons in order to interfere in the plans of the Goddess Laima. She had organized the Demon Lords as her very own elite demon army, which Tantalizer was a part of. Tantalizer had since begun working under Kartas, during the time which he had secretly been in contact with Baiga and taking his orders as well. 
Amacalf
Schaffenstar members often make fun of the monster's short legs. 
Rudas Elavine
The scholars claim that a different kind of Elavine exists somewhere in this world but they have yet to find any proof of this. 
Velsoarer
The scholars had long considered Velsoarers to be demons but they have recently come to realize that it is actually a mutated beast of some sort.
Velpod
It is still under debate which plant the spores of a Velpod actually come from.
Cloverin
The spores of a Cloverin can be found spread across almost all of the Kingdom, although they are less seldom seen in the northern parts of the Kingdom where the climate is colder.
Rafflet
New plant monsters such as the Rafflet, are being discovered every day in the Great Woodlands, which is a heavily forested area with a sparse population density.
Ghoscandle
Ghoscandles are formed out of souls of deceased humans. As you can tell from its appearance, only the vilest and the most perverted humans become Ghoscandles after their souls leave their body.
Gigglecat
Little is known about the Gigglecat, a ghostly demon that lets out a spine chilling giggle every once in a while.
Infro Gremlin
Blueberrin
They're cute but they can't be tamed nor can they be eaten as food.  
Delione
Despite its appearances, Delione does not belong to an independent species of plants but is a mutation of an already known plant species. Many plant monsters like these have begun to appear since Medzio Diena.
Fragolin
Fragolin is one of the newer monsters that have only recently been found by the adventurers of the Kingdom. Most of these new monsters are found in the areas around the Fallen City.
Chesha Papa
They say that Chesha Papas are not affected by the force of gravity.
Chesha Venom
It is said that Chesha Venom's poison rots the mind of the victims that are weak willed.
Ghosbebe
Ghosbebes are demons created from souls of humans that had been a clergyman during their lives. 
Ghoscat
Ghoscats are former pets that have become demons. They are lovable pets to demons but are known as vicious murderers to humans. 
Gland
Glands always aim for a specific part of the human body when attacking. Because of this, It is believed that this demon has some knowledge of the human anatomy. 
Grievous Wheel
These demons are said to be found mostly in the areas ruled by Baiga as the terrain there is flat.
Banterers are a friendly lot among demons. Unlike other demons, Banterers are known to be friendly amongst demons but their hostility towards humans is not all that different from the other demons.
Arch Gargoyle
People doubt that they will ever come across any other gargoyles larger than the Arch Gargoyle, aptly named because of their unusually large size. Even if so, their names will probably remain unchanged.
Hooter
Despite having been mutated in Medzio Diena, they can still make the sounds they used to make before they were transformed. 
Kisylion
Originally believed to be herbivores, Kisylions have grown a taste for meat since Medzio Deina. They prone to gathering left-over meat than hunt for themselves, but are dangerous creatures nonetheless.
Monitor Lizard
This monster is known to observe the objects around it when it thinks that no one is looking. A scholar has even gone as far as to confirm this by casting an invisibility spell on himself.
Red Grievous Wheel
Red Banterer
Red Gland
Chesa Torso
The sewers of the major cities of the Kingdom were well maintained before Medzio Diena. But now the sewers have become a growing pain, providing habitat for mutant monsters such as these.
Chesha Riel
Chesha Riels are believed to be a result of Mutant-type monsters that have been possessed by evil spirits.
Chesha Needle
No one has yet witnessed this monster actually sewing something.
