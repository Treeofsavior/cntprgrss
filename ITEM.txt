Plague Doctor Helmet
Ever since the very first Paladin did, many people throughout the ages have guarded the Tenet Church. All those years of accumulated experience have been drawn upon to create this combination of power and convenience.
Most attempts at keeping plants in check with other plants after Medzio Diena have failed, but after the ability to drain the energy of plant monsters of a certain fern was discovered, it has been applied to weapons.
Equipment specialized against beast monsters have developed due to the environment of the Lucas Region. It is rare for a region to be as untouched by the Great Plant Cataclysm as Lucas, and this scarcity became the basis on which this equipment was produced.
It is uncommon for Kingdom fortresses to be built with wood or dirt. As such, it is a nuisance in strongly fortified regions when the stones or minerals that form castles become monsters and thus require effective weaponry when such incidents occur.
Agailla Flurry decided to leave one recipe in celebration of completing the epitaph. The recipe, which was all but forgotten for hundreds of years after her death, was only reevaluated after Medzio Diena. Only now the effectiveness of Flurry's recipe against insects is being highlighted.
The exact origins and creator of this weapon recipe are unknown. Some speculate that it was created by a nameless master, but most experts think that it was created incognito by someone famous due to certain circumstances.
One does not have to be a priest to embark on a pilgrimage. As long as they look up to the goddess and are on pilgrimage, it matters not if they are mage, archer, or of other professions. Of course, it helps if the weapon they are used to is threatening to demons.
In a certain period of history, the Istora region was famous as a retirement place for scholars. There was a temporary exchange of various academics in the region achieving new inventions and discoveries. The Istora Sword is one of those achievements.
The aim of the sacred pact centered around the Tenet Church is the eventual defeat of the Demon Queen. It is said that the creators of this sword prayed that it would be able to gravely wound the Demon Queen.
Magical application of the stealing energy from competing plants and secretion of harmful substances to weapons is a very difficult task. The fact that it succeeded in less than three years shows the urgency of the situation.
Regions with relatively less plant growth after Medzio Diena saw an increase in beast activity. This equipment is the result of such regional developments.
The stones and other material used to build the 3 layer castle wall near the capital rarely mutated into monsters. This was thanks to precautions against various catastrophies dating back to the founding of the kingdom. However, castles in other regions did not have such measures and now require weapons against monsters after Medzio Diena.
Agailla Flurry devised a magical weapon that had two advantages in which a non-mage could use it and would exhibit it's true value after Medzio Diena. However, it is still uncertain if she foresaw Medzio Diena.
There is a theory that even those who like to throw wild guesses approach with caution. The theory that the original creator of the Krag Sword, based on the techniques applied and when it was first produced, is Ruklys.
Despite the goddesses interacting with humans in numerous places, it was only natural for the places where they had been or performed miracles to overlap or converge. The production and spreading of goods for those people was inevitable.
According to certain radicalists, Istora weapons are said to utilize source energy of goddesses. There is no definate proof to their claims.
The aim of the sacred pact centered around the Tenet Church is the eventual defeat of the Demon Queen. The development of easy to handle weapons that are deadly to demons is only reasonable.
The application of plant regulation effects based on plants on to blunt weapons is even more difficult. It may weaken the weapon before being used on an enemy.
The Lukas Rod is one of the earliest applied examples of magic being used to fight beasts in this region.
Weapons made from weaker materials must be empowered with stronger magic as many Mutant-type monsters are relatively robust.
Insect monsters before Medzio Diena were few and less ferocious. Those were the good old days where a mage could make do with a simple magically enhanced weapon.
The people who support the Ruklys origin theory of this weapon say that Ruklys created them in order to give them to his diverse followers. The people that oppose the theory say that although Ruklys is indeed a talented warrior, he lacks the broad experience needed create different weapons.
Demons were the largest obstacle for pilgrims even before Medzio Diena. These weapons had become a dependable method of defense for pilgrims that could not afford bodyguards.
The opinion that Istora weapons are linked to divine power originating from the goddesses instead of magic or natural power is refuted by the fact that the weapon demonstrates its abilities against Mutant-type monsters.
The bowcrafters were once proud that their bow was created in an independent way and had nothing to do with the Astral Tower.
To craft this bow requires the effort of waiting for the moment a fern blooms at a special time in a place nobody can see. As a matter of fact, all magic that changes the life of a fern into death has roots in such custom rituals.
According to some, this weapon reacts to the unique scents of animals.
Projectile weapons must be crafted so the body itself becomes the magic source and continuously transfers energy and makes it so that the user does not need to be involved directly in the process. It is better if the weapon can recover magic on it's own instead of having to put in ample amounts of magic.
According to some, Agailla Flurry said that even Demon Lord Diena would have been easily defeated if this bow had been in the hands of Lydia Schaffen. Of course it would not be completely ineffective even in the hands of someone else.
Some say that the reason there is no record of Lydia Schaffen evaluating this bow is because the bow and the recipe did not exist at the time. They say that it is unlikely that, given her personality, there would not be any criticism if the recipe existed during Ruklys. Therefore, they argue that all of these Krag items are later designs.
Even weapons as light as bows can deal enormous amounts of damage to Mutant-type monsters. If they are Istora weapons.
The Tenet Crossbow is the most recently designed and produced weapon by the Tenet Church members.
Before Medzio Diena, the ritual of watching the ferns blooming was thought to been for fulfilling wishes or good luck, but all aspects of human life have completely changed since then.
This weapon reacts to the slightest movement of the target after hitting it. However, only the finest movement is required making the delay almost non-exinstant.
Not all Philis weaponry was crafted based on the same magic. In this case, the projectile damages the cause behind the mutation instead of containing magic harmful to the monsters.
Scholars must receive some credit for the resurgence of Flurry's recipe after Medzio Diena. Their tireless exploration and the advancements in epigraphy were some of the reasons the recipe was revitalized and how the weapon could be realized at an opportune moment.
The Krag Crossbow is mainly thought to have appeared in Lydia Schaffen's latter years thanks to her records. However, some say that it had existed before that time but had not been mentioned by her.
The Pilgrim Crossbow was the weapon of choice for pilgrims that were better off. It is only human nature to want to be able to attack from further and more easily than you can with a magic rod.
The Istora region was once famous as a retirement place for scholars and thanks to their intercourse, saw many discoveries and inventions that are still being improved to this day. In the case of the Istora crossbow, that improvement happened after Medzio Diena.
The Tenet Mace is the base of all weaponry related to the Tenet Church. It existed since the first Paladin and is the first weapon which was infused with magic that would later be used on other weapons.
Some say that the goddesses had hidden mysterious powers in ferns long ago, and think that is why fern observing rituals before Medzio Diena and applying power to weapons after Medzio Diena is possible. No in depth research has been done by theologians or priests despite the ritual being ancient.
Wild animals are frequently encountered enemies for novices and pilgrims. They must be tamed by magic if they cannot be swayed by the goddesses.
Some priests think that weapons used against Mutant-type monsters should be crafted with diverse materials. The complicated process of metal reinforcement, filling it with divine energy and infusion of magic are applied simultaneously to this weapon.
Recipes for maces have been passed through time without being lost. The main reason behind this is because there is a strong atmosphere considering anything related to the legends Maven amongst priests. Thanks to that atmosphere, there were records of Flurry's recipe allowing it to utilized.
Some believe the weapon has the power to break boulders because of the name.
It is the weapon of choice for priests when starting a pilgrimage. Whatever the reason may be, there is a definate tendency amongst priests to be comfortable with and prefer maces.
Opinions are emerging saying that scholars should also help resolve the catastrophies Medzio Diena brought as artifacts such as the Istora Mace are being brought back into the light.
It is difficult to infuse magic to separable weaponry. It is also hard for ordinary people to figure out if the magic used to fight demons is infused in the shaft or head of spears.
The magic symbol Koru is hidden on this spear in the form of a fern sprout. Sprouts have long been symbols of great religious import.
It is inadvisable to use this weapon for hunting even though it may cause greater damage to beasts. It has always been safer to rely on traps and snares when hunting.
It is said that masters of this weapon can remove it from monsters after throwing it from a great distance and attack with it again. Some however point out that this combat style is inefficient.
Unfortunately, parts of the Escanciu Spear recipe have been lost. However, substituting the unknown ingredients with others based on different weapons still created the desired effects. The only problem is that it is unkown if they are the ingredients that Flurry first thought of.
There is no doubt that this weapon is a great help in hunting monsters no matter the circumstances that caused the creator to hide behind the name Krag.
Wild animals are as much of an obstacle to pilgrims as demons. The spear used to be chosen as it is effective against both enemies, requires less care than projectile weapons and can also be used as a cane.
According to some theories, the Istora Spear had an original form unlike different Istora weapons which became the roots on which other Istora weaponry was invented.
It was crafted with the durability to withstand charging Mutant-type monsters.
Insectoid monsters occasionally attack from the air. Therefore, users of this weapon must prepare against air attacks from insectoid monsters.
The largest weakness of theory that Krag weapons were crafted by Ruklys is that it cannot explain the fact that the weapon would not be named as such if it had been crafted prior to the betrayal, and that there would not have been enough time to craft it afterwards.
A weapon that clearly shows that pilgrams truly come from all walks of life. Those that are not afraid of becoming burdens may opt to choose this weapon.
The Istora Pike is said to be the first Istora weapon to be crafted from methods discovered from the Istora Spear.
Weapons based on the Tenet Church were not all conceived at the same time. The staff was crafted relatively late when compared to it's simplicity, and was completed when efforts to maintain different ingredients that have different magic retention times succeeded.
Death was already immanent within the rapid growth behind the explosive increase of plants. It draws as near as life force is used for rapid growth and magic gained from ferns has the same effect on plants.
Though it may seem contradictory, the people that assited the most in crafting this weapon to be effective against beasts are people that had professions related to the care of animals.
Infusing magic against Mutant-type monsters is more difficult than one may think. It must repress the tendency of objects trying to mutate after Medzio Diena as well as being susceptible to magic as a weapon.
Some theorize that the reason Agailla Flurry thought of crafting a weapon effective against insectoid monsters is because nobody had bothered to do so before her.
Those that support the Ruklys origin theory say that the name was changed as he had been declared as a traitor. However, they cannot explain why the name Krag was chosen.
There are numerous locations in the kingdom which contain legends and stories of the goddesses as they have been with us for a long time. It is only natural for there to be pilgrims traveling to those locations and seek measures to make it a safer journey.
There are some that believe that Mutant-type monsters receive more damage from Istora weapons because they are go against the laws of nature.

Long ago, a goddess suggested the crafting of objects to the other goddesses. Most of the goddesses that heeded their colleague's suggestion mainly did so out of amusement, but the goddess that suggested it meant to leave the objects containing the divine powers of the goddesses in the world for the generations to come. One of those arrangements are these gloves
A long time ago, several goddesses made objects containing divine power for their own amusement. It is said that they did so in the Goddess' Ancient Garden but it is difficult to know if this is true. Whatever the case may be, the objects crafted at the time, such as these boots, are still proving their worth.
The fact that the authority of the goddesses is indirectly being used against enemies through the objects they crafted carries great significance even if the goddesses did not put their heart and souls into crafting them.
Long ago, when the goddesses crafted mystical objects for their amusement in the Goddess' Ancient Garden, some were crafted by coating existing ones with their divine power. These clothes are such examples.
It is uncertain if whether the Goddess' Ancient Garden where these gloves were crafted indicates the same location as the Goddess' Ancient Garden known today. Whatever the location may be, the gloves were certainly made in the Goddess' Ancient Garden.
The fact that there are no separate recipes for Ogva equipment is indirect proof that indicates that the origins lie with the goddesses.
Of the many theories, the theory that Laima was the first goddess to propose the crafting of Ogva equipment to the goddesses is the most convincing.
It is unknown if the Goddess' Ancient Garden in which Ogva equipment was said to have been crafted indicates the same location that is known today or how long ago the events took place. However, it is widely believed that it took place before written history.
Some believe that there is an all powerful piece of equipment that contains extreme amounts of divine power based on the fact that Ogva equipment is completed by the goddesses' divine power and spend their lives trying to find it. Of course, all such efforts resulted in failure and it is unknown if there actually is such a piece of equipment. However, those searches did result in the discovery of previously unknown equipment such as these gloves.
We cannot know which powers were given to the various pieces of equipment by certain goddesses long ago in the Goddess' Ancient Garden. However, we can make assumptions. These boots most likely have the divine power of Zemyna.
Some complain that the goddesses should have given this piece of equipment better durability and strength when compared to others.
It is unknown how Ogva equipment were spread and revealed to the world. However, too much time has passed to find those origins.
There have been attempts to control plants with other plants since Medzio Diena. These pieces of equipment are one of the successfully applied cases of those attempts.
It is a difficult task to magically apply the self protection substances of ferns to weapons after Medzio Diena. The goddesses must be thanked for the fact that those efforts succeeded.
There are two methods in crafting magical equipment. One is to follow the recipe from the beginning and the other is to infuse pre-existing equipment. It is the latter in the case of this piece of equipment.
It was relatively easy to apply the magic derived from ferns that saw explosive growth after Medzio Diena to offensive equipment. There are cases where the effects changed or weakened in the case of protective equipment such as in the case of this outfit.
The effort of waiting for the moment a fern blooms in a special place where noone can see is required to craft these gloves. The patience and concentration is rewarded by the gloves enhancing the accuracy of the wearer.
The ritual of watching a fern bloom before Medzio Diena was thought to be a custom for wish fulfillment or good luck, but just like all life has changed afterwards, is now a method of applying magic to protective equipment such as this.
Some are of the belief that the fern observing rituals and the reason that power can be applied to equipment after Medzio Diena is because the goddesses hid mystical powers in ferns long ago. No in depth research has been done by theologians or priests despite the ritual being ancient.
The magic symbol Koru is hidden on this outift in the form of a fern sprout. Sprouts have long been symbols of great religious import.
The individual rings that comprise these gloves have been crafted through the application of magical powers symbolized by fern buds. Magical equipment with this sort of power may not be craftable if the vegetation abnormality disappears one day.
All vegetation that saw explosive growth after Medzio Diena possess some degree of life and energy absorption. To apply this ability to equipment and allow it to absorb energy from the earth is a very difficult task.
Magic extracted from ferns can be made to possess either light seeking or shunning characteristics. However, it is made to resist darkness even if it is theoretically possible to make it resist light due to cost and practicality reasons.
There was a time when Divdirbys master Tesla used to roam the kingdom. Some pieces of magic equipment have tales of his travels. People usually accept such legends even though it is uncertain how the sculptor priest Tesla influenced the crafting of these gloves.
There is a legend of Tesla crafting these boots after being pricked by a thorn in the foot whilst passing Sirdgela Forest. Whether the forest was filled with thorns or if Tesla really crafted the boots after such an experience is not important. Nobody has gone to ask Tesla even though he is alive and well.
Sirdgela equipment is full of legend and story. Some say that these pants were crafted with cloth woven from thread gathered from brambles. There are many people that are fond of the figure of the lonely girl who makes thread from brambles regardless of whether those tales are true or not.
Those that like to seek the stories related to magical items say that these robes were crafted when Tesla decided become a priest as well as an ordinary sculptor. The psychology of people whom like to attach mystical stories to Sirdgela equipment is a field worth researching.
The reason Sirdgela equipment has more diverse and mystical stories than other magical equipment may be influenced by the unique environment of being a Thorn Forest. However, if that is the case, it means that all the stories are from after Medzio Diena making them works of fiction.
According to legend, there were many soldiers going missing in or near Sirdgela, and these boots were crafted by the families and friends looking for their lost ones.
Developments in the use of leather gained from wild animals that have always infested Sirdgela Forest are said to have been the origins behind this outfit.
It is said that many wild animals existed in Sirdgela even before the increase of monsters after Medzio Diena. These gloves are said to have existed since then.
Although this is only one of the many theories that surrounds Sirdgela equipment, it is said that these boots have been traditionally crafted in the Sirdgela region to traverse rough terrain.
It becomes evidence of an item being crafted long ago in a different environment if magical properties that are unrelated to the weather of a location is infused with equipment.
Philis Gloves are said to have had more magic before Medzio Diena. The reasons behind the weakening of magic after the collapse of the 3 layer castle wall on Medzio Diena remains unknown.
Philis equipment is characterized by it's ability to provide it's wearers with pleasantness in closed environments.
This equipment, which used to be the full-dress uniform of the guards of the 3 layer castle wall, had special magical treatment for reasons only known by the leading members of the army. However, it seems that those reasons will be difficult to figure out as all the high ranking officers are dead.
The regulation issued uniforms of the guards of the 3 layer castle wall were produced in various forms according to their needs. These gloves were produced with ordinary siege warfare in mind.
The regulation issued uniforms of the guards of the 3 layer castle wall were produced in various forms according to their needs. These boots were produced with ordinary siege warfare in mind.
Unlike other pieces of Philis equipment, this piece did not exist before Medzio Diena. It was recently infused with magical properties out of necessity.
It was only issued to the outer wall guards during the early years of the kingdom. It was thought to be useful under the assumption that the outer wall was taken. It was later issued to all 3 walls as tactics and weapons of siege warfare changed.
It is the most useful equipment with magical properties not only all castle guards including those on the 3 layers. It has existed as a favorite of many guards for a long time.
This was equipment issued to guards, especially those that were in charge of attacking with fire on the 3 layer castle wall. An interesting theory that is brought up even now is that those guards may have been able to stop the catastrophic growth of vegetation from the capital which is now in ruins.
Although it is a strange phenomenon, the activities of mages and production of magical items is relatively active in the Allerno Barony when compared to other fiefs. This phenomena has increased dramatically after Medzio Diena and these gloves have appeared in such circumstances.
The increase in magical items in the Allerno barony is hard to explain especially when it has always been an agricultural region. Whatever the reason may be, the people fighting in the region can attribute these boots to that phenomenon.
At first glance, it may not seem strange that there are many magical items such as this outfit because there has been an influx of mages to the Allerno barony. However, this is not the truth and the increase in magical items and new inventions are being caused by something else.
Some mages tried to find if whether the new appearances of magical items in the Allerno region is due to demons but failed to do so. Items that resist darkness such as this are proof that the theory is unlikely.
Whatever the reason behind the sudden appearance of items may be, they are actively gathering and issuing such items to men in Allerno barony. This may be the reason behind mounting conflicts between the residents and soldiers in the region.
It is certain that the Allerno region is being magically influenced from the outside. Although it may not be an impressive amount, the fact still stands that these boots regardless of their performance show new methods of magic infusion.
Another strange point about the magical items that have appeared in the Allerno region is that the mages that come here do not seek them. The items that are discovered are being used by residents or soldiers.
The current lord of Allerno has hired mages and craftsmen in order to further enhance the equipment that already has strong defensive powers. It is said that such moves are hiding other reasons.
If the lord of Allerno did not simply hire the mages and craftsmen to enhance the magical equipment, there is a chance that his goal may be connected to why such items are suddenly appearing.
The lord of Allerno wishes that rarer and stronger magical items will be discovered in his lands. While greed is also behind such thinking, it is also difficult to reproduce the items that have been discovered.
The lord of Allerno is trying to wear this equipment after enhancing it. It is said that he hired mages and craftsmen for this very reason.
There are cases of divine power residing in items that had been carried by priests for a long time. Perelin gloves were crafted as a successful result of trying to have these happenings occur reliably when needed.
There are cases in which the divine power of goddesses indwells and shows new powers in trivial items that poor pilgrims were carrying on their pilgrimage. Equipment with the name Perelin are such items.
It cannot be known what type of protection is indwelling in which pilgrim's items. However, there is some regularity even though generalities have not been discovered. Otherwise, these items would not be able to have the name Perelin.
Many different kinds of experiments are enacted in order to craft Perelin items. The most widely known experiment was to have the pilgrims wear the equipment until divine power resides in it. The results indicate that this does not increase the chance of divine power indwelling in the equipment.
There are increased chances of items becoming Perelin items in the case of making pilgrims perform various tasks whilst wearing the equipment such as these gloves. However, it cannot be seen as a precise recipe as the exact moment that they receive divine power is unknown.
The effects of Perelin items do not disappear even if given to other people after realizing that they have become Perelin items during the pilgrimage. There is no firm principle behind the creation of Perelin items even though pilgrims that have had a piece of equipment turn into Perelin items before usually are able to have more.
Inquiries of whether pilgrims living pious lives makes the authority of goddesses reside in items and whether the creation of items with even more profound abilities is possible is still ongoing. It is only natural if taking the tough living conditions after Medzio Diena.
It is unknown why such phenomena occurs to pilgrims instead of pious priests that stay in one place. It is made even more unclear by the fact that there are certain cases proving otherwise. The most simple answer is that everything is done in the will of the goddesses.
Although it may seem obvious, these Perelin gloves appear frequently on Paladins.
Perelin items do not always appear on priests. There are numerous cases in which Perelin gloves have appeared on warrior type believers.
The principle behind the natural appearance of Perelin items may never be realized. However, people keep trying to find it thanks to the divine protection that they provide.
According to legend, the first person to obtain Perelin equipment was the first Paladin master. However, it is unclear if this is the truth as the Tenet Church refuses to verify such trivial stories.
Many mages have crafted numerous magical items in the mage tower since Agailla Flurry's death. Most of the creators are anonymous despite several of the items still being used to this day. These are designated as Turn equipment.
Turn equipment have nothing more in common than the fact that they have their origins in the Mage tower. They are simply named as such due to the need to indicate equipment from the tower after Flurry.
Some Turn equipment is suspected to have been made by the same mage due to the similarities in their effects. As in the Turn pants and the Turn robe. But the possibility that they may have been crafted by different mages of different times can't be ruled out.
There was a time when the mages of the Mage Tower after Flurry's death isolated themselves from the world and focused on their experiments and research. Although there were many whimsical inventions during that time, the only partially practical inventions that remain are these Turn gloves.
According to some, Turn equipment may have had better power in the beginning. However, there are no remaining items or recipes due to the reclusive nature of mages. Most of the equipment left has about the same amount of magic as these boots.
There are several cases where they were created out of necessity of mages. It is said that Turn leather pants were created on the spot to protect mages when conducting experiments with lightning.
There are several cases where they were created out of necessity of mages. It is said that Turn leather tunics were created on the spot to protect mages when conducting experiments with lightning.
Some Turn equipment has been reinforced or applied in various ways while being used outside of the Mage Tower. The first known case of such enhancements are these gloves.
There was a time where metallic equipment was not crafted because of the many experiments conducted by mages after Flurry's death. Therefore, the existing metallic Turn equipment may have originated from mages but have been completed by anonymous contributors outside of the Mage Tower.
Unlike other metallic Turn equipment, Turn plate leggings are being crafted by mages. It is said that they were used when mages were attempting to fly.
Metallic equipment was not made for centuries after Flurry's death because there was a shortage of metals thanks to the many experiments conducted by mages. As such, even though the existing metallic Turn equipment may have originated from mages, the actual craftsmen are anonymous people from outside the Mage Tower.
The Druid Master from Shaton and tried to make the region safer after Medzio Diena by providing or helping the crafting of equipment. There are cases in which non-combatant farmers have received help from these gloves.
The Druid Master is sending several of her disciples to Shaton to perform various tasks not only out of the love of her hometown but also becuase it is related to her Nature Restoration Plan. The local residents are imitating a few of the simple magic equipment that are used to keep the disciples safe.
The Druid Master does not put restrictions on the Shaton locals imitating the magical equipment that she provided. Therefore, some are being used by people from neighboring regions or explorers, such as these pants.
People being harassed by monsters after Medzio Diena require easily obtainable magical equipment. However, such support is not easy to receive due to several complications. The situation is bad enough that sometimes soldiers fighting monsters on the front lines are not able to obtain equipment they need. The fact that the Druid Master is using her power and resources for the Shaton region is a small but noble act.
Shaton equipment provides diverse amenities for the livelihood of the locals even if they do not fight monsters. Even farmers and lumberjacks need to be accurate.
Some settlers from the Shaton region have disappeared with the equipment. It is unclear if they made a run for it after obtaining equipment or have fallen victim to monsters. Both are equally as likely to have happened. The fact that many of those that have disappeared are people that have obtained boots suggests a certain possibility.
The percentage of settlers in the Shaton region being burned while working has decreased dramatically after this outfit has been issued.
The Druid Master also freely gave help to the nobles of the Shaton region. As a result, the nobility of Shaton was able to increase their survivability when combating monsters.
Some express their concerns that the way the Druid Master unconditionally gave magical items to the Shaton nobility might have been a bad idea. They argue that metallic equipment such as these leggings need not have been provided. In the end however, what is more important is whether the people using the equipment do so with good or bad intentions.
There are some of the belief that it is more important that people are protected from monsters even if they are abusing the Druid Master's goodwill. Such people praise the Druid Master for providing metallic armor.
Many people have found various means to donate to the Tyla Monastery which is a historic religious facility. Those donations became the foundations to the emergence to magical equipment unique to the Tyla Monastery.
Some of the Tyla Monastery equipment was improved with the consent of the original donor. Many people could receive the benefits of such equipment because the Tyla Monastery does not monopolize these items.
The equipment made by the wealth and magical equipment donated to the Tyla Monastery helped people greatly when the surrounding region became a thorn forest. Of course the people that benefited the most were the monks of the Monastery.
The reason why the Tyla Monastery receives particularly more contributions and donations is because it has historically been more lenient towards rulebreakers. The Tyla Monastery has treated sinners and lawbreakers alike gently focusing on reformation instead of punishment in accordance to the Monastery's traditions.
Tyla Monastery has been able to play it's role as a strict self-sufficient religious belief community for priests for a long time without losing sight of the original ideals thanks to it's principles of being strict towards monks and tolerant of outsiders. As such, some magical equipment here has been used in everyday life instead of combat as can be similarly observed in other regions. This is the representative example of such equipment.
Meeting goddesses before Medzio Diena was not uncommon. Even so, criminals who were shameful of their past deeds wished the Tyla Monastery would be a window between themselves and the goddesses and the many that were reformed donated to the Monastery providing the foundations of current Tyla Monastery equipment.
Even equipment that may have been thought to be useless due to the climate of Tyla Monastery became useful after Medzio Diena. This piece of equipment is such a case.
Even the royal family is on the donator list of Tyla Monastery. Many people can wear good metallic equipment thanks to the fact that the Monastery does not hesitate even in distributing royal gifts if useful to the people.
Tyla Monastery was generous in the distribution of all magical equipment they deem can be useful to the people since the royal family did not attach any strings when gifting equipment to the monastery. That is how many people have benefited from these boots.
This piece of equipment has become much more important after the expansive growth of the Thorn Forest near the Tyla Monastery after Medzio Diena.
It is said that this equipment used to have different magical properties. They say that different magical properties were infused after Medzio Diena because of the expansive growth of the Thorn Forest.

Lolopanthers are beings who once served Goddess Zemyna. Although most of them are human, not all of them are.
Not many records remain of those who served Goddess Zemyna in their times. But we can witness sections of the goddess' history through names such as those of a few historical places; and especially the names of weapons such as this.
In light of this situation where the only way left to meet Goddess Zemyna was to climb up the Earth Tower, it'll allow us to restore old history from the names remaining in the tower. We are also left with more opportunities to obtain some pretty powerful magical weapons.
The cost to maintain this bow is pricey, except for those who serve the Fletcher Master. People like Lydia Schaffen, the one who founded the Astral Tower.
The Quarrel Shooter Master himself had received this bow recently.
Some records go as far as calling it a small siege weapon.
 - Causes an explosion after every 10th consecutive attack.
Ores and products of the earth can transform into a powerful weapon with the connivance of the goddess.
This truly makes you proud to be under the protection of the goddess of the earth.
Some people believe that Lolopanther equipment is made without the permission of the goddess, and is simply taking advantage of her absence.
Others believe Goddess Zemyna bestowed the right to freely use any material that grows on her land. If that wasn't the case, it would be impossible to mine the materials. However, this does not mean that we have the absolute right to do what we want.
The history of the Lolopanthers is surprisingly long. Unlike other weapons, the Lolopanther Dagger dates back to before the kingdom was founded.
One legend told that Goddess Zemyna's temple itself was a pillar of the earth. The legend is now forgotten, but the staff celebrating the legend remains to this day.
Warsis Creak has succeeded in developing a new type of weapon from the Lolopanther Musket. However, it is unknown when and how this happened.
A weapon as firm as the ground, light as a feather, and strong as a rock.
The masters who deal with gunpowder regularly use it with newly designed or discovered weapons. The same can be said for this cannon. Quicktongue, however, hardly shares any new discoveries and is likely considering his military career.
Those who dare to belittle the weapons grown by the goddess are doomed to have their blood fed to her earth.
Those who worship the great goddess will receive the wisdom through one's humility. This equipment proves that this is true not only for clerics, but for wizards too.
Whoever carries this will become the master of the earth and receive its grace with every step. However, maintaining this equipment is a problem for humans in regard to cost, which is of no concern to the goddess.
Regardless of what rights the goddess of the earth may give, those who carry and use this equipment do so to their own abilities. Do you not wonder whether it possesses an even greater power?
With every new piece of equipment, the power bestowed by the goddess of the earth is imparted on it.
Users of this equipment may not realize, but designers and artisans know that obtaining the blessing of Goddess Zemyna when using leather is not as easy as it is for cloth or metal. Thanks to their effort, it shines today on the battlefield.
Compared to other leather equipment, it is more readily blessed by Goddess Zemyna since it comes into direct contact with the ground.
Some Lolopanther equipment was not also made using the power of the owner of the tower, Goddess Zemyna, but also of the invading demons. In this case, it is important to maintain balance for equipment.
Many of the efforts to take away the power of the demons and what they were targeting remains unknown. The answers lay buried in the history of the Earth Tower.
The goddess of the earth is glad to offer humans the ores forged at her hands. However, she does not look kindly on those who take her gifts for granted.
The goddess of the earth may have allowed humans to carry weapons; that does not mean she hopes they will bring war and bloodshed. There is a special reason to make use of this particular piece of equipment.
This piece of equipment helps your two legs stand firm on Goddess Zemyna's territory.
Your faith in Goddess Zemyna and your courage need to stand forever - as firm as the earth. You must stay resolute if you receive this equipment.
The grace of the goddess of the earth is in your heart; the time to show the world your bravery has come.
It is possible to focus the power of all the goddesses in an object to increase one's abilities. It is said that the first person to ever succeed in this type of magic infusion was a nun from Saalus Convent.
Among the efforts to combine holy and magic power while eliminating conflicting elements, a few objects were made that were both a success and a failure. This bracelet is an example of such paradoxical creations.
This piece of equipment will help you pierce through the demonic darkness.
This bracelet works by strenghtening the war spirit of those who wear it. It is very powerful, but it does not come without some drawbacks.

Sketis Two-Handed Sword
The reason why there are no records of umbrellas from the foundatin of the Kingdom is because they didn't find popular use until more people began living in cities. Before this time, country folk either worked under the rain or made use of cloaks to stay dry.

Tiesa Staff
This weapon is said to have been inspired by an old relic, the cane used by a saint who captured an ancient demon goddess.
Sketis Staff

No one knows how Jukopus gave this weapon its abilities. The Winterspoon family seems to know, but do not share it.
Fyrmes Necklace
The Fyrmes Necklace contains a small portion of divine power, which is the source of its greenish color. It also symbolizes the desire to never witness the end of our world as we know it.
Predji Necklace
The symbol engraved in the center is said to have evolved from an ancient rune. So much so, it is used by rune masters to teach their pupils.
Mejstra Necklace
The Mejstra Necklace was developed by a skilled master of dreams. It gives its wearer the ability to extract power from their dreams into reality.
Svijes Necklace
The Svijes Necklace features the characteristics of the Fyrmes Necklace at a more developed level. In this necklace, the divine power has altered the nature of the piece itself.
Atikha Necklace
The method use to create the first Atikha Necklace is known only in the northern regions of the Kingdom. It was merchants who discovered a way to produce them using easier to find materials.
Manosierdi Necklace
Features the phrase, "Let the voice of the Goddess enter my heart, let it become my strength," engraved in very small lettering on the back.
Lynnki Sit Necklace
The Lynnki Sit Necklace is known for imbuing its wearer with the power of its original owner, with the first owner gaining the power of the necklace's maker. Nothing is lost in this process, as the necklace merely adds the power of the previous owner to the current wearer, without taking any power away from those who come into contact with it.
Kite Moor Necklace
This necklace was discovered by a maker looking for a way to equip two items at once. Considering its accidental discovery, the effects it possesses are quite extraordinary.
Pasiutes Necklace
The body includes an engraved sentence claiming the origins of this piece in a shattered dagger owned by a goddess.
Frieno Necklace
This necklace inherited the style of those created during the Kingdom's heydays. Currently, it assumes a more modern stance on that style, although its performance is lacking compared to the original pieces.
Fyrmes Bracelet
The Fyrmes Bracelet symbolizes an eternal cycle, represented by the looped metal rings. It is also a reminder of the will of the goddesses to banish the demons and their chaos.
Predji Bracelet
According to merchant rumors, the fact that this piece possesses a single stat is the fault of a beginner's mistake.
Mejstra Bracelet
The Mejstra Bracelet symbolizes the life added to an eternal cycle. Many were the makers who devoted themselves to maintaining the symbolism in this piece.
Svijes Bracelet
According to legends, the Svijes Bracelet was first created by a wizard known to have ventured into the realm of demons. After his body was discovered, the bracelet was the only way to confirm his identity.
Atikha Bracelet
When the Atikha Bracelet was first produced, the process of joining the two semicircles that compose it was very important. Today the bracelet is made from a single piece, which makes it more dangerous but easier to craft even by inexperienced makers.
Manosierdi Bracelet
This piece represents the power obtained from allowing the voice of the goddesses to reach one's heart.
Lynnki Sit Bracelet
The Lynnki Sit Bracelet is said to store and accumulate the power of its wearer and return it when necessary. This means that, unless the wearer is in a combat situation, it will be difficult to witness the effects of this bracelet. That said, it remains to be proven whether this makes any difference to actual combat performance.
Kite Moor Bracelet
This bracelet was made to help sacrifice the last elements maintaining the wearer's life to allow them to deliver one ultimately powerful blow. It all depends on whether the wearer's resistance is higher than the enemy's.
Pasiutes Bracelet
The red gems in this bracelet symbolize the blood of the enemy. The inner surface reads, "Never fear, only fight."
Frieno Bracelet
This bracelet inherited the style popular during the Kingdom's heydays. Contrary to its delicate appearance, this piece boasts very good resistance, a characteristic which it transfers into its wearer as well.

More than protection, the attire of a gladiator is first and foremost about showmanship. A perfect armor decreases the enjoyment of the audience, which is why the Murmillo's covers only half of the body.
The cloth around the neck allows a Shinobi to cover their face when necessary. Doing so tells the adversary that they are a Shinobi without revealing their identity.
Fencers require costly, high-quality garments, as even those of humble origins are connected with the higher classes through education or war. The Hutton family has long promoted the use of official uniforms for lower-class Fencers, which resulted in the extravagant fashions of traditional Fencer clothing being all but eliminated. This helped boost the status of lower-class Fencers, and it was the first step towards popularizing the occupation.
Dragoons, often descendants of nobility, tend to dress in a slightly ostentatious fashion. This, of course, does not diminish their ability in combat.
Templars first started to wear the purple mantle as they began to separate themselves from the clergy by order of the empire. One could say the mantle is a symbol of royal authority over the church.
Lancer garments are made with a type of metallic fabric that can maintain a good degree of malleability.
Class garments are often adopted by the nobility for fashion purposes, regardless of their relation to the job. The same cannot be said for Sage clothing. Despite their trendy appearance, Sage clothes are produced with strong-smelling chemicals which, while helpful in keeping bookworms at bay, make the outfits unattractive to fashion-oriented folk.
Warlocks may not be the most popular class in the social sphere, but their presence has long been customary at all kinds of gatherings. Because of this, Warlock garments are purposely made to look appropriate for balls and formal parties.
Featherfoots originate from outside the kingdom and research on them is scarce. Because of this, little is known about the elements of their clothing.
Despite their light appearance, Rune Caster garments are made to protect the wearer against the cold, while allowing for movement in warmer weather. This is a reflection of the climate in which Rune Caster clothing is produced.
Enchanters tend to value efficiency and performance over appearance, which is why their clothing is often simple and unadorned.
Appraisers are known to be fond of comfortable clothing, although they tend to wear formal garments whenever they are required to contact with higher-class customers. This outfit is an example of that.
The thick material of Falconer clothes is resistant to the hawk's claws, while also protecting them from damage.
Cannoneer outfits were originally similar to typical blacksmith clothing. With time, however, the class gained a higher status and its attire began to look more elegant.
Today's Musketeer garb is an exact replica of the royal honor guard uniforms worn centuries ago. Curiously, the honor guard now wears a modern version of those uniforms.
The purpose of Mergen attire in its culture of origin continues to be unknown in the kingdom. So far, the Mergen Master has provided no clues to this mystery.
Chaplain clothing combines colors and elements symbolizing the goddesses to convey a sense of security to battling soldiers. Despite this, the philosophy behind Chaplain garments does not allow for their adaptation to real combat situations.
These garments are known to be highly resistant to dirt, allowing them to last for longer periods of time without washing. Not only that, they are designed for easy laundering.
Traditionally, the ornaments in Kabbalist clothing each represent a different academic achievement. However, the lack of enforcement of this custom by the current Kabbalist Master has made it so that even beginners have started to wear the ornaments freely.
The Inquisitor's stole was originally worn only in occasions of judgement. Today, with the goddesses disappeared, it is worn at all times to help propagate the Inquisitors' doctrine.
Taoist garments are reminiscent of the style based in past academic traditions.
Miko clothing reflects the traditions of its culture of origin, resulting in a visible contrast with the local fashions of the kingdom. With the emerging status of Mikos in society, their style is also likely to influence future trends in the kingdom.

Masinios is a wizard who lived in the era of King Frienel. He came up with a very unique idea, which was to combine the power of magic with machinery and this is one of the results of his application. This sword is a product near the end of his life which reflects latter days of his research.

Because magic can resolve a lot of issues with ease, there was no need for a mechanism to transfer physical forces such as gears. However, Masinios was preoccupied with the idea of transferring magical power thorough machines. Only that this two-hand sword was created in his early days of his research. But due to that fact, the magical effect from this weapon is rather quite strong.

Rumor has it all, but when this bow was revealed to the world, Lucid Winterspoon mentions that it would have been nice if Masinios had actually experienced combat as a different class and broadened his thinking. Of course, this cannot be confirmed as she rarely answers questions about people who lived in the same era as her past.

Rumor has it that many of the later wizards laughed at the fact that Masinios was not able to create an amazing production method for the crossbow where he could demonstrate the advantage of machinery. Another rumor is that Lucid Winterspoon admonished such mages that they were only entitled to say such a thing if they worked on magic theory even half as hard as Masinios and held two master seats.

This is the result of improving the mace made by Masinios himself. Due to the fact that the mace and two-handed mace are distinctly different in performance from each other, it can be seen that it was not his intention. Rather, it can be said that he felt it was okay that this performance came as a result of him trying.

Masinios was so absorbed in future machinery and could not get enough that he changed his name to Masinios. Because of this, his previous name was forever buried in the darkness of history, never to be known. However, the Masinios Spear is made by the recipe he designed before his renaming, so his name can be traced through the magical power left in the recipe. Since Masinios is not such a popular person from the past, no one has tried so far.

There are conflicting reasons as to why Masinios as a wizard decided to devote himself to machines, but one theory is that this was due to the penultimate wizard, Agailla Flurry. It is said that he was attracted to the machine within the very Mage Tower she created.  This rapier is said to be crafted during the period of time when Masinios favored magic and considered machinery as just an addition.

It is of common opinion to say that the gears, including the gears in the Mage Tower, are not devices that use magic, but rather a device that draws a certain power and collects it in the tower. Masinios misunderstood this point and immersed himself in machinery, so the weapons he invented could have been much better, but they are not. This is also true of the cannon.

It is said that this equipment was named after Demon Lord "Ausura" who was created by Gesti herself, but it seems this is just mere coincidence.

Some speculate that goddesses like Austeja are for the preservation of dragons as a means to provide some kind of security for humans in the future. Teliavelis, on the other hand, believes that it is simply a proof of the goddesses' respect for all living creatures.
Velcoffer Rod
It is said that those who are spiritually sensitive can discern the energy of both goddesses and dragons in this weapon. The combination of such contrasting powers remains forever unfamiliar to those who experience it.
Velcoffer Bow
Many artisans believe they can produce Velcoffer equipment from regular materials. However, Teliavelis has shown that it takes a talented blacksmith to be able to handle materials containing the power of the goddesses.

 - All Quarrel Shooter skill levels {img green_up_arrow 16 16}2{nl}  - Running Shot skill level {img green_up_arrow 16 16}1
Velcoffer Crossbow
This weapon is produced with real dragon scales, although one knows for sure how Teliavelis obtains them.
Velcoffer Mace
Teliavelis is the only blacksmith known to have mastered the technique required to quickly solidify metal components. Some believe he uses the intense cooling properties of dragons when casting the metal.
Velcoffer Two-handed Mace
Although its handle is made of metal, this weapon produces no unwanted vibration when hitting the target. You could say that it is proof of Teliavelis' extraordinary talent.
Velcoffer Shield
According to a recently uncovered Exorcist report, after its design was initially revealed, this shield caught the attention of several high-ranking demons. Realistically, of course, it is highly unlikely that any of them will ever possess one. 
Velcoffer Spear
Some artisans and wizards suspect that Teliavelis may have gotten the Velcoffer Spear and Pike designs confused when crafting this weapon. The difference is merely visual, however, as it doesn't affect the weapons' performance.
 - Deals {img green_up_arrow 16 16}235 additional damage when using [Impaler]
Velcoffer Pike
The ornaments may resemble a pair of wings, but this weapon is not intended to be thrown over long distances.
Velcoffer Dagger
Some believe that the blade is made not from metal, but dragon bone. Unfortunately, dragon bones are a rare material, making this claim almost impossible to confirm.
 - 20% chance of dealing additional Fire property damage equal to 33% of your character level for 10 sec when using Hell Breath.
Velcoffer Staff
Teliavelis hopes this weapon will once become a symbol of victory over the dragons for humans and goddesses.
Velcoffer Pistol
After the reappearance of dragons, Flint Winterwood is said to be researching new ways to create stronger, heat-resistant weapons by using dragon materials.
Velcoffer Rapier
Despite its design, this sword provides decent protection to both hands and wrists. Some users, however, say that holding it can feel like touching the inside of a dragon's mouth.
Velcoffer Cannon
Recently, the Cannoneer Master has announced her opposition to the use of this weapon for military purposes. She firmly believes that the Royal Army should not mass-produce rare weapons like this one. 
 - [Covering Fire] skill level {img green_up_arrow 16 16} 1
Velcoffer Musket
Experts who have used this weapon tend to have a good impression of it. Its only flaw, they say, is that it can be hard to clean without getting injured. Fortunately, at least, it doesn't seem to backfire any sparks when used.
Velcoffer Robe
Surprisingly, the Velcoffer Robe is the most difficult piece to produce out of the entire Velcoffer gear series. This is because the robe is made from very delicate materials.
Velcoffer Leather Armor
Many believe, mistakenly, that Velcoffer equipment is made with dragon leather. While it is true that Teliavelis uses dragon materials in his gear, this piece does not include any dragon leather components.
Velcoffer Plate Armor
One legend says that Froster Lord used the power of Giltine to freeze over the world of the dragons a long time ago. Such strong magic can only be undone if Giltine herself allows her powers to be used again. 
Velcoffer Pants
Some say that Teliavelis has several ideas ready for future gear series, ideas no one has ever thought of before. Apparently, he is just waiting for the right time to reveal them.
Velcoffer Leather Pants
According to Teliavelis, after Medzio Diena the magic used to enhance equipment items has been irreversibly changed. Therefore, in his gear he prefers to focus on the performance, leaving the magic components open to more diverse setups.
Velcoffer Plate Pants
According to legends, the most powerful dragons are still alive in the dragon world. As long as their realm is dominated by the Froster Lord, however, the dragons will remain trapped there, unable to escape. 
Sausis Leather Boots
Although they maintain their traditional style to this day, the original Sausis boots were unimaginably faster.
Velcoffer Boots
One legend says that Velcoffer originally worked as a guard for an even stronger dragon. Whether that was true or not, the dragon he was said to work for is no longer alive.
Velcoffer Leather Boots
A few Class Masters believe that, if Teliavelis was involved in producing equipment for the goddesses, that could constitute proof that he is part of the Amzinas. The other Amzinas, however, have never confirmed whether that is true or simply a rumor.
Velcoffer Greaves
No one knows for sure if there are other dragons besides Boruta and Velcoffer roaming our world, but the possibility is there. Especially after Medzio Diena, these creatures have had more opportunities than ever to escape their confinement.
Velcoffer Gloves
While many consider Teliavelis a great craftsman, some believe that there is something more to his originality. It is thought that his pieces were designed with the wisdom of the goddesses, and that he is merely their maker and conveyer.
Velcoffer Leather Gloves
Sometimes, finished pieces of Velcoffer gear are found in our world. Strangely enough, they don't seem to have been made by humans, which has led magic Class Masters to assume that the goddesses possessed the original versions of Teliavelis' items.
Velcoffer Plate Gauntlets
Legends tell that one powerful dragon named Boruta crossed over to our world a long time ago. They say that, compared to him, Velcoffer is still a relatively young dragon.

Varpas Necklace
Considering that this necklace can drop from defeated demons, one would think that it does not distinguish between the good and bad nature of the wearer. On the other hand, it could also mean that the necklace is likely to betray its lawful owner.
Verijo Necklace
There is a strong possibility that Demon Goddess Ragana is connected to this piece. She is said to belong to a trinity of demon deities.

Wastrel Zvaigzde Sword
 - 10% chance per Strike attack to increase Critical Rate by 2x for 5 sec
The Wastrel itself has no interest in artifacts returned from the past. It's the powerful magic accumulated in its body that attracts old artifacts and even connects them to it. 
Asio Sword
{nl} {nl}Sharp Blade{nl} - Critical attacks delivered with a One-handed Sword apply a buff that increases critical attack by +250 for 10 sec{nl} {nl}- While Sharp Blade is active, every critical attack increases your critical attack values by an additional +80{nl}(Max. increase: 400)
This piece of equipment disappeared with the accident of Nicopolis, but it returned to our world around the same time as the Asiomage and the Quipmage. 
Wastrel Zvaigzde Two-handed Sword
 - Increases movement speed while Cyclone is active
Ancient artifacts attracted by the Wastrel are known to interact with the monster's peculiar magic. One cannot tell what new kinds of magic may arise from those interactions.
Asio Two-handed Sword
The Quipmage was always interested in expanding his influence. To achieve this, he had plans to recruit mercenaries and provide them with weapons that could surpass the power of those used by the Royal Army.
  - 1% chance to reduce an enemy's magic defense by 50% of your own magic defense and {img green_up_arrow 16 16} increase physical defense for 30 seconds with a basic attack (Does not apply to boss monsters)
Asio Rod
The Asiomage is notably fond of this weapon, as it provides an increase in intelligence. More than a tool, it serves as a sort of mood-boosting toy to the monster. 
Wastrel Zvaigzde Rod
A long time ago, a wizard created a giant lock and key, and with that they produced this weapon. Despite its appearance, however, it's often used as a cane for walking.
Wastrel Zvaigzde Bow
All the equipment that disappeared during the accident of Nicopolis has returned in the exact same conditions, without any signs of the time that has passed. 
Asio Bow
{nl} {nl}Animal Friend: Rabbit{nl} - Skill attacks grant a 10% chance of summoning a rabbit, which applies one of two buffs.{nl} {nl} - Smiley Bunny: Critical Rate +20 per stack for 10 sec, triggers Angry Bunny after 3 stacks.{nl} - Angry Bunny: AoE Attack Ratio +2, final buff applied by rabbit (duration 15 sec).
The Asiomage is carrying out research to improve the equipment originally developed by his other self, the Quipmage. This item, for example, is already more effective than when it first returned to our world.
Wastrel Zvaigzde Crossbow
All Nicopolis equipment has returned to our world in the exact same conditions as when it disappeared, from its basic components down to the coatings of oil, now centuries old.
Asio Crossbow
The Asiomage is not fond of this weapon. He still remembers being used as a living bullseye in past experiments, particularly for crossbows.
Wastrel Zvaigzde Mace
Some wizards of old Nicopolis were secretly opposed to the Kingdom, but in order to feign support, they developed a few weapons that make use of divine power. This is one of such weapons.
Asio Mace
{nl} {nl}Summon Shaman Doll{nl}  - One-handed Blunt weapon attacks grant a 10% chance of summoning a shaman doll (duration 5 sec, max. 1 doll).{nl} {nl}  - Destroy the doll to deal damage all around in proportion to its HP.{nl}  (Shaman doll HP: 30,000-50,000)
Some scientists complain that the name of this item is arbitrary, as it bears no resemblance to owls whatsoever.
Wastrel Zvaigzde Two-handed Mace
Some of the items attracted by the Wastrel's bodily magic are actually harmful to it. Otherwise, the Wastrel would be even more powerful than it is now.
Asio Two-handed Mace
 - Demolition skill level {img green_up_arrow 16 16}2{nl}  - God Smash skill level {img green_up_arrow 16 16}2
This weapon is said to have been intended for an army of Golem monsters. It is unknown whether the Quipmage or the Asiomage have any memory of that fact.
Wastrel Zvaigzde Shield
 - Final Block Rate {img green_up_arrow 16 16}2%{nl}  -  5% chance of resisting rank 2 or lower status ailments
Fortunately for everyone, the Wastrel does not use this shield for protection. However, the shield is said to ease the pain of generating new equipment items.
Asio Shield
 - Final Block Rate {img green_up_arrow 16 16}2%{nl} {nl} Eye of the Asiomage{nl} - Provocation targets {img green_up_arrow 16 16}1
Unlike other Asio items, this one faithfully represents the style and conventions popular in old Nicopolis before the great accident.
Wastrel Zvaigzde Spear
Most items that contain magic gems have negative effects on the Wastrel's body. That can be considered a fortunate occurrence.
Asio Spear
A spear designed by a wizard. The Quipmage doesn't seem to have thought that the shape of this weapon would pose any problem.
Wastrel Zvaigzde Pike
Of all the items attracted by the Wastrel, some are incorporated physically, while some have only their magic properties absorbed. Physically assimilated objects are thought to be constantly prodding the body of the Wastrel.
Asio Pike
The Asiomage is missing crucial memories about his line of equipment, while the Quipmage wonders why he remembers such useless information. This is thought to be the reason why there is still no upgraded version of the Asio Pike. 
Wastrel Zvaigzde Dagger

This item is thought to flow in the veins of the Wastrel. Although the monster's blood and circulatory system are very different from that of most living beings, it still seems to cause the Wastrel pain when it passes through certain regions of its body.
Asio Dagger
 - Dagger attacks in stealth mode increase damage by 15%
The Quipmage intended to use this weapon to assassinate the Pervading Queen and the Teal Specter. All three of these wizards had plans to annihilate the others, each through their own methods. 
Wastrel Zvaigzde Staff
In the early days of this weapon, it was common for it to break down into three pieces. Large amounts of magic were used to increase its durability, so much so that, now, it will not break even when it is fused into the Wastrel.
Asio Staff
Unlike the Asio Rod, the Asio Staff is known to bring down the spirits of the Asiomage. The intelligence boost causes him to relive even more memories of his turbulent past.
Wastrel Zvaigzde Pistol
 - Full Metal Jacket skill level {img green_up_arrow 16 16}2{nl}  - Retreat Shot skill level {img green_up_arrow 16 16}2
Due to the gap created by Medzio Diena, the Wastrel's living quarters have begun to attract common items found in the present. This means that the Wastrel is not only surrounded by weapons like this pistol, but also by miscellaneous items like worn-out shoes and broken chairs.
Asio Pistol
{nl} {nl}Target Set{nl} - Pistol attacks grant a 20% chance of applying the Target Set debuff.{nl} {nl} - Target Set deals 5,000-7,000 damage to 10 nearby enemies when it reaches 3 stacks.{nl} {nl} - Damage increased by 30% per nearby enemy affected by Target Set (max. increase: 700%).
The Asiomage is quite proud of this weapon. He began designing his own gunpowder weapons after returning to our world. 
Wastrel Zvaigzde Rapier
Weapons like these with low slashing power can easily end up lodged in the Wastrel's body. Fortunately for the Wastrel, however, they do not cause him pain.
Asio Rapier
 - Epee Garde skill level {img green_up_arrow 16 16}2
Although the original designer of this weapon was the Pervading Queen, the Asiomage is the one currently developing it. The Pervading Queen has long lost interest in the production of equipment.

Wastrel Zvaigzde Cannon
 - Attacks in Bazooka status grant a 10% chance of applying the same damage as the previous attack.
Seeing as so many weapons are absorbed into the Wastrel's body, one would think at least some of them would be deployed inside of it.
Asio Cannon
 - Sweeping Cannon skill level {img green_up_arrow 16 16}2{nl}  - Siege Burst skill level {img green_up_arrow 16 16}2
The Asiomage was heavily influenced by the excessive scholarly fervor that is typical of wizards, which led him to create unnecessary weapons for no apparent reason.
Wastrel Zvaigzde Musket
This weapon was not absorbed into the Wastrel's body by traveling through the gap that appeared during Medzio Diena. It is said to have been carried by an adventurer who attempted to defeat the Wastrel.
Asio Musket
After returning to our world and learning that many bird species had mutated into monsters, the Asiomage made plans to create his own army of birds to carry this weapon. A rather birdish thought, one might say.

Ignas Robe
 - Triggers the Ignas - Immunity buff when equipped{nl} {nl}Ignas - Immunity{nl} - Grants a (2.5 * Ignas - Immunity stacks)% chance of resisting debuffs of Lv 2 and below.
It is hard to tell what methods Ignas used to craft this item from the essence of Ziburynas. If he was able to harness the full power of the essence, he certainly would have created much stronger equipment.
Ignas Leather Armor
 - Activates the Jab buff when equipped{nl} {nl}Jab{nl} - Triggers Ignas - Jab when you attack in stealth mode.{nl} {nl} Ignas - Jab{nl} - Increases physical and magic critical attack by (300 * Jab stacks). (10 sec duration)
No one knows exactly why Ignas produced different pieces of equipment from such varied materials. Some believe he intended to target enemies other than the Resistance.
Ignas Plate Armor
 - Activates the Wrath buff when equipped{nl} {nl}Wrath{nl} - Grants a (5 * Wrath stacks)% chance of triggering Ignas - Wrath whenever you are attacked. {nl} {nl}Ignas - Wrath{nl} - Maximum attack + 250 (max. 3 stacks, 10 sec duration)
Given how the Astral Tower is located in the middle of a lake, the likelihood of a surprise attack is significantly low. One wonders, then, what Ignas' intentions were behind the making of this plate armor.
Ignas Pants
 - Triggers the Ignas - Immunity buff when equipped{nl} {nl}Ignas - Immunity{nl} - Grants a (2.5 * Ignas - Immunity stacks)% chance of resisting debuffs of Lv 2 and below.
One could assume that Ignas only possessed a limited amount of the Essence of Ziburynas, seeing as how he used fairly little of it on his line of equipment.  
Ignas Leather Pants
Were it not for production constraints, a full Schaffenstar army equipped with Ignas' items would become the strongest in the Kingdom. One could even argue that would be enough to defeat any other armed forces in the nation 4-to-1.
Ignas Plate Pants
When he created these pants, Ignas mentioned that they were designed as testing equipment for Schwarzer Reiters and other mercenaries from the Astral Tower.
Ignas Boots
 - Activates the Tactics buff when equipped{nl} {nl}Tactics{nl} - Triggers Ignas - Tactics with every critical attack.{nl} {nl}Ignas - Tactics{nl} - Increases magical critical attack by (125 * Tactics stacks){nl}(Max. 2 stacks, 10 sec duration)
The Astral Tower includes flooring of many types, including wire mesh floors. These boots were created to protect the wearer's feet from all kinds of floor materials.
Ignas Leather Boots
 - Activates the Scrutiny buff when equipped{nl} {nl}Scrutiny{nl} - Triggers Ignas - Scrutiny with every successful evasion.{nl} {nl}Ignas - Scrutiny{nl} - Increases critical rate by (70 * Scrutiny stacks). (10 sec duration)
Some pieces are said to contain the inscription, "Schaffenstar under the stars, the world under Schaffenstar." 
Ignas Greaves
 - Activates the Fortitude buff when equipped{nl} {nl}Fortitude{nl} - (5 * Fortitude stacks)% chance to trigger Ignas - Fortitude on successful block.{nl} {nl}Ignas - Fortitude{nl} - Physical and magic defense +300{nl}(Maximum of 5 stacks for 10 sec duration)
According to Elder Ramunas' experiments, extracting the Essence of Ziburynas from Ignas' equipment is not as easy as it may seem. He believes, however, that a magic Class Master may be able to achieve just that one day.
Ignas Gloves
Looking at how each piece of Ignas' equipment is adorned with Schaffenstar symbols, one can assume that these would be the items used by its members, had he remained as head of the organization. 
Ignas Leather Gloves
According to reports from his early career, Ignas predicted that any act of treason within the Schaffenstar would be met with three obstacles: Lydia Schaffen's provisions, the Three-Layered Castle Wall, and Class Master neutrality. These gloves, however, provide a clue as to which Master he foresaw as an ally. 
Ignas Plate Gauntlets
The claws in these gauntlets are useful not just in combat situations, but also in the daily life of Schaffenstar members, especially when it comes to cleaning the external walls of the Astral Tower.
 - Increases magic critical attack by a value equal to {img green_up_arrow 16 16}40% of your HP recovery rate at the time of equipping this item{nl} - Reduces HP recovery rate to 0
Drakonas Lynnki Sit Necklace
A different magic object was used to alter the nature of these jewels, and the resulting magic power was then spread throughout the rest of the ornaments.

[Event] Wastrel Zvaigzde Sword
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}The Wastrel itself has no interest in artifacts returned from the past. It's the powerful magic accumulated in its body that attracts old artifacts and even connects them to it.  
[Event] Wastrel Zvaigzde Two-handed Sword
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}Ancient artifacts attracted by the Wastrel are known to interact with the monster's peculiar magic. One cannot tell what new kinds of magic may arise from those interactions.
[Event] Wastrel Zvaigzde Rod
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}A long time ago, a wizard created a giant lock and key, and with that they produced this weapon. Despite its appearance, however, it's often used as a cane for walking.
[Event] Wastrel Zvaigzde Bow
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}All the equipment that disappeared during the accident of Nicopolis has returned in the exact same conditions, without any signs of the time that has passed. 
[Event] Wastrel Zvaigzde Crossbow
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}All Nicopolis equipment has returned to our world in the exact same conditions as when it disappeared, from its basic components down to the coatings of oil, now centuries old.
[Event] Wastrel Zvaigzde Mace
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}Some wizards of old Nicopolis were secretly opposed to the Kingdom, but in order to feign support, they developed a few weapons that make use of divine power. This is one of such weapons.
[Event] Wastrel Zvaigzde Two-handed Mace
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}Some of the items attracted by the Wastrel's bodily magic are actually harmful to it. Otherwise, the Wastrel would be even more powerful than it is now.
[Event] Wastrel Zvaigzde Shield
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}Fortunately for everyone, the Wastrel does not use this shield for protection. However, the shield is said to ease the pain of generating new equipment items.
[Event] Wastrel Zvaigzde Spear
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}Most items that contain magic gems have negative effects on the Wastrel's body. That can be considered a fortunate occurrence.
[Event] Wastrel Zvaigzde Pike
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}Of all the items attracted by the Wastrel, some are incorporated physically, while some have only their magic properties absorbed. Physically assimilated objects are thought to be constantly prodding the body of the Wastrel.
[Event] Wastrel Zvaigzde Dagger
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}This item is thought to flow in the veins of the Wastrel. Although the monster's blood and circulatory system are very different from that of most living beings, it still seems to cause the Wastrel pain when it passes through certain regions of its body.
[Event] Wastrel Zvaigzde Staff
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}In the early days of this weapon, it was common for it to break down into three pieces. Large amounts of magic were used to increase its durability, so much so that, now, it will not break even when it is fused into the Wastrel.
[Event] Wastrel Zvaigzde Pistol
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}Due to the gap created by Medzio Diena, the Wastrel's living quarters have begun to attract common items found in the present. This means that the Wastrel is not only surrounded by weapons like this pistol, but also by miscellaneous items like worn-out shoes and broken chairs.
[Event] Wastrel Zvaigzde Rapier
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}Weapons like these with low slashing power can easily end up lodged in the Wastrel's body. Fortunately for the Wastrel, however, they do not cause him pain.
[Event] Wastrel Zvaigzde Cannon
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}Seeing as so many weapons are absorbed into the Wastrel's body, one would think at least some of them would be deployed inside of it.
[Event] Wastrel Zvaigzde Musket
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}This weapon was not absorbed into the Wastrel's body by traveling through the gap that appeared during Medzio Diena. It is said to have been carried by an adventurer who attempted to defeat the Wastrel.
[Event] Asio Sword
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}This piece of equipment disappeared with the accident of Nicopolis, but it returned to our world around the same time as the Asiomage and the Quipmage.  
[Event] Asio Two-handed Sword
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}The Quipmage was always interested in expanding his influence. To achieve this, he had plans to recruit mercenaries and provide them with weapons that could surpass the power of those used by the Royal Army.
[Event] Asio Rod
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}The Asiomage is notably fond of this weapon, as it provides an increase in intelligence. More than a tool, it serves as a sort of mood-boosting toy to the monster. 
[Event] Asio Bow
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}The Asiomage is carrying out research to improve the equipment originally developed by his other self, the Quipmage. This item, for example, is already more effective than when it first returned to our world.
[Event] Asio Crossbow
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}The Asiomage is not fond of this weapon. He still remembers being used as a living bullseye in past experiments, particularly for crossbows.
[Event] Asio Mace
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}Some scientists complain that the name of this item is arbitrary, as it bears no resemblance to owls whatsoever.
[Event] Asio Two-handed Mace
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}This weapon is said to have been intended for an army of Golem monsters. It is unknown whether the Quipmage or the Asiomage have any memory of that fact.
[Event] Asio Shield
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}Unlike other Asio items, this one faithfully represents the style and conventions popular in old Nicopolis before the great accident.
[Event] Asio Spear
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}A spear designed by a wizard. The Quipmage doesn't seem to have thought that the shape of this weapon would pose any problem.
[Event] Asio Pike
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}The Asiomage is missing crucial memories about his line of equipment, while the Quipmage wonders why he remembers such useless information. This is thought to be the reason why there is still no upgraded version of the Asio Pike. 
[Event] Asio Dagger
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}The Quipmage intended to use this weapon to assassinate the Pervading Queen and the Teal Specter. All three of these wizards had plans to annihilate the others, each through their own methods.  
[Event] Asio Staff
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}Unlike the Asio Rod, the Asio Staff is known to bring down the spirits of the Asiomage. The intelligence boost causes him to relive even more memories of his turbulent past.
[Event] Asio Pistol
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}The Asiomage is quite proud of this weapon. He began designing his own gunpowder weapons after returning to our world.  
[Event] Asio Rapier
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}Although the original designer of this weapon was the Pervading Queen, the Asiomage is the one currently developing it. The Pervading Queen has long lost interest in the production of equipment.
[Event] Asio Cannon
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}The Asiomage was heavily influenced by the excessive scholarly fervor that is typical of wizards, which led him to create unnecessary weapons for no apparent reason.
[Event] Asio Musket
Event item; does not allow for Ichor extraction.{nl}After returning to our world and learning that many bird species had mutated into monsters, the Asiomage made plans to create his own army of birds to carry this weapon. A rather birdish thought, one might say.
