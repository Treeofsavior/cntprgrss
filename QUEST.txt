Bokor Master
So you are curious about this stone slate. {nl}If you wish, I shall show you the will of its creator.
Goddess Laima
By the time you get this message, much time will have passed. {nl}I am Laima, the goddess of fate and wisdom.
600 years ago while creating this revelation, I foresaw a great deal of death and suffering. {nl}If you are seeing this, then I am afraid what I foresaw has come to pass.
The demons have started the first of the cataclysms, and the goddesses have vanished. {nl}I knew all of this would occur and did everything I could to prevent this fate, but my power was not enough.
Instead, I wandered through far-seeing dreams for an answer. {nl}You were at the end of them... a Savior.
Unfortunately, the demons could not stay still, knowing that I possess strength in clairvoyance. {nl}I was forced to hide until the time of your appearance.
I decided to divide my being and remain within many revelations. {nl} Revelations that I continued to create secretly over a millennium.
Savior, if you can help me regain my form, we can stop the demons' sinister plans.{nl}You must recover the revelations that I have hidden throughout every axis of time.
This divine task may be a heavy burden, but it is something you must bear. {nl}Perhaps in the muddy midst of your trials and tribulations, something may come about.
Nevertheless, only we can save this world.
I have passed the next revelation to the first Paladin. {nl}He will be waiting for you at the highest flower garden.
The dark aura is indeed unpleasant... {nl}But if this message is truly from the Goddess Laima, then I am simply in awe.
Well, you should hurry and go find Sir Uska. {nl}He will tell you where to go next. {nl}May the goddess bless your fate...

The fee's 100 silver. {nl}It's cheaper than cutting through monster central.
Cyneburg
That'll be 100 silver coins. {nl}That'll cover operations, labor, and other expenses.
Hey, wait a minute. {nl}You know you need more than that...
That's no good! {nl}I can't work for nothing, even for a Revelator.
Wandering Merchant
Like a dandelion's seeds, I am merely one who follows the wind. {nl}Since we've met in such a curious way, perhaps you could spare a moment to view my curiosities?
Cristina
Welcome! {nl}You're looking for a travel companion, right? {nl}You won't find a better place for partners than here!
You can make your companions watch you fight or train special attributes. {nl}Earn enough affection, and you can even buy some cool equipment!
Raising your companion's affection will increase riding stamina and evasion! {nl}So what do you think? Is that enough to make you consider one?

Knight Titas
If so, go see Knight Commander Uska in Klaipeda. {nl}But first, I have an important errand I would like to run by you, so follow me.
It would be nice if I could find a moment to relax...
Sparnas... {nl}is not someone to take lightly...
Soldier Moody
Let's deal with this monster before talking.
Joint Investigation Team - Scott
I long for a time when our team is no longer needed... {nl}What a peaceful age that would be...
I don't know where to start. {nl}Have you heard anything?
By royal orders, we've come to this forest to investigate some strange events. {nl}Witnesses have reported something with a big face and bony fingers. {nl}What in the world could that be?
In the past, pilgrims traveled through this forest. {nl}But now due to the presence of monsters, only soldiers gather here.
Up until four years ago, the goddesses often blessed us with signs of their presence. {nl}But now, even our combined prayers don't bring so much as a tremor. {nl}Have they truly abandoned us?
Vacenin personally goes to each region to deal with things. {nl}He gets uncomfortable when he stays in the city.
Do you plan on staying or enlisting? {nl}If you're interested, I'll gladly recommend you to the head commanders.
Don't let your guard down. {nl}Monsters can appear any time, anywhere.
Where in the world did Goddess Zemyna go...
What in the world do you call this?
I think Zemyna, the goddess of the earth would grieve more than anyone else.
The Pokubu have always been here, but sometimes unfamiliar monsters are spotted as well.
I've thought about it. There's no doubt that the goddesses have abandoned us all. {nl}If that weren't so, then there wouldn't be so many monsters.
They say there's a man blessed with the goddess' strength living in the forest.
I want to go home.
The number of monsters here doesn't seem to change no matter how many of them we kill.
Did Julian send you off, Revelator?
I'm amazed. {nl}You're the first person I've met here in several years.
I'll show you what I saw.
Please, forget about me and just leave. {nl}The flowers seem to be coming along beautifully.
Lena
Please, tell me your life story. {nl}We follow the will of Vaivora and record all that is in this world.
Henrika
Hello! {nl}Welcome to the Klaipeda branch of the Magic Association. {nl}We specialize in studying the strange phenomena that occur when special items are combined.
There's nothing to see here but steam and Vubbes. {nl}Wait, what's that thing with the big face that's approaching?!
The land needs our attention as well. {nl}The world still isn't ruined... right?
If we continue to have courtesy, then we still know the way of a righteous life. {nl}We should all consider whether or not this mess is our fault because we relied on the goddesses for everything.
Bulletin Board
Welcome to the mining town of Klaipeda!
Indifferent Widow
I'm not sure I understand it completely, but what I'm sure of is that the goddesses didn't disappear all at once.
The first to disappear was the Goddess Gabija. {nl}I heard it was a very long time ago. {nl}One by one, starting with Gabija, they stopped replying.
Goddess Vakarine left us shortly before Medzio Diena. {nl}Both Zemyna and Ausrine disappeared soon after. {nl}It's already been four years since.
That's right. The strangest one of all was the Goddess Laima. {nl}No one's really sure when she disappeared.
Besides, isn't Laima the goddess of fate and foresight? {nl}She probably knew all about it.
Resting Soldier
I used to be an adventurer like you. Then I took an arrow in the knee...
It doesn't matter. Come and face me, you monsters!
A goddess appeared in my dream just now... {nl}She was so enchanting...
Still, I have a duty to defend the kingdom. That's why I'm here.
Uska is an old friend of mine.
We did our tests to become knights together. Uska got to where he is now with my sincere support. {nl}Oh, those were some crazy days... It'd be nice to see him again.
Just don't believe everything he says. {nl}He was known for being quite the show-off back home.
Me? I find it funny, so I just leave him alone.
Uh, wait. I take back what I said about not believing everything he says.
Everything that flies out of his mouth is a lie. Don't trust him.
Siauliai Guard
There are monsters beyond this point. Be careful.
These woods aren't exactly peaceful, but it's better than other places. {nl}There are forests that have nothing but souls roaming about.
This is what people who have seen a goddess in their dreams are being called.
I thought the Revelators' visions were madness at first. {nl}After all, the goddesses have been gone for a long time.
Isn't it true that the goddesses haven't responded to any of our prayers since Medzio Diena{nl}four years ago?
You can find Class Masters all around the kingdom. {nl}Why don't you visit them and learn what you can?
You don't know about Medzio Diena? You must have come from really far away. {nl}Four years ago, things went out of control at the capital.
It was a disaster... Many people were either injured or killed. {nl}Once gentle creatures turned fierce and many new monsters emerged.
If you are still interested about what happened on Medzio Diena four years ago,{nl}try visiting Klaipeda.
Eastern Woods Sentinel
Are you heading to the Eastern Woods? {nl}You mustn't! It's far too dangerous!
Damn, those stubborn things chased us this far!
Those screams... We're under attack!
Safety Instructions
1. Only authorized personnel may enter. {nl}2. Always follow the directions of the mining supervisor.
3. Do not approach closed-off areas. {nl}4. Any suspicious individuals should be reported to the knights of Klaipeda.
Supply Base Soldier
I've never been in a real fight before so I'm a bit nervous.
Farm Sentinel
My colleague is in the middle of a battle at the Miners' Village. {nl}I've thought of going to help, but the Eastern Woods is in trouble as well, so all I can do is worry.
I think this mission has shown me enough monsters for a lifetime. {nl}It used to be just groups of Vubbes.
Chupacabras are fond of the streams and lush vegetation of the northern area.
Klaipeda Guard Captain
You're the...
It looks like you can see into the upper forest from here. {nl}Try not to get into trouble.
You don't have the required quest item. Are you sure you want to continue?
Klaipeda Girl
My neighbor used to be a monster hunter. {nl}He's retired now though. It has gotten extremely dangerous.
It would be nice if all these Revelators being here meant that the goddesses are back.
It might be silly to hope for the goddess' return, but it's better than nothing.
Klaipeda Lady
We can still grow from the land, and have a warm hearth at our homes to rest at. {nl}I will always believe the goddesses are somewhere in the world.
Keep faith. {nl}The goddesses may still send a Savior to us.
Hoplite Master
If the sword is a symbol of power, then the spear is that of pure destruction. {nl}Power or destruction - what would you reach for on the battlefield?
Machine Worker
Even with the world as chaotic as it is, we can't stop working. {nl}It's been four years. Isn't it time to make peace with the past and start over?
Klaipeda is a town that lives off its mining. {nl}With Medzio Diena, we ought to work on planting trees or cutting them.
My old man did this thing where he checked around corners for anything nice. {nl}Sometimes, he'd get lucky and find a nice treasure chest. I wonder who leaves them there.
Retired Hunter
I remember this battle in a deep canyon where soldiers fought a huge monster. {nl}Seeing the giant thing fall was amazing, but what was more amazing were the spoils.
Old Potter
I put a prayer on my earthenware, one by one. {nl}That way, the pots will one day be filled with the goddess' blessings.
Swordsmen should have Strength, but you can also have Dexterity and Constitution. {nl}You'll need to think about what to start with.
Wizards work with Intelligence, but shouldn't forget Spirit for more spell-casting. {nl}You'll have to choose between being balanced or specialized.
Archers should have Strength, but Dexterity will prevent problems with movement. {nl}You'll need to think about what to start with.
Clerics work with Intelligence, but might need a lot of Strength or Spirit. {nl}You should really decide what you want first.
Doppelsoeldner Master
Worthwhile things always carry a degree of risk. {nl}Naturally, for big rewards, you'll have to put up with lots of danger.

Magical Research Material

Hiding and sneaking won't solve all your problems. {nl}A true Scout must also be ready to fight.
You're gonna need a lot of things when traveling. {nl}Be sure to stock up your provisions in advance.
If the control magic is dispelled, the divine messages won't be protected.
Forgotten Thief's Monument
I, Zubeck, leave this epitaph. {nl}For the honor of being the greatest thief in history, I challenged a powerful sorcerer.
But could I, a mere thief, claim victory by merely stealing from her? {nl}Perhaps, if I could rob the greatest archmage blind.
Yet, I couldn't. {nl}I wanted to be the number one thief in all of history, not just today.
I have at last discovered a way to enter the Mage Tower. {nl}To do so one has to concentrate magic power at a specific place. {nl}Now, I only need take one more decisive step.
Then, my special device will activate. {nl}If you do as I did, you will be able to enter the tower as well.
After that, you too can show those dumb magicians a thing or two. Haha!
Commanding Monument
The thieves who entered this tower were burned alive. {nl}I leave this monument as a warning to other trespassers. {nl}- Agailla Flurry
Demon Queen Gesti
Insolent humans.
Just you wait. This isn't the end. {nl}Pray with your heart that Laima will save this world.

Follower Algis
The moment that the goddess foretold to the first Paladin has finally arrived. {nl}Come. Ask me anything.
A long, long time ago, there were nomads who suffered from a cursed plague. {nl}The honorable first Paladin removed the curse with a Holy Relic.
The Watchers are the descendants of those nomads. {nl}However, the Holy Relic was not meant for healing those people.
One day, the goddess requested the first Paladin to safeguard a divine revelation. {nl}The cursed nomads appeared just as the paladin mulled on how to keep it secret.
They and the first Paladin made three pledges before breaking the curse.
To build the Tenet Church together. {nl}To conceal the Holy Relic within these grounds and worship its holiness. {nl}To gather and fight together when danger comes close to this location.
All this, was to protect the revelation hidden in the sanctum of the Tenet Church.
The Holy Relic was originally made to protect the revelation as a bait. {nl}With it, we will lure the Demon Queen here and destroy her.
Anything can happen though. {nl}If the plan fails, then the final battle will likely happen in the Tenet Church.
Pawndel
What's up?
Really?
Pawnd
What happened?
Gesti told us to protect this place.
So what do I do now?
Is this the right place?
Explaining
Shared the details of the revelation fragment found in the Crystal Mine.
I don't know how great you were in the past nor do I care. {nl}In here, you follow the Royal Army's orders, even you, Knights of Kaliss. {nl}In here, our word is law!
Grave Robber Hubertas
Hanging around in these ruins is driving me insane. {nl}Why the heck did he come here anyway?
Grave Robber Benjaminas
People call us grave robbers, but we prefer to call ourselves... archaeologists, {nl}scavenging and making use of all these items no one uses anymore. {nl}It sure beats leaving them to rot, right?
A Citizen's Journal
It's been a year since the civil war broke out. Prices in town have risen dramatically. {nl}Commander Ruklys has sent for aid, to restore the town's dwindling supplies. {nl}It's been a while since we've had any good news. There's talk about King Kadumel going after the general. {nl}Mood's not going to change soon.
A Sentry's Report
The guard posts have been reinforced in response to King Kadumel's forces' movements in the country. {nl}It's been confirmed that the king commands a large army. {nl}But if General Hayatin can muster enough volunteer soldiers, the incompetent king will likely surrender or retreat.
A Trader's Log
The city is running out of food and supplies. {nl}(The rest is illegible.)
Rumor has it that Ruklys has heard about the citizens' harsh conditions {nl}and is negotiating with Kadumel for their amnesty.
An Officer's Record
Premier Eminent is in talks with Commander Ruklys. {nl}We may have to move to the Fortress of the Land and let the royal forces claim the city. {nl}It's good news for the civilians at least. Despite the town being conceded, the Fortress will not be taken as easily.
King Kadumel is keen on persecuting the townspeople. {nl}The premier is pushing Commander Ruklys to negotiate terms ensuring that the civilians are safe from enemy forces. {nl}Despite the royal forces occupying the town, there has yet to be any threatening movement.
We should wait until Kostas gets here. {nl}We have a lot to do, so it'd be nice if he gets here soon.
Cryomancer Kostas
Everything will be resolved when the Symbol of Silk is found. {nl}With it, we can revive the city.
Grave Robber Rudolfas
The Royal Army and the Knights of Kaliss... I think we've struck gold. {nl}No one's around here or calling this place home any more.
A Royal Officer's Record
There has been no progress since Ruklys' group retreated to the Fortress of the Land. {nl}The priests under Maven's direction are reluctant to fight, and the King is hiring mages by paying them a hefty sum. {nl}But we expect little to no progress at all even after their participation.
Townsperson's Document
How could this happen?! {nl}Lydia Schaffen is aiding Kadumel's forces!
Army Official's Report
Lydia Schaffen, a person I've only heard of in rumors, came to the city with her followers. {nl}The officers and soldiers expect she'll change the tide of the battle. {nl}}His Majesty ordered us to support her to the best of our ability.
Citizen's Record
The Fortress of the Land has fallen! It's all over...
Commander Ruklys has fallen in battle, and the Fortress of the Land has been taken. {nl}Some people say the commander died to Lydia Schaffen's arrow, and others say he died to the royal magicians' magic. {nl}It is indeed sad news.
To support the Knights of Kaliss, I was dispatched here from the head office. {nl}If you've any concerns, visit the headquarters in the Square of Lamentation.
The higher-ups in the Knights of Kaliss are spending a lot on this place. I'm not sure how to feel about that. {nl}To make matters worse, grave robbers are here, so we're just waiting for support.
Up until now, I've only seen the cursed figures of the fallen. Now that I'm here, that's going to change.
Will lifting this city's curse bring back the dead? {nl}I doubt it, but our lords have put great effort into retaking this area. {nl}They've done all they could for that purpose.
Grave Robber Stephonas
We're different from those other grave-robbing hooligans. {nl}They've no pride or business sense! {nl}If you help us now, we'll return the favor someday soon.
Royal Army Guard Rofdel
You can see all sorts of things happening from this watchtower even if it's as if time in the city has stopped. {nl}The dust usually gets in the way, but you can see all the way to Ruklys' paths when it rains.
We've worked for centuries to revive these ruins. {nl}With your help, we might be able to learn about that day and finally succeed.
Bokor Edita
There is definitely a curse here. I'm sure of it.
Alchemist Saliamonas
This place is truly intriguing. This city is brimming with things to study and experiment on.
Grave Robber Amanda
Our family's different from those other grave-robbing animals. {nl}We might bend a few rules to make a living, but still...
Are the soldiers already dead? {nl}I've never seen the Petrifying Frost as strange as this before. {nl}It's like everyone in the city is trying to hide something by reliving that day.

Torn Letter
To my beloved brother in Fedimian...
Gesti has sensed it. Stay calm. It is not yet time.
Off-duty Supply Trooper
I have no idea what the royal household is doing. {nl}I even heard that the nobles have already fled the town.
In times like these, it's good to craft and use your own things rather than buying stuff. {nl}I was originally a supply trooper, but that work's not much different from a blacksmith's.
Follower Norma
I was not aware that you were the one who accepted our request, Revelator. {nl}It is truly an honor.
Gesti's demons keep attacking relentlessly. {nl}Their dark influence has reached the Panto that live here.
The Panto were once docile, but now they charge and attack on sight.
There is a tree here that the Panto worship. {nl}If this is happening, that tree has almost certainly been corrupted by a dark power.
Please protect the Romuvan barrier at the top of the valley. {nl}We will take care of the rest when our brothers arrive here.
May the goddess bless you.
I want to get some action. {nl}I haven't seen a fight in a long while.
We're still preparing. {nl}Please wait a little longer.
Antares
What? You still try and disturb my experiments? {nl}I will not allow this!
Be careful! I'm sure this is Antares' work. It'll explode if you get too close. {nl}You'd better lure the monsters and remove them one at a time.
When I release this valve, my grand experiment will be complete and you'll see a most spectacular sight!
Don't interrupt me while I stabilize the Jewels of Prominence.
You still don't get it? If it weren't for Antares, I'd be spending my life as a human. {nl}That's right. I'm a demon.
Indeed... the Jewels of Prominence were hard to make, and it would be nice to see the final product for once. {nl}It's naturally my favorite, but I don't know about you. Hahaha...
Do you know about the Demon Lord, Helgasercle? {nl}I've read that she attacked the Mage Tower several times in the past.
She'll continue to grow stronger until her envy wanes. {nl}But she was defeated every time she came, so I wonder if she succeeded this time.
Look out! Behind you!
I hope this revelation will reach you under the blessings of fire... {nl} I'll begin by trying to foresee the disasters that will occur in your time.
Since the dawn of time, the World Tree has grown beneath the earth, breathing life into being. {nl}It is the root of all things.
Giltine is setting the stage for a disaster by turning the World Tree's essence upon itself.{nl}By reversing the flow of life's energy, the World Tree retakes it and grows to a tremendous scale.
The rampaging World Tree will rip through the land, bringing disaster to all. {nl}Indeed, the Divine Tree you see in your time is in fact the World Tree.
The catastrophe will not end there. {nl}You have surely seen the Tree Root Crystals.
The demons transformed them to easily consume the spirits and aid in the Tree's growth. {nl}Because of this, many new monsters will be born, armed with even greater ferocity.
When I learned of it all, my remaining strength could not cope with the great calamity. {nl}The prophecy sent to Zachariel of the capital's demise was forgotten, due to the demons' scheming.
The World Tree will continue to grow. {nl}To what end... is beyond my control.
However, I doubt the plights I saw were the limits of all that will happen. {nl}I believe the seeds of change will come from you.
I will end my long story here. The wise Maven will hold the next revelation. {nl}I quietly await for the day you reach the Great Cathedral.
Goddess Gabija
I thank you, Savior. {nl}If I had listened to Laima, I would not be regretting this day.
Thanks to you, I have regained my strength, but it has only just begun. {nl}In return, I shall lure away the demons with a false revelation at the tower.
Before that, I have something to tell you: {nl}Laima's story.
Auctioneer
It ain't easy to get the good stuff. {nl}Merchants have been rethinking their routes thanks to the monsters around Klaipeda.
The auction has started! {nl}We went through a lot of trouble to bring you these listed items. {nl}Let's start the bidding!
These are the West Siauliai Woods. {nl}We should give a certain amount away when the villagers tend to the memorials, right?
So the Thaumaturge Master sent you. {nl}One question, first. The center of Fedimian holds a statue designed after which goddess?
Here's the quiz, so listen up! {nl}What is the name of the group that Lydia Schaffen formed to retrieve the goddess' revelation?
Did you read any books in the Crystal Mine's 1st Lot, 2nd Floor? {nl}What's the name of the prisoner who wasn't able to escape after sealing Mirtis by caving in the Crystal Mine?
Take it. I don't need it any more... Ugh... {nl}After I finish this booze, I'll go look for my brother again... Heh...
What? My brother's dead? {nl}What nonsense are you talking 'bout, huh? Get outta here! *sniff*
Sensitive Owl
The owl howls...
The owl howls... It looks very sad, crying alone.
That's right. Good job!
That was close. Try your luck again.
Excellent. It's right!
No. Try again.
Good. Very good!
You got that wrong. {nl}Why don't you try again?
The place upstairs is the divine place where the gigantic Goddess Statue, the symbol of Fedimian, is located. {nl}All believers, tidy yourself and worship quietly.
Fedimian wasn't always like this... {nl}It was once a beautiful and vibrant city. {nl}Fortunately, the divine district, where the central Goddess Statue is located, is still okay.
Fedimian was originally divided into two districts, the commerce district and the divine district. {nl}But an incident four years ago left the commerce district completely destroyed and Fedimian soon changed for the worse...
Mercifully, the divine district still stands today thanks to the blessing of the goddess.
I am just an ordinary old man in Fedimian. {nl}If you want to know more, then bring me some potato dumplings...
The food at Fedimian is awful. {nl}Before I die, is it going to be possible to try all delicious food in the world?
This is the Holy District of Fedimian. {nl}May you receive the full blessings of the goddesses.
Right now, the Market District is closed for reconstruction. {nl}Please do not enter that district.
The Fedimian Holy District welcomes you.
Thank you so much for your efforts. We are going to investigate here one more time. {nl}Cheer up!
Finished already? {nl}Amazing! You'd expect nothing less from a Revelator!
It is said that if one receives too much good, he begins to believe it's his right. {nl}Maybe, we relied too much on the goddess.
Soldier Pitt
Are you the Revelator? {nl}It is such an honor to meet you!
Soldier Bran
Ever since I was a kid, it's been my dream to fight at the front lines!
Training Soldier Malt
The number of monsters are not declining even after the Revelator tried so hard...
Commander Raimondas
Many people who claim to be Revelators come here. {nl}Are you one of them?
I have met many Revelators, but I have never seen one quite like you. {nl}Well done. I hope we'll meet again someday.
Herb Broker
Do you need anything?
What you see here is not everything I have for sale. Hehe...
Instructor Nicker
If one soldier breaks a rule, then it may endanger the entire military. {nl}That's why we have to be very strict.
I guess I'll admit it now. You, the Revelator, pursue the dream of the goddess. {nl}It's not going to be easy, but I believe you'll do well.
Are you the Revelator? Good work, {nl}but I'm not quite sure I can trust you.
Private Personnel
To survive in this chaotic world, you'll sometimes need to use some dirty tricks. {nl}You shouldn't feel bad about it.
If you want to get a job done quick, then do it yourself. {nl}That's why I became a soldier.
I've heard many stories of heroes who fought for justice in my childhood, {nl}but I've always thought of them as just stories...{nl}Now I think heroes may exist.
York
The goddess may have abandoned us, but we feel safe with the Revelator here with us.
I want to go back to my hometown... {nl}I can't wait for supplies any longer. {nl}There's also no end in sight for this situation. *sigh*
There are moments that I just want to go out without the uniform and the boots. {nl}I only do this for my family's safety.
I am not a poet myself so I can't say it for sure... but you seem different. {nl}Anyway, I hope I can hear about you even if you are far away.
Street Vendor
We have everything here. {nl}But as you can see, we are temporarily closed.

Which way do you choose?

That's unfortunate.

A dewdrop slipped and fell down to the ground.
Naktis and his followers will probably looking for clues to enter the Great Cathedral.
Naktis is loyal to Gesti and will do anything to be recognized. {nl}Maybe the Pilgrim's Way was also a means to get the clues to enter the Cathedral and be recognized by Gesti? {nl}Ahh, then could Naktis have entered the Cathedral already?
It won't budge. {nl}Where's the key?
What's the story behind this? {nl}The entrapped soul simply gave the scriptures and vanished.
Does the medicine really work?

Have you ever had your fortune told? It is quite accurate, isn't it? {nl}Goddess Laima knows everything. Fate, foresight, and luck. {nl}I think she may have known beforehand about all these disasters coming.
I pray to Goddess Gabija everyday. It keeps the house warm. {nl}As you may already know, Goddess Gabija controls fire and since I'm a housewife, I am close to fire as well.
My husband always prays to Goddess Zemyna. {nl}If you want a good potato harvest, you shouldn't get on her bad side. {nl}Goddess Zemyna is the goddess of the earth. She oversees farms and agriculture.
Speaking of which. {nl}About the plants overgrowing ever since Medzio Diena four years ago...
I wonder what Goddess Zemyna will think of it. {nl}Everything will be revealed when the goddess returns but... {nl}Oh, what blasphemous words I speak.
Have you ever seen the stars glittering red in the night sky? {nl}That's the very symbol of Goddess Vakarine. {nl}She leads the evening star and wakes Goddess Ausrine the following day.
She also oversees energy and rest, so she is the guardian of travelers like you. {nl}Shout Goddess Vakarine's name three times when your legs hurt and you'll feel much better.
What are you doing here? {nl}Did the goddess also tell you to go to Klaipeda in your dreams?
Still following me after all that? {nl}Fine, struggle all you want.
There is a Mage Tower near Fedimian known to have been built by Archmage Agailla Flurry. {nl}The tower has never been revealed and no entrance can be found.
Well, that's why some say it's just a made up story... {nl}But recently there have been people claiming to have come from there.
The size of Goddess Zemyna's Statue will amaze you. {nl}Even if half of it was buried underground because of the Great Earthquake, {nl}the remaining half would still be too huge for all of it to be seen at once.
Welcome. I heard you were coming from Uska. {nl}Don't just stand there. I wish to have a word with you.
So, you're the one who got the revelation from the Crystal Mine, right? {nl}If it's alright with you, I'd like to hear the details.
Amazing. {nl}We also follow the first Paladin's will and came here to guard this place. {nl}Same goes for the Watchers here.
The first Paladin was told many things by the goddess. {nl}Threats of Gesti, things to abide by, and that a Savior would come.
Anyway, I will go back to battle so please help the guards and my followers. {nl}I'll meet you again in Jade-Filled Cliff.
Disciple of the Elderly
Helping reconstruct Fedimian may be more meaningful than pottery. {nl}But people need something to soothe their hearts.
I have also been placing clay tablets, scribed with people's wishes, inside the spiral of pots. {nl} To search for and read the little wishes from people of ancient times is quite enjoyable.
Fedimian Old Lady
It's relieving to see the Holy District intact. {nl} All of this is due to a blessing from Goddess Zemyna.
Get the Token of Training from the Training Manager. {nl}I'll let you join our troop if you can pass the training.
You should take responsibility for the troop's safety in the Training Camp. {nl}It'd be a bad idea to leave these excited young men without any supervision, right?
Uska told me about you. {nl}All the Revelators I've met so far were no better than the Kepas, though.
Help the herbalists before you get into training. {nl}I need to see if you have what it takes to protect my troops. Training will come after.
My father told me Klaipeda is also becoming a difficult place to live.
There are many people who want to buy things but it's not easy to get what they want. {nl}We have enough food supplies for now but it won't last long.
I heard the town men can't make their way back because of the monsters. {nl}We have food but it will run out soon...
How will we live if this continues to go on? {nl}Where have all the goddesses gone?
It's a good idea to sell the various items you get from killing monsters, {nl}but using them to craft new items isn't such a bad idea either.
Although we need to be self-sufficient, things like recipes are better bought from the merchants. {nl}You need to know how to make it before you actually craft one yourself.
Be sure to kill any sparkling monsters you encounter. You might get some great items as trophies. {nl}And what about buying me some drinks for the good information I just gave you?
If you have any questions, head over to the Pyromancer Master's Laboratory. {nl}Thankfully, you can read a lot of books there for free.
Each Goddess Statue is known to have different abilities depending on which goddess it depicts. {nl}Strangely, though that Statue is not of Goddess Vakarine, it can still send you to your desired location.
Adventurer Varkis' Spirit
If only I had a little more time... {nl}The data I've collected near the Dykyne Fork... I can't leave it...
Now I can leave without any regrets. {nl}Goodbye. Be careful of that man...
Use this scroll to open a niche of space and find the Key of the Great King. {nl}You'll never know what will pop out, so be careful.
Crumbled Chapel
This is where a small chapel was once located. {nl}A Statue of Goddess Vakarine appears here once a day.
Stamina can be recovered by destroying Tree Root Crystals.{nl}They are an abnormality that began to appear after Medzio Diena. {nl}But rest assured, because the research results have shown it's perfectly safe.
So Degil sent you... Here... Here it is.
The goddess taught us to help others. {nl}I'm just abiding by her teachings.
I'd have just stood there if not for your help. {nl}My arms still hurt... {nl}I understand that the situation is not normal.
The morning comes after the night goes. {nl}Goddess Ausrine is the one who leads the morning. {nl}Not only that, but she is also the one we meet after we die.
Strange Goddess Statue
Come, angry resentful souls.
Soldier Recruit Bran
You're the one who helped us a while ago.
Training Manager Alius
Stop!
That's terrible. {nl}You'd be dead before you could be of any help on the battlefield.
If I meet the sculptor again, {nl}I'll ask him to decorate it with purple and green feathers!
Don't you think it would look great? {nl}Purple and green... Hehe.
The sculptor created us. And we received the goddess' revelation. Yep! He made us. {nl}We follow the sculptor's will to comfort the souls.
The souls are great. They're like fireflies or beetles. {nl}It's wonderful just watching it. Like where the sculptor is.
We can no longer be approve of Sequoia's actions. {nl}We owls will be destroyed if we leave him be. {nl}Who then will lead all the souls?
I have been watching the abyssal darkness of this holy forest: things like the hatred and greed of humans.
It's regrettable that we have to get rid of an old friend... {nl}But we can't just stand by and watch it do evil.
I was almost destroyed by Sequoia but I can't just stop guiding the poor souls. {nl}When will this tragedy end?
I shall leave when the time comes. {nl}But until then, I will protect this place.
There's still so many more things to research...
Where are the others? {nl}The merchants? {nl}The soldiers? {nl}Where are the teachers?
I've never seen a Sequoia go crazy like that. {nl}We'll all be destroyed. We will become dust!
Long ago, I befriended many humans. {nl}It's not a pleasant thing to meet your friends again as souls.
Isn't it cute? {nl}I was nervous when I first saw it, but it approached and cuddled me. {nl}It's so cute. I'm gonna have to take it home with me some day.
It's not easy working in the woods, but it's better than the dried and weathered valley. {nl}I heard the wind there is hot. I don't want to go there.
We always lack soldiers, but thankfully not eager, young men.
Then what's the problem? {nl}We make soldiers, not coffins. {nl}You need strength to join the war, mere passion will just lead to defeat.
The goddess is also indifferent... {nl}I still have a many things I want to do... But I was killed by the monster... {nl}Many others have also died, their belongings scattered around the forest.
I don't have much memory of when I was alive. {nl}The monsters raided when the Owl Statue was about to guide me and then I was left alone. {nl}I hope there won't be other souls like me any more.
You are the chosen one. {nl}Do not forget that. {nl}The revelation is prepared for you. {nl}You need to get the revelation and carry on the will of the goddess.
May the blessings of the goddess be with you in your journey.
You can get stamina by destroying Tree Root Crystals. {nl}It grows back after you destroy it. Weird, huh?
When the Divine Beast raged in the capital, I was born.
We are willing to accept additional requests but... {nl}If something like this were to happen without notice then... Phew...
Isn't Vacenin really nice? {nl}I really want to enlist in his unit but I can't find the right opportunity.
Well... It is better to meet people when they're alive than dead, you know?
I was waiting for the Owl Statue to guide me. {nl}But I saw a strong monster swallow a soul, so I hid. {nl}I barely saved myself but you must kill that monster to save the captured soul.
I don't know about the other owls, but I still have hope. {nl}The goddess will not abandon us. {nl}Looking at the revelations left in the world, I'm sure she has plans for us. {nl}Please gather the scattered revelations.
Bramble's subordinates are still going wild. {nl}More people will die if this goes on. {nl}Please help the humans fighting against monsters.
Well... Why am I still here? {nl}Maybe it's not yet my time to leave. {nl}No one knows, not the Owl Statue nor other souls. {nl}Unless it was the goddess who can see the future. No one knows their fate anyway, right?
Have you not met other Revelators yet?
I don't know much about the dream of the goddess or the revelation... {nl}But one thing for sure is that there are a lot of people like you.
I named it Spion. {nl}Why I named it that is... Well... Doesn't it sound cool?
That guy who's playing with a furry friend is Pitt, my long time friend. {nl}We've been friends since we were young and emotional. We really wanted to be heroes.
And while listening to stories about Vacenin, we just entered the army. {nl}But isn't it cool? One day, I will enter Vacenin's troops and be a hero.
Your abilities prove your competence. {nl}If you have something to say, do it with results!
Only the best soldiers are accepted to Vacenin's troops. {nl}It's important to prove that you are the best.
Oh... That's weird. I had it all here a while ago...
About half of the supplies are transferred from each town and the rest are old ones that are repaired or self-supported. {nl}You can't expect their morale to be high when the situation is like this.
I sell equipment to soldiers who lack supplies. {nl}Can't give them away though. I have a family to feed...
I can't rest even for a little while because of the Vubbes.
You never know when monsters will appear in trails like these.
I've got some antidotes left. {nl}Take as many as you want.
Sorry I can't be of much help.
Antidote? {nl}Of course I have some.
I used up what I had... {nl}But the people across may have some.
You came here without antidotes? {nl}Here, take this.
I ran out. {nl}Maybe others have some.
I have antidotes. {nl}I'll wish for Dezek's well being.
Dezek's lucky. {nl}Usually, he'd been eaten.
You must be out of your mind going around the gorge without antidotes. {nl}Here, take this.
I used up all I had a few days ago. {nl}Maybe some other people have it.
It's a good day for Scorpio to show up. {nl}Damp and dark.
There are many scorpions here. {nl}I get chills on my neck whenever something cracks underfoot.
Be careful during rainy dusks like these. {nl}Scorpio tend to show up around these times.
Scorpio are venomous nowadays. {nl}You have to be careful.
Rain again. {nl}The Scorpio must be moving around now.
Carved Writings
I have prepared five dilemmas so that our enemy can't get their hands on it. {nl}But neither of you can pass it if you are not prepared.
Find it. The road will open when it has been proven that you are the true Revelator.
What makes you walk towards the light in a place full of darkness?
The harder you seek it, the stronger you become, but if you refuse to seek it, you will become weak. {nl}What is it?

Beholder
If it isn't you, the one who released Goddess Saule. {nl}Why are you putting your life on the line?
There's no need for all these troubles. {nl}You should follow the others' example and immerse yourself in peace. {nl}And pray that the goddess will grant you your wishes.
I warned you, but you just wouldn't listen.
You shall pay the price for your choice.
I have underestimated you.
This isn't over! {nl}I'll be watching from the Fallen Worry Forest.
Warning
Tainted. Do not use!
This is the first revelation I made.{nl}For you, it will be the third.
My strength will weaken every time I put a part of myself into a revelation.{nl}More than a thousand years will have passed by the time this revelation reaches you, {nl}and even my consciousness will have ceased to exist.
That is why I needed to find a guardian to protect the revelation.{nl}Unfortunately, my sisters and I did not come to an agreement on my revelation, {nl}and I was not able to leave the revelation to most of them.
Only Saule supported my revelation so I left her with this revelation.{nl}And for a very long time, I went on a journey in search of a guardian.
When I thought about humans like you, a promising idea came up.{nl}The demons look down on humans so, {nl}they could not even imagine that I would leave the revelation to you.
But most of all, I trusted humans.{nl}You must have seen it yourself by now.{nl}Despite going through disasters such as the Tree of Despair, {nl}humans don't lose hope easily.
The guardian of the next revelation will be one who unites the kingdom. {nl}You can find my next revelation in the deepest part of the Royal Mausoleum where he rests.
The mausoleum is in the valley area. {nl}I will open the portal for you.

I'm not sure if the mine should be operating at a dangerous time like this. {nl}Even if mining is our livelihood, our lives are still more important.
I used to be a miner myself. {nl}I didn't see many monsters back then, but I heard it's very different nowadays.
They say there are many holy relics hidden in the Tenet Church. {nl}Some of them are said to transport people to a place where no one can go... {nl}Amazing, isn't it?
One day, I will find out. {nl}Even if that entails my meeting the goddess.
I don't know what to do if you are like that...

Thank you.

It would seem the other monsters have what remains.
Thank you.

I'm so hungry. {nl}Please give me something to eat.
That's not enough. {nl}Give him some more meat.
He says he feels dizzy. {nl}Is the medicine not working?
Are you still hungry...?

Put your wishes into a pot and it might come true... {nl}I know it is a tradition but restoring Fedimian is more important than pottery.
I only know silver craft, so this is all I can do to help. {nl}Of course, I would like to help restore the market area if I had the strength.
Old Potter
The workshop was destroyed by the earthquake on Medzio Diena. {nl}It's been four years since I last worried on how to live.
I used to do silver craft but now I'm using my talents to make pottery decorations. {nl}People from across the kingdom gather here for their wishes.
Wagon Carrier
It's a pot to put your wishes in. {nl}Look inside and you'll see clay tablets with wishes written on them. {nl}Some of them are pretty funny.
Thankfully, workers from different areas are gathering to help restore Fedimian. {nl}Look at where we've come since Medzio Diena. {nl}I really thought the world would end that day.
Fedimian Guard
It's impossible to see the gigantic Statue of Goddess Zemyna in one complete view. {nl}Even after its lower half was buried underground after the huge earthquake.
What?{nl}How did you get up here?
The Kingdom's Flag
The eternal kingdom shines bright. {nl}Zachariel succeeded in unifying all the lands into one powerful kingdom.
This kingdom is the only one in the land. It does not need a name.
Story of the Millenary
The Millenary Festival for the Founding of the kingdom just started.
Everyone's drinking honey mead, dancing to the goddesses, and laughing their hearts out.
Festival Zensho
When Zachariel established the kingdom, he built the capital city around a tree called the Divine Tree.
The Emperor, together with priests, blessed this Divine Tree every year.
Records of Medzio Diena
In the year 1091, less than 100 years after the celebration of Millenary, {nl}the Divine Tree suddenly surged from the ground and damaged many cities in its wake.
The tree was so tall that it touched the sky and none could measure its dimensions.
Flora
On Medzio Diena, many plants and animals turned into violent monsters.
If you could understand the nature of the changes, reversing it may be possible.
Declaration of Klaipeda Priest-Bishop
On Medzio Diena, the Klaipeda Market disappeared and the king passed away. {nl}Most ministers and officials of the kingdom perished as well, so we cannot expect support from the Capital.
Hence, under the circumstances, I declare my autonomy as the bishop of Klaipeda. {nl} - Bishop Baek
Hero Biography
If it wasn't for the four heroes, most cities would have probably been destroyed. {nl}Their holy weapons were a sight to behold during Medzio Diena.
Among them, the Paladin Master was a hero who saved many lives in the capital. {nl}Currently, he has gone to Silverstream Gorge to fight a great evil.
History of the Rebellion
When the great swordsman, Ruklys, completed the Fortress of the Land, {nl}many who admired him gathered under him.
Their power grew to that of a city-state over time,{nl}and it is suspected that Ruklys' ambition grew as well.
Ruklys' influence grew so much that he eventually revolted against King Kadumel.
It was a huge rebellion. The entire city took part. {nl}That's why some record it as a civil war.
The rebellion initially favored Ruklys, but the tides turned {nl}when the great Premier Eminent and marksman Lydia Schaffen joined the war.
It all ended two years later, when Ruklys died at the hands of Lydia Schaffen.
Because of the revolt, Ruklys' city lost its name and fell under an everlasting curse. {nl}Even now, that curse turns everything into stone.

Klaipeda Goddess Statue
Only the Dievdirbys that carved it and Modestas know for whom the Goddess Statue in Klaipeda's Central Plaza is.
Many challenged Modestas for a wager but he never lost until he died.
Guardian of Zachariel's Royal Mausoleum
Aside from the guardians who watch over Zachariel's Royal Mausoleum,{nl}there are stone statues guarding the Royal Mausoleum.
Activated with flowing mana, {nl}the guardian statues move as if they were alive. Some can even talk.
Maven's Opinion
The easiest way to tell clerics and wizards apart is to see how they use the grace of the goddesses. {nl}They can turn the grace of the goddesses to different forms.
And that power of changing grace is called mana.
Goddess Gabija of Fire
Pyromancers use the blessings of Gabija, the goddess of fire, as their main force.
It differs on the type of element, and depends on the grace of Goddess Gabija, {nl}but some elements may ignore oxidation.
For this, you will need great academic standards as well as faith in Goddess Gabija.
Will of All Things
The base forms of all things are water, earth, wind, and fire, {nl}and these are controlled by the goddesses.

Agailla Flurry's Diary
Lord Helgasercle is still going after my tower, {nl}and I can't find a successor to continue my mission.
My life feels like that of a waning fire. {nl}Even so, I shall light up the last bit of my life to find one.
Because of Helgasercle, a great chaos will come down on this world. {nl}It's a desperate gamble to leave the tower to a goddess who should be taking care of the world's flame.
But my mission must not fall under the hands of the demons, {nl}so I am counting on the future Goddess Laima foretold.
It was such a long journey. {nl}We'll know whether or not it was the right life or decision when the time comes.
Jane's Diary, the Wizard Apprentice
I came to Agailla Flurry's room to pick up cleaning materials, {nl}and I saw Flurry talking to a woman with giant flames swaying around her body.
The ambiance terrified me, so I hid behind a wall and watched. {nl}Then suddenly, a scary demon rushed in.
Flurry... turned into a handful of ashes by illuminating a great light. {nl}Did that demon do something? {nl}I had no idea, even as a wizard apprentice.
The demon somehow disappeared behind the flaming woman... {nl}There was nothing I could do, so I ran away.
After a few days, my seniors told me that Gabija would be the new owner of the tower. {nl}When the goddesses disappeared from the world, I was told to keep quiet.
Are things really going to be okay? {nl}Well... those people were never wrong about anything before so I guess it will be.
Chronomancer Ron
Archmage Agailla Flurry, owner of the Mage Tower, {nl}made many contributions to magic.
She learned many spells and even created a new category of skills.
The most prominent example of which was Chronomancy - time magic. {nl}With it, Agailla Flurry lived a long life.
There were many others in the past who lived longer than you might expect, {nl}but Agailla Flurry is the first to have lived a long life by her own design.
The Pedigree of Magic
Magic, at the beginning, began from the investigation of mana {nl}and the review of basic elements.
After that, the basic senses, religious belief of the goddesses, {nl}and mathematical approaches were mixed to find areas for expansion.
The research twisted previous notions of time and space, {nl}which were beyond the changes of the body, {nl}and the rules of physics and the elements progressed significantly.
The Report of the High Barrier Magic
The barrier in this tower could not have possibly been created by the Demon Lord alone.
It acts like a tight-knit net. {nl}Someone with a normal level of divine power cannot escape from it.
For what reason was this barrier created?{nl}Is it related to the fact that the goddess who controls the flames of this world is staying here?
Agailla Flurry called Gabija to this tower, so this barrier is not meant to lock Gabija in. {nl}To find out the reason for this, we first have to understand the composition of the barrier.
After a long investigation, we've found that this barrier was {nl}not only created with the power of Helgasercle, but rather blended with mana of different wavelengths.
We've also found that mana was composed by aligning the foundation stones in a certain position.
We were able to retrieve some of those foundation stones from various areas in the kingdom. {nl}The new information that we learned from them was astonishing.
The mana provided to use barrier magic wasn't voluntary. {nl}We theorize that the levels of the Demon Lords were divided and sealed into the foundation stones and aligned into a position.
The key to unlock this barrier is in the foundation. {nl}We'll continue to search for the answer after we block Helgasercle's invasion.
The Understanding of Mana
Unlike priests who control the blessing of the goddess directly, {nl}the wizard is defined as a person who releases various magic information or the blessing of the goddess.
Okay so, what is mana? {nl}We can say the true quality of mana is the life force on this land. {nl}The life force of nature. It doesn't just imply the length of lives.
The life force is a form of energy that composes this world and it spreads like branches to various places in the world. {nl}If you could find the source of that energy, you may obtain astonishing power.
The Diary of Antares' Investigation
As I was investigating mana, I discovered one important fact: {nl}The mana which flows steadily in the Mage Tower behaves strangely on the top of the tower
After lengthy research, I found out that there is a third type of energy which is {nl}different from the types of mana we know of, and it has a shape of a specific object.
This object must be from the era of Agailla Flurry as no one knows the existence of this object.
I am sure that this object will bring a new beginning of magic, {nl}but since it is separated at the highest place atop the tower, we have no way to reach it.
We can't demolish the tower nor destroy part of it just to get it.
I will end my writing by stating that this object has more to be investigated.

Importance of Rest
Young men nowadays are so restless. {nl}They try to do everything while standing up.
Whether it be making weapons, making potions, or even cooking, they try to do it while standing. {nl}You must calm yourself and sit in a comfortable position.
Sit down and prepare all the tools and materials you need. {nl}Remember that creation comes after preparations.
Goddess Austeja
Thank you again in the name of the goddess. {nl}Now I will follow the stars in search of Goddess Ausrine.
It may be better for me to just guard the seal. {nl}But I believe finding all my lost sisters will be the solution to all of this.
I wish you well... {nl}And may you and this land be blessed. 
Right. I think so too. {nl}The monsters are definitely preying on our honey. {nl}But it is better to have evidence on hand, so bring a piece of beehive {nl}from Saltus Bee Farm.
Coward
I'm called a coward but I can't do anything. I'm really scared.
I see, you're the one the bees have been whispering about. {nl}I am Austeja, the goddess of destiny.
The seal of this farmland has stabilized, thanks to you. {nl}But the other Revelators have lost themselves due to the evil force flowing from the Spring Light Woods.
I will be using all of my powers to prevent this from happening any more... {nl}Thus, I cannot move away from here, let alone save them.
Please save them and the Spring Light Woods.
Investigation Unit
Why have so many more monsters appeared?
The monsters have ruined the entire harvest.
As you may already know, our kingdom has five major goddesses and other goddesses who{nl}assist them. But nobody knows where all of them are now.
Flower Shop Lady
People don't buy flowers anymore. {nl}The only flowers they buy are the ones to offer for the goddesses' return. {nl}It's really depressing in many ways.
I hope Klaipeda becomes lively like it used to be... {nl}With the fragrance of flowers in the air and people dancing in spring to worship Goddess Zemyna, {nl}the goddess of the Earth...
Warning
Beware of Leaf Bugs! They are different from Beetles. {nl}It is hard to fight them when they come in flocks so be careful. 
Notice: Large Kepa is not an onion!{nl}Wearing goggles is useless against Large Kepa. {nl}Watch out for powerful attacks that shake the ground.
Please worship the Goddess Statue with a pious mind. You will grow stronger with {nl}the Goddess Zemyna's power, blessed by the Overseer of the Earth herself.
The Statue of Goddess Zemyna lies at the end of this road.
Warning! Hanaming-infested area. {nl}Do not be fooled by their cute appearance. {nl}They attack in groups and...{nl}(Red marks are covering the rest.)
Caution! What happens to you beyond this point is your responsibility! {nl}Golems are rumored to appear in this area. Do not go any further.
P.S. It is better to run away than to pray to the goddess when you encounter Golems.
The goddesses have disappeared. {nl}But if we fight bravely against the demons, perhaps the goddesses will return someday. {nl} - Laimonas
Attention to those who come to Klaipeda after having a dream about the revelation. {nl}Knight Commander Uska is waiting for you in the Central Plaza.

East Siauliai Woods
It is unknown who the statue honors or how old it is. {nl}But it certainly has mysterious powers that move selected people to other areas.
Good job. {nl}I have done my task. {nl}It is my time now.
Go forward. {nl}The Sculptor is waiting for you. {nl}I was glad to have guided you.
Ah...
Danger! The vacant lot below these crossroads {nl}has regularly seen dangerous monsters. Entrance is forbidden! {nl} - The Fedimian Market
People are now praying less and less to the goddesses. {nl}They're losing hope...
How could I have forgotten you... {nl}Please do not roam around this cursed land {nl}and go to the arms of the goddess.
Holiday Notice
I have been enlisted to the army to save the kingdom. {nl}Therefore, the restaurant will be closed in the meantime. {nl} - Owner of Klaipeda's Specialty Restaurant, Vulinya
Don't blow out the candles. {nl}They guide the souls so they don't lose their way.
As you know, the King died on Medzio Diena and the fate of other royalty and nobility were no different. {nl}The kingdom is holding together somehow but... now we can only pray.
Now we can only pray...
When the spire is bathed with a red light the... door... to fantasy shall be opened.
King Zachariel's Will
Dear Revelator. {nl}Listen to the interpretations of the revelation.
Hmpf... {nl}Who would've thought that I would be challenged by humans...
Your death shall be utmost painful!
Soldier Recruitment Notice

Honor. {nl}That is what your uniform will be made of. {nl} - Klaipeda Recruiting Station
Warning! Civilians prohibited.
Only authorized personnel are allowed inside.
Impossible.
Completing this spell will help the soldiers. {nl}Will I be able to make it?
The soldiers will die if I don't make it. {nl}I have to be strong.
I can do it. {nl}This time, I will kill Gaigalas.
Unfortunately, I cannot solve it for you. It is the will of Maven. {nl}However, I am able to give some words of advice.
The Great Cathedral was built by Silvestro Maven 660 years ago.
The curse of Naktis... Only curses remain where she treads. {nl}And she is now invading the Great Cathedral in search of the revelation.
We tried our best to impede them until your arrival. {nl}But as you can see, we've reached our limit.
Chapel Table
...Only after three years since Ruklys learned from my teachings...
...two years after the war, my first disciple ended up dead...
...year after Lydia Schaffen left the Great Cathedral...
...One of the three disciples, Agailla Flurry...
It has been an old tradition of this town to make pots with wishes inside,{nl}and offer it to the goddess. {nl}Wouldn't this disaster end when the goddess returns?
The writing on the platform as I recall went like this... {nl}Remember the holy number with your two eyes. {nl}The light of the candles drives away the evil dark.
Remember the number written on the candle holder. {nl}And light that many candles to solve it.
The relics have fallen into the demons' hands because of my weakness. {nl}But they shouldn't have reached Naktis yet.
The other relics and keys are also in danger, so you better move quickly.
Writings on the Altar
Everlasting goddess. {nl}May we praise your infinite mercy.
Life withers and the soul has nowhere to go. {nl}Only the goddess can save us.
I have sent the bishop there.
Monsters! Run!
Maven's Device
Maven's Device that the bishop talked about. {nl}There is a small keyhole.
Blue Pawndel
What is it?
You're not kidding, are you?
Black Pawnd
What's up? {nl}You suspect something?
Can I trust you?
Naktis
I won't hand over the revelation to petty humans!
Cathedral revelation
Interpretation of the revelation
A thousand years ago, before your generation... {nl}This is the story of the time before I left the revelation with the Great King Zachariel.
This land was full of chaos when the Great King Zachariel tried to raise a new kingdom. {nl}Only one place seemed filled with life, and Zachariel wanted that place.
But the future I saw in that land had only death and regret. {nl}Thus, I left a prophecy that moved the capital elsewhere {nl}when the kingdom reached a thousand years of age.
It is now up to the humans to fulfill that prophecy. {nl}The end lies beyond the fog.
I plan to leave the end of this story in the next revelation. {nl}Find my next revelation in the Mage Tower.
Laima
There are still more keys left to find. {nl}It's a relief that they are all secretly guarded by Maven's plan.
What once housed the goddesses is now filled with demons. {nl}Maven, the first bishop, would be very sad about this.
Insert the Relics that match each altar. {nl}Then you will be able to get Maven's first key.
First, prepare. {nl}The Wood Goblins will be attacking soon.
The Great Cathedral used to be where we worshiped the goddess. {nl}Now it's turned to a nest of demons...
It's the key. Go to the Veiniky Altar. {nl}Maven's device can be found there.
Naktis' servants have become disoriented.
I presume this is the key that releases the device at the Veiniky Altar.
The next device is at the Veiniky Altar.
This drug really better work...
This drug better work...
Food... Did you bring food?
Did you see the pilgrim with never-ending hunger? {nl}He's also under Naktis' curse. {nl}That's why his hunger can't be filled, no matter how much he eats.
Ugghh... What did I eat? {nl}I feel sick.
The drug better work...
They're feeling nauseous? {nl}I can't tell if the drug is working just by looking at their reactions.
I'll give you the drug. {nl}Give it to the pilgrims.
Now I better go and bury the bishop.
Thank you for helping me bury the bishop.
Red Marble
It's emitting red light.
Blue Marble
It's emitting blue light.
Yellow Marble
It's emitting yellow light.
Green Marble
It's emitting green light.
Purple Marble
It's emitting purple light.
It's time to let Naktis' servants know about the location of Maven's device.
Maven's device will not be destroyed easily but that doesn't mean it's indestructible.
Naktis' servants are showing strong obsession {nl}over their own things inside Maven's device.
Naktis' servants are showing strong obsession {nl}over the things inside Maven's device.
Have you found the last key?
If Naktis' servants took it, then the last key must be in the hands of Naktis.
Naktis' servants have reported to her that we have the key.
The shining keys and marbles...
The color of the shining keys and marbles... {nl}they seem to match each other and are related.
It seems something reacted.
We are the priests sent to undo Naktis' curse at Pilgrim's Way. {nl}We are looking for the many documents about the demons and their curse in the Cathedral.
The device will be released when all the floor plates are pressed down.
Take the bombs from the chest. You must destroy the entrance of the Royal Mausoleum.
Help!
Warning
Stop! You cannot go beyond this point without permission!
What? You seem a bit inexperienced but still may be of help to us. {nl}You'll be able to meet the officer when you follow this road.
What the...! Losing the revelation right in front of...! {nl}This isn't the end! Remember that!
Well then, let's start the experiment.
Spoiled Food
(Potato dumplings. It feels like I shouldn't eat them.{nl}Chow down?)
(It's spoiled.)
Preserved food
(It's preserved food that is dried or salted.{nl}Doesn't seem edible by itself.)
Liquor
(Just smells like liquor.)
Explore
It seems like it can be used only in the Crystal Mine 3F...
Found a piece of paper underneath the soil.
Eating more would be rather risky.
Something feels horrible inside...
Oooh...
I don't want to eat that ever again.
This is dangerous. I want to throw up!!
(There seem to be a lot of interesting books. {nl}Which one shall I read?)
Wonders of the Deep Forests
Many wooden owl statues of unknown purpose are found deep within forests.
Legend says that a sculptor made the statues to help guide dead souls.
It is said he has hidden for centuries and is still sculpting statues.
Fallen City of the Kingdom
The Millenary was held for the thousand year anniversary of the Kingdom.
A hundred years later, the Divine Tree rose up at the center of the capital, {nl}and disaster struck. The world was ravaged by plants.
The capital was filled with the anguished cries of people, {nl}and soon turned into a fallen city.
Monsters
Before Medzio Diena, there were only Vubbes.
But after, monsters with distinct and ferocious characteristics showed up in packs.
Siauliai Companies
The main industry of Siauliai is mining, and its specialty is crystals from the Crystal Mine.
Currently only the 1st Mine Lot is being worked on, but the mines used to have two lots.
The 2nd Mine Lot was closed by the declaration of the bishop to seal away demons. {nl}The alchemist also resides in the village for this reason.
Summa Theologica
Everything about the Statue of Goddess Vakarine is beautiful, {nl}but its most beautiful part is the fact that its special powers {nl}can be used to take you to the world of the goddesses.
Legend of Cunningham
It is a story old enough to be lost from all memory.
During his compulsory labor in the mines,{nl}Cunningham met a strange girl that was around seven years old.{nl}The girl kept speaking of a great danger,{nl}but knew little about it herself.
Cunningham took pity on the girl and cared for her. Soon they became best friends.
But the happiness did not last long; soon the demons attacked the mines. {nl}With the help of the girl, Cunningham fought against the demons to repel Mirtis.
However, Mirtis was too strong and Cunningham had to make a tough decision.
In the end, Cunningham destroyed the mines, sealing Mirtis and himself in it.
Surgery Book Set
People did not forgive the family for waking up the sleeping demons. {nl}People chased away the family in fear of being corrupted {nl}and the family had to roam the kingdom with the people's oppression and discrimination.
The men of that family had a weird sickness. {nl}Their skin was dry and flaking,{nl}and they kept on scratching it as if they were in pain.
The skin cracked like the surface of dry earth, with blood and pus flowing out. {nl}They were in pain for a very long time and were unable to sleep. {nl}They were constantly in a state of nervous breakdown.
Kingdom Travelogue
Rhombuspaving Dale is a masterpiece of the goddess of wonder and nature. {nl}The lime stairs encompassing the southern land is filled with spring water and glows fantastically.
The color of the spring is sometimes sapphire and other times, jade green. {nl}Looking at their profound and mysterious colors makes you wonder if this is the work of the goddess.
My Confession
The many deaths of demons could not fill the emptiness in my heart. {nl}Once the goddess' great mission for me is over, I will be left with a long life full of boring moments.
In that case, I shall try to interpret{nl}the goddess' revelation for the rest of my remaining life.{nl}If this goes against her will, the goddess should punish me right now.
But it will give me the chance to look back at my life. {nl}And in the long run, it could help a Revelator who shows up in the future.
Reading Desk
(There are some books on the shelves below the reading desk.{nl}Which book shall I read?)
(It's too old and worn to look at.)
The 4th of X {nl} - {nl} There's been very little traffic coming to town from the capital. {nl} When one family moved in, the whole village threw a welcome party. {nl} After all, how many outsiders do we get to meet these days? {nl}
I might not know for what reason people would come all the way out here, {nl} but after Medzio Diena, it feels great to be in such a cheerful town. {nl} I might skip work tomorrow and party along. {nl} {nl}
The 5th of X {nl} - {nl} I wanted to befriend my new neighbors as soon as possible so I brought some potato dumplings over. {nl}At the door, I could hear the house rattle. My neighbor then appeared, expressionless, {nl}but then had a cheerful expression when he saw the potato dumplings. {nl}
He apologized for his lack of spirit before, as he and his son were putting up wallpaper. {nl} What a harmonious family, I wonder if I could create something like that?
The 10th of X {nl} - {nl} Mr. Raman, who lived at the bank of the creek opposite from us, went on leave. His wife said he was off to get firewood. {nl} Well, for a long time he was gone in Klaipeda. {nl}I've heard that you can find a lot of beautiful girls in Klaipeda. {nl}
The 13th of X {nl} - {nl} Today was Goddess Origin Day, but somehow everyone in town had stomach pains, and could not celebrate. Why this happened specifically on this day I do not know. {nl}Well, illnesses will be illnesses. After all that, we had to make potato porridge. {nl}
The 14th of X {nl} - {nl} Last night I had an argument with my little sister. {nl}Writing down what you really think isn't that embarrassing. After what happened, {nl}I made a necklace as a present to her, and she came back to me. {nl}Well, I had to give in eventually. Even so, on one morning, she disappeared to somewhere. {nl}
Ah, just now my neighbor made me some delicious porridge. {nl} In return I made them some warm soup. I can cook too, you know? {nl}Tonight will be another feast so I'm going to make sure to eat and drink plenty.
The 16th of X {nl} - {nl} I got a stomachache drinking soup that I didn't know already went bad. {nl} I double-checked the smell before eating it, but there was no bad odor. {nl}I felt horrible inside so I went to the well for water. Even with the water, I continued to feel horrible. {nl}
I've been throwing up a lot lately but it seems to be getting better now. {nl}Tomorrow I'm going to go see Mr. Gordon to get some medicinal herbs. {nl} My little sister still hasn't come back yet. When I go to her room, I find no clothes. Even Mr. Man is getting worried.
The 17th of X {nl} - {nl} The village was eerily quiet today. {nl}There are no signs of the people who went earlier to get herbs from Mr. Gordon.
The 23rd of X {nl} - {nl} This might be the last time I get to write in this diary. {nl} Lyliana, you are the only family I have left in this world... {nl} Please be alive somewhere... {nl}
{nl}(There is something written, but it's all jumbled up and has ceased to be legible.)
Unknown Date {nl} - {nl}Several days must've passed. {nl}I've been on the run for around two days now without food or sleep. {nl}The people who fled to Klaipeda were all caught and killed. {nl}I don't even know how many are still alive and can walk. {nl}Everything is as quiet as the shadows, yet moving at a quick pace. We are all tense from fear of attack.
They did not wish for any uproar or disorder. {nl}They are not people. {nl}We must somehow notify Klaipeda. {nl}A last resort would be to abandon everything we can't use and move out.
Oh. It's you. {nl}This is our army base camp, so feel free to relax.
Have you already met the other soldiers? {nl}Hmm... What's your name?
Alright, thanks. You guys are working hard. {nl}I want to talk to my aides. Where are they?
Do you have something to say?
Send the two from the entrance to the front lines? {nl}Ha, that's nonsense. Did they ask you for that?
It's you? That would bother me. {nl}Hmm... I'm thankful that you are willing to join the front lines even when you can have it easier here...
I hate people who lack responsibility. {nl}Are there people who can take over your positions?
I like your spirit. {nl}But that doesn't mean I can take you in without question.
We are the undefeated unit of Raimondas. {nl}I only accept the best soldiers I can find.
By the way, are you going to take this guy as well?
I don't know what he does, but please keep this in mind: {nl}War is not a joke. I'll let you take him if you're willing to work with him in battle.
Damn, I thought it would die after getting its throat cut. {nl}I hope it can just behave and die slowly now.
Oops. I was late this time. Well, it doesn't matter that much. {nl}Soon my masterpiece will be complete. I hope you guys like it.
Unknown Demon
Ah... I almost forgot. I'll be taking this guy along!
I can feel Laima's power.
This pain I haven't felt for a long time...
Even so, I will not waste my power on you.
I guess the real revelation is in the chapel? {nl}That Laima could only prepare this much. Such a pity.
This is the Seal of Space...{nl}
We will need the Revelator.
The Revelator has came here alone. {nl}Exactly what I wanted.
For what purpose did you come to this cursed city? {nl}Please go back if you have nothing in particular to attend to.
So you are the famous Revelator. The Knights of Kaliss are looking for competent people like you. {nl}If you're here to help them, I'll temporarily permit your entrance.
But please don't forget. The right to enter here belongs to our soldiers. {nl}We hope you don't create unnecessary trouble.
Salister... What are you even talking about? {nl}That's absurd...
The Symbol of Silt is in my hands thanks to you.{nl}If I pass this symbol to the dumb Royal Army or the Knights of Kaliss, they're going to give me more shifts on watch.
Only an ambitious and clever man such as I could unleash this object's true potential.
I will now use the power of Petrification and Ice to awaken this centuries-old power. {nl} Please stay there and observe.
I will help keep the Spirits of Time off of you!
What's happening? {nl}It's coming this way! Watch out!
Are you headed to the Great Cathedral, Revelator? {nl}Be careful! The demons have surrounded us!
The barrier is up and running. {nl}Please deal with Gesti while I activate the Divine Sphere.
If she's not on the first floor, then she must be on the second. {nl}I hope we're not too late.
This is my friend, Donatas. {nl}I will go up first to figure out Gesti's movements, so come up once you're ready.
Hey! You shouldn't come here!
So the Peltasta Master sent it... Ah, so this is what those cowardly miners were talking about.
No worries at all. I'm not scared. They're all fake rumors. {nl}It's no surprise the mine is shaking.
Request Bulletin Board
Here are all gathered requests. {nl}Caution: We are not responsible for the rewards of these requests.

Revelation of Mage Tower
This is an old story of Fedimian before the Goddess Statue was built.
A long time ago, the people of Fedimian were quite normal, {nl}not much different from the ordinary people of the rest of the world. {nl}However, the people of Fedimian did differ from their worldly peers in one aspect.
The people of Fedimian were very cautious.{nl}In the sense that they take the word 'cautious' much more seriously. {nl}These people were as cautious around fire as they were without.
The Fedimians were modest about this with others. {nl}Even those who stayed at Fedimian for a while could not pick up the trait.
Thanks to this behavior, the people of Fedimian fared better during tough times, {nl}as they were able to sense danger coming.
Because of this, no few words were said about the cautiousness of the Fedimian people.
In Fedimian, if someone dropped money on the ground, it would be gone forever. {nl}In a world where money mostly consists of silver coins, {nl}only the creditors would know exactly how much money has been lost in this manner.
Why money disappears into the ground at Fedimian remains unknown. {nl}Some people believe the Goddess Zemyna absorbs any money that makes contact with her area. {nl}Most commoners, however, believe this was done to reduce the demand of silver coins from creditors.
By believing that the goddess herself takes the silver,{nl}the people found it pointless to try and dig it up in her grounds. {nl}The fact that you can offer silver coins at Fedimian as tribute to her reinforces this idea.
In any case, the fact that one could lose money by dropping it on Fedimian soil {nl}has made Fedimians very careful in handling their money.
However, as much as one tries to be careful, mistakes still happen. {nl}More so with the case of young girls. {nl}One day, it happened to a girl named Aiste.
Normally, when one drops silver coins on the ground, it would scatter about on the road, {nl}and then disappear without a trace. {nl}{nl}Fedimians usually curse their own carelessness and move on, {nl}but Aiste was different: she wondered why and how it happened.
To find out what happened, Aiste began inspecting the area she lost her coins at. {nl}In her search she came across a beggar beside the deep end of the canal.
Aiste asked the elderly beggar, {nl}'Did you by any chance pick up the silver coins I dropped? {nl}{nl}Would you return them to me?{nl}I worked very hard everyday for those coins and really need them.'
The beggar was taken aback. Aiste was asking for the impossible. {nl}After all, finding dropped coins in Fedimian was unthinkable. {nl}The old beggar was about to explain this to Aiste, but instead remarked, {nl}'I've also lost coins in this area. It would be nice if you looked for mine as you searched for yours.'
Almost immediately, the beggar felt guilty of the mocking words he blurted out. He apologized to Aiste.
Why don't you go to where you work and explain what happened to them? Make sure you look lost.' The beggar then hesitantly added, {nl}'In the meantime, I'll be looking for your silver coins here.'
Upon hearing the beggar's words, Aiste thanked the beggar, and went on to follow his advice. {nl}Through his selfless act, the beggar suddenly felt a revived sense of responsibility. He looked toward the silhouette of the leaving Aiste, his heart heavy and warm from this experience.
Aiste went to the orchards at the outskirts of Fedimian where she worked. {nl}While one could just pick fruit from the trees there, it was also important to take the fruit that fell on the ground.
Smaller hands worked better for picking fruits, so young children were often hired at the orchards. {nl}Some orchards took it a step further: hiring monkeys, whose hands were smaller than that of children, to pick fruit. Monkeys did work more effectively than children, but often ate the fruit they picked. Thus, most owners relied on hiring children.
Returning, Aiste visited the orchard she worked at and explained her situation to the orchard owner. {nl}Unfortunately, the owner was not in a good mood, having just had a quarrel with his wife. {nl}He, like all other Fedimians, knew about the phenomenon, and saw no reason to give Aiste more money.
And so he said, {nl}'Just as you've been able to pick up all my fruit, you should be able to find your lost money at Fedimian, so do not tell me to give you a second pay.' {nl}The orchard owner's cold words brought tears to the girl's eyes. {nl}The sight broke his heart, but even so, he did not want to give her any more money.
He was soon overtaken by guilt and said, {nl}'If you really need that money, you should go to the silversmith's.'
Aiste set towards the silversmith's place as soon as she heard those words. {nl}Fortunately, the house was located outside Fedimian walls. {nl}Had it been inside, the silversmith ran the risk of losing his money and silverware to the soil.
It is for this reason that he lives on the outskirts of Fedimian. {nl}Aiste knocked on the front door and explained her situation to him as soon as he answered.
The silversmith, after hearing Aiste's story, stated, {nl}'Even for children it is foolish to be so careless. How could you not know that all money that falls on Fedimian soil disappears, never to be found again?'
Aiste was surprised by what the silversmith said and grew sad. {nl}After a while she asked, {nl}'Then why is it that such a cruel thing happens?'
Even the silversmith did not know the true answer, so he improvised, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna must be taking them.'
Hearing those words, Aiste replied, {nl}'Then I will just have to go ask the goddess.' {nl}The silversmith was astounded and replied, {nl}'While you're at it, why don't you ask the goddess to return my silverware?'
The silversmith did not take to heart his own words, but Aiste did. {nl}She immediately set out to do as she said. The silversmith felt sorry for Aiste, {nl}but did not have the courage to call her back as she faded into the distance.
An exhausted Aiste soon arrived at Zemyna's Goddess Statue. {nl}She prostrated herself before it and prayed to the Goddess Statue, her head completely down. {nl}'Oh, Goddess. Please return my lost silver coins.' {nl}Soon, while offering her prayers, Aiste could no longer hold in her sadness and she finally wept.
How long did she pray crying? {nl}Suddenly, Aiste heard a voice addressed to her. {nl}'My child, have you come to take back what you have lost?'
Aiste knew in her heart that it was Goddess Zemyna that was addressing her. {nl}She stopped crying, cleared her voice and replied so.
The goddess' voice was heard again. {nl}'Aiste, what you're asking of me is not by a method I approve of. Where I reign there is no harvest nor fruits for those who do not work.'
But I worked very hard today!'
I know. So instead, I will give you and the others a chance. Look under your feet.'
The goddess' voice faded with those words, and Aiste found silver coins under her feet. {nl}She looked to where she had left her silvers and found that the tears she shed had transformed into coins.{nl}Aiste was very happy, and made sure to pick up all the silver before leaving.
After a number of steps, Aiste thought about the silversmith, {nl}and, again, went to his house and knocked on his door. {nl}As if the silversmith was waiting for her return, he opened the door immediately and said. {nl}'I'm sorry. I regret sending you away like that. I'll give you some silver. {nl}This time, be careful not to drop any and get home safely.'
As the silversmith held out his silver coins, Aiste shook her head and said,{nl}'No thank you, the goddess returned all my coins. On top of that, she gave me even more. {nl}I remembered you saying you had also lost silver, so I came to give you my extra coins. You don't need to give me yours.'
At first, the silversmith was skeptical about the coins being returned, {nl}so he was surprised when Aiste showed him genuine coins. After thinking for a while, the silversmith said, {nl}'Then how about this. You give me what you want while you accept what I was about to give you. {nl}Isn't that fair? On top of that I'll give you a pouch to carry your extra silver.'
Aiste obliged and gave her extra coins to the silversmith. {nl}After this, the silversmith gave Aiste a bag of coins.
After leaving the silversmith's house, {nl}Aiste suddenly remembered that the old beggar must still be looking for her lost coins and worried for him. {nl}On her way to the beggar, she met the orchard owner again. {nl}Upon seeing Aiste, the orchard owner was overjoyed. {nl}'I was looking for you. I'm sorry for sending you off earlier. As an apology, I'll give you your salary again. {nl}Please be careful not to lose it this time.'
The orchard owner took out a large amount of coins, more than what Aiste's salary was, and handed it to her. {nl}However, Aiste shook her head and said, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna already returned my money to me. The silversmith also helped me, so now I actually have too much. {nl}Here, take a look.'
Saying that, Aiste opened the bag of coins she got from the silversmith and showed the orchard owner. {nl}The orchard owner was extremely surprised, as the amount of money she got from the goddess and the silversmith surpassed the amount he had.
Disregarding the amount Aiste had shown him, the orchard owner said, {nl}'Well, even so, I would be ashamed for not giving you my due, so please just take it.' {nl}After saying this, the orchard owner stuffed his coins into Aiste's bag and left. {nl}By the time Aiste could muster up the energy to call the orchard owner, he was too far away.
She hesitated for a moment but then set her mind on the beggar. {nl}After a bit of walking, Aiste arrived at where they met. The old beggar spotted her first and hurried over to her. {nl}He showed her the silver coins he was clenching onto and said, 'Look! I found your lost silver.' {nl}Aiste received the beggar's silver and then showed the beggar her bag and said, {nl}'Look, I found your silver coins too.'
Even though the beggar was exhausted, he cupped his hands to get his coins back. {nl}Seeing this, Aiste was brought to the brink of tears. {nl}She wondered how much begging the beggar had to do to give her her coins back. {nl}With a heavy heart, Aiste gave the old beggar the coins.
After that, Aiste also held out her bag and said, {nl}'This is a gift as thanks for looking for my silver. I was given this through Goddess Zemyna's grace.' {nl}Aiste then left before the Old Beggar could figure out how to reply.
The beggar looked towards Aiste's distant shadow, and opened the present she gave him, {nl}curious to what was inside. Inside, he was surprised to find dozens of silver coins. {nl}Now he understood why Aiste was able to depart much more quickly than she arrived - she had lightened her load by giving him the excess.
For a beggar who had been stingy over a single silver coin, the fact Aiste could simply give away several tens of times that amount moved him. {nl}The fact that Aiste, who had went off and solved the mystery of Fedimian, came back and gave him what she really didn't owe, made the beggar thankful.
The more he thought, the less the beggar was able to hold back his tears. {nl}As he cried, he noticed something odd - every shining teardrop that touched the ground transformed to silver coins.
The beggar could not believe his eyes, but quickly remembered Aiste words about a blessing from the goddess. {nl}After a while, the beggar stopped crying, and went to pick up the coins and put them in the bag Aiste gave him.
A few days later, the beggar went to the statue that Aiste prayed to. There, he took out one coin from the bag to keep, and offered the rest to the Goddess Statue. {nl}He then prayed to the goddess whole-heartedly and left. As the money he offered disappeared, the beggar again to shed tears, but that's another story.
After a few days, an odd rumor spread across Fedimian. {nl}The rumor claimed that silver no longer disappeared into Fedimian soil. {nl}The rumor did not sit well at first with older, experienced people, but some tested the rumor with a paltry amount of silver, {nl}and it turned out to be true. Everyone agreed that finally, the mysterious phenomenon of Fedimian has come to an end.
After some time, word of this occurrence reached the king. Curious as to why this happened, the king ordered an investigation. {nl}The hidden truth was brought to light, and Aiste's story was known.
The king praised the people that caused the miracle with their charitable hearts. {nl}Additionally, to honor the grace of the goddess, he decided to spend the national treasury to build a large statue dedicated to her.
On the day the statue was finally completed, {nl}something miraculous happened as the King and Aiste went together to make the first offering. {nl}From the circumference of the statue sprouted coins - all the silver coins that had been lost by Fedimians up until that time.
After heated debate, the Fedimian people decided to not to hoard their lost silver coins. {nl}Instead, they asked the king to collect all the coins and distribute them among the poor of the Kingdom. {nl}The king readily agreed, and gave the order to record this beautiful event into the history of the Kingdom.
Even now, nobody knows when and how the mysterious phenomenon of Fedimian started, {nl}but everybody knows when, how, and who helped unravel the mystery. {nl}It was through the kindness of Aiste and the people who helped her, as well as through the grace of the goddess, that the mystery came to an end.
The Gambler of Klaipeda
The Gambler of Klaipeda {nl}~A Short Story~
{nl}{nl}In the town of Klaipeda, there once lived a man by the name of Modestas. {nl}He was a good, honest man - but had one major flaw that his friends and family all worried about, his wife especially so. {nl}Modestas was not lazy nor very clever nor not too foolish. {nl}He did not drink or repeatedly get into fights. {nl}The man had one flaw, and it was that he loved to gamble.{nl}
During the day, Modestas would work hard and would never let himself go hungry - {nl}but whenever he earned more than he really needed, he would gamble. {nl}The wife would always try to save this money, but not one extra coin would ever go toward their home.
Whenever she could, Modestas' wife would often go to the shrine, and pray to the goddess' likeness. {nl}But Modestas continued his odd habits, and the people around him grew increasingly concerned. {nl}After all, the mind of a gambler would think, 'Today it may be small, but tomorrow it could be big!' {nl}And so the days rolled by, same as they ever were, until one peculiar day.
Like most of his days, Modestas was heading home after gambling away his excess coins. {nl}He was walking through the Siauliai Woods on the path to Klaipeda, when he saw a strange, old woman on the road.
This old woman seemed not only old and frail, but had an unnerving aura around her. {nl}She was acting strangely, as if deep in thought or as if she was obsessed with whatever she was doing. {nl}Modestas thought about simply ignoring the woman and walking past. Nothing would have happened if he did that, {nl}but curiosity got the better of him.
To be precise, what really turned his head toward the old woman was what she held in her hands. {nl}Gold. The woman seemed to be obsessing over two gold pieces, doing something with them. {nl}Unable to hear her mumbling, Modestas drew closer to the strange woman.
Over the jingling sound of gold, the old woman muttered. {nl}'If these two pieces of gold could ever marry, the baby gold would make me rich... but there's no life in these things...' {nl}Modestas heard those words, and decided to comment. {nl}'That gold won't make you rich by itself, so just put it into something worthwhile. {nl}Do you really think muttering at gold will do something?'{nl}
The old woman spoke plainly, 'Why not? If it works, this'll certainly be the most pleasant, risk-free way to wealth.' {nl}'That's ridiculous. You should do what I do and gamble.' {nl}The woman was incensed.
'So, you think your betting ways are better?' {nl}'Why wouldn't I? There are moments where I could win or lose, but your way won't make any gold at all.' {nl}With Modestas' words, the old woman paused in thought. Finally, she said, {nl}'Then let's have a bet.'
The disturbing aura around her grew as soon as the offer reached Modestas' ears. He couldn't outright refuse. {nl}'What kind of bet?' {nl}'We'll see whether your way or my way will make us richer.' {nl}'And if I lose?'
'Don't worry about that. You will win, and you will lose - that won't change. The rules are fixed.' {nl}'What do you mean by that?' {nl}'By taking my offer, you will fail once, and you will win once. No matter what happens.' {nl}'Well, yeah. Winning and losing is how gambling works.'
'No. No matter how unlucky things may seem, you will win your first gamble. {nl}And then, no matter how favorable life may seem, you will fail the next.'
Modestas was still confused by these strange words. {nl}'So, you're saying I'll win on every odd bet, and lose on every even one?' {nl}'Yes. It will be so. You will win some, and then you won't. Is that not fair? {nl}One coin will be enough to succeed, no matter how many bets you make. That is my offer.' {nl}'You think I'll switch between winning and losing, huh?'{nl}
With her hand to her chin, the old woman gave a puzzling response. {nl}'Three times each should be enough. Return to me after you make six gambles. {nl}Naturally, if you don't have more coin after your sixth bet, I will win.'
Modestas seemed to tremble. 'How much should I earn, then?' {nl}'You'll start with one gold piece,' she replied, 'and when you return, show me all your gold pieces but that one. {nl}If you stretch that single piece to anything more, then you win. As for time... you have one week.' {nl}'So, what do you get when I lose?' Modestas reminded her.{nl}
'Well...' the old woman lingered, 'If you win, everyone will know about my gold - {nl}and you'll have the power of winning and losing. On the other hand...' {nl}''On the other hand...'?' Modestas said, tensely.
'After I win, the friends you know will disappear every time you lose a bet.' {nl}Modestas was unnerved by the conditions set. He did not immediately object; instead, he thought of victory, {nl}and soon accepted. Modestas was, most of all, the kind of person who never backed down.
As Modestas and the old woman parted ways, he, in any case, knew he now had a dangerous power guaranteeing his victory at any time in the near future. {nl}He walked, looking for the next person to bet huge on. As he wondered how much to wager on his next move, he heard the sound of galloping behind him.
Modestas turned around. It was his good old friend, Sigfried, riding on horseback towards him. {nl}They knew each other well, as both had been together through the highs and lows of gambling. They exchanged greetings and talked about where they were going. Sigfried dismounted to walk at a leisurely pace with his friend, idly chatting along their way. {nl}
However, before long, Modestas could no longer continue walking with Sigfried. {nl}He was fully aware of his deadline, and had no time for such trivial activities. {nl}
Even during their normal everyday conversations, Modestas and Sigfried unconsciously made big and small bets. Eventually, one would utter the word, 'Bet?' unconsciously. {nl}Neither of them were rich so these bets weren't ever that significant. Knowing this would trigger the curse, Modestas really wanted to ask Sigfried to leave. {nl}In the end, Modestas uttered these words: {nl}
'Are you not busy? You seemed to be in a hurry on your horse before you passed by for a talk. You should stop worrying about me and go.' {nl}Sigfried, hearing Modestas' words, replied, {nl} 'I was busy, but I still have time to walk with you for another ten minutes or so. This horse might not look like much, but when it comes down to it, he can go pretty fast.' {nl}
Seeing Sigfried not budge, Modestas tried again to persuade him, {nl}'Wouldn't it be better to be early as opposed to be on time?' {nl}{nl}Hearing this, Sigfried became adamant, {nl}'Do you not believe what I just said, or are you willfully ignoring it all?' {nl}A disconcerted Modestas said, {nl}'No, I didn't mean it like that...' {nl}
However, before Modestas could say any more, Sigfried said, 'If you don't believe me, why don't we have a bet?' {nl}{nl}Naturally, the words, 'Sure. What do you want to wager?' rose up in Modestas' throat.
Considering Modestas' habit, to not immediately accept a gamble took superhuman willpower from him. {nl}'What... What kind of bet?' {nl}'We're going to bet on whether my horse is fast or not.' {nl}Modestas desperately fought against his inner gambler.
On the other hand, Sigfried was understandably confident, knowing with certainty that he would win the gamble, and was alright with betting his horse. {nl}With only a little money at hand, the bet became too good to refuse, and Modestas finally accepted. {nl}And, as expected, Modestas won. {nl}
As soon as the bet started, Sigfried tried every method possible to command his horse to move. Despite his efforts, it didn't move a single hoof at all.{nl}At the end, Sigfried repeatedly cursed its strange behavior. Realizing he'd be late to his appointment without a horse, he threw the reins to Modestas and sprinted away.{nl}As Sigfried disappeared, Modestas felt uncomfortable.
For Modestas, who had always been elated upon winning bets and depressed upon losing them, to win and feel depressed was a first in his entire life. {nl}
Knowing he had just deceived his long-time gambling friend, Sigfried, and also missed an opportunity to earn a lot of money, Modestas felt conflicted as he walked slowly alongside the horse he had just won. {nl}While walking, Modestas remembered the earlier warnings of his unconditional bet. He realized that now, with his upcoming defeat, he was doomed to not earn any more silver than he started with.
While walking along the road, Modestas encountered a group of soldiers. {nl}Upon looking closer, the soldiers seemed to be arguing about what to buy at a store. {nl}Modestas decided not to interfere and pass them, but the soldiers noticed him and called. {nl}
'You, the young man with the horse, can you come over and help us for a bit?' {nl}Modestas had no idea what these soldiers needed help for, but since he could no longer ignore them, he decided to head over. {nl}Once Modestas arrived, one of the soldiers said, {nl}'You came at just the right time. We would like you to referee a small gamble we're about to make here.' {nl}
Modestas was surprised when he heard the word, 'gamble', but was relieved to know he was only being asked to referee. After all, nothing could possibly happen if he was just refereeing. {nl}Modestas learned that the soldiers were fighting over which goddess was the best. {nl}
What started as trivial banter turned into a big argument, which finally grew to become a big money bet. The soldiers had already gathered their money and only had to decide the winner. Unfortunately, every goddess got equal votes and a winner couldn't be decided.{nl}Thus, the soldiers decided to settle the bet by calling the first person who passed by, asking him who he thought the best goddess is, and deciding the winner from there. The soldiers agreed that the first passer-by would symbolize the will of whatever goddess he favored. {nl}
The soldiers did not tell Modestas who voted for which goddess, for fear of his decision being affected by the expressions of each individual soldier. {nl}The soldiers did tell him however, how much they have each wagered. Just by seeing the gold nuggets, he could easily figure that there was a large amount of money in this bet. {nl}
Since a big jackpot was on the line, the soldiers waited with bated breath for Modestas' answer. {nl}Knowing there was no right answer to the question, Modestas simply said aloud the name of his own favorite goddess. {nl}When he did, the soldiers reacted strangely. {nl}There was supposed to be an ecstatic winner and disappointed losers, but nobody seemed joyful nor disappointed. Instead, everyone had a bewildered look on their faces. {nl}
Modestas, perplexed by their reaction, asked for an explanation to which one of the soldiers answered, {nl}'We originally had votes for four goddesses but your choice isn't any of them, so now we have five goddesses.' {nl}The soldiers then resumed their squabble about how to decide the winner. {nl}
The mood began to deteriorate so Modestas wanted to leave. {nl}When he was about to take off, the soldiers blocked his path and accused him. {nl}'It's your fault the argument heated up even more. You're not thinking of just leaving are you?'{nl}Intimidated by the irritated soldiers, Modestas dared not to escape. {nl}
In Modestas' mind, he concluded that the quarrelling soldiers didn't have him referee, but simply added him into the bet. In reality however, he had no real claim, so he wasn't in the bet just yet. {nl}
Knowing Modestas, he could not simply sit on the sidelines watching a big bet grow. Eventually, he became enticed to join. Modestas, caught in the heat of the moment and ending up participating, finally remembered it was his turn to lose.{nl}But it was too late.{nl}
In addition, because the other soldiers had already bet deeply, Modestas had to bet the only gold bullion he had. {nl}
If you think about it, even if it was not his turn to lose, all it took for him do so was one more vote for any of the goddesses he didn't choose. With the odds of the next person walking by supporting his goddess being against him, the probability of winning was low anyway.{nl}{nl}However, the victor was chosen unexpectedly. An officer found the soldiers slacking, disciplined them and was about to lead them away. {nl}The soldiers, obeying the superior's command, were about to march off when they shrewdly asked him which goddess he favored. {nl}
The officer inadvertently said the name of a goddess, and some of the soldiers began cheering. {nl}The officer, not knowing what was going on, simply ordered his soldiers to move along. In any case, Modestas certainly lost. {nl}
Having now lost the gold bullion given to him by the strange old woman, Modestas was now at a loss. {nl}To originally intend to referee, only to end up losing all the gold he had, all while knowing exactly the reason why... Modestas felt heartbroken, dumbfounded, and yet, understanding. A unique feeling. {nl}
Although Modestas had just lost money by entering a bet started by others, it was the first time he'd done so in his life. Modestas spent some time thinking of how to better his situation and {nl}suddenly got an idea, knowing he was certain to win his next bet. {nl}
If he could call back the soldiers from earlier and bet his horse, he could certainly earn his gold back and possibly more. {nl}Knowing this, Modestas got on his horse, and sped in the direction the soldiers left towards. {nl}{nl}With speed, Modestas soon spotted a stationary wagon. Modestas lowered his speed to check out the wagon parked on the side of the road. {nl}
Unfortunately, just as Modestas pulled up at the wagon, his horse suddenly grew agitated, forcing him off. Fortunately, because he had cut his speed and fell on muddy ground, he was not greatly injured. {nl}
Someone approached Modestas who had been lying down, hurt, and helped him get back on his feet. He turned out to be one of the people standing on the side, the wagon owner. {nl}The man who helped Modestas uttered with relief, {nl}'I am glad you're not too hurt. Your horse also didn't hurt himself tripping over that pit.'{nl}Modestas noticed a well-hidden pit where he pointed. {nl}The wagon owner continued.{nl}
'My horse became injured here and can no longer pull my wagon. It's just an empty wagon, but at any rate, it won't be going anywhere for a while. That's why I have a proposition. Won't you sell me your horse? I believe, with a healthy horse pulling the wagon, even my injured horse can help pull it in some way.'{nl}
It was an unexpected suggestion, but Modestas needed the horse to quickly find and catch up to the soldiers. He immediately refused the offer.{nl}The wagon owner tried to explain there was no way his injured horse can pull the wagon alone, but Modestas was not persuaded. After his repeated refusal, the wagon owner offered a new suggestion.{nl}'Then let's do this. What if you buy my wagon? I will sell it for cheap. Since my injured horse can't pull the wagon, it will be better off in your hands.'{nl}
Modestas could see that the wagon was very durable, good-looking and has been well cared for. However, he had no immediate need for a wagon, so he hesitated. {nl}In addition, Modestas had no money now; no matter how low the wagon owner went, he did not have the money to buy it. {nl}
The human heart sure can be an amusing thing. {nl}Modestas, deciding the wagon was worth buying but lacking the money to do so, decided he could use his impending victory to win the wagon for free. {nl}So he proposed a bet with the wagon master, risking his own horse. {nl}Naturally, Modestas won. {nl}
Modestas, having now just won a wagon and an injured horse, originally intended to keep just the wagon and his original horse. {nl}But seeing as the injured horse wasn't as injured as he thought, he believed he had won big. {nl}
In his mind, now that he'd had obtained two horses and a wagon, he believed he was no longer in a bad situation, deciding this time to be very careful not to lose big next. {nl}So, instead of following the soldiers, he decided to go to a place where there was less people. He reined his horse and traveled away from civilization. {nl}However, even in a remote setting, he was bound to meet others. {nl}
Rare as it would be, Modestas, while moving about in a uninhabited mountain, encountered an elderly Alchemist. {nl}The old Alchemist sat on a chair on the right side of the road, a silver nugget in hand. {nl}As Modestas passed by for a closer look, the nugget turned out to not be of silver, but of lead. {nl}
'Could this Alchemist be one who could turn lead into gold?' thought Modestas, but soon thought he was just overestimating the Alchemist. {nl}But the Alchemist, glad to see someone pass by after a long time, called out to Modestas, and suddenly proposed a bet with him. Somehow, the whole world today seemed to want to make bets with Modestas, and he was getting tired of it. {nl}Modestas liked gambling, but to find opponents this easily was becoming a joke to him. {nl}
Modestas was about to do something unlike his being and reject the bet, but the idea that he could wager low moved his mind. {nl}After all, the old Alchemist was wagering a lead nugget. {nl}
Because he was certain to lose this time, Modestas believed it would be better to wager and lose against a lead nugget now than to run into people who would wager a large amount of money, and lose later. {nl}Modestas first made sure that he could accept the bet despite having no money at hand and could bring some later, and accepted the bet. No words need to be said about the result. {nl}
However, right as the bet was settled, the lead nugget prize let out a sparkle and, in a moment, clearly became gold. {nl}The Old Alchemist now snickered, 'Now you owe me one gold nugget. Be sure to bring it.' {nl}Modestas protested, but as much as he looked, what the old Alchemist now held was clearly no longer lead. {nl}
Instead, it was clearly gold, so in the end Modestas had bet and lost against a gold nugget. {nl}A now-tired Modestas ultimately had no way of objecting to the Alchemist. {nl}
Now, Modestas had lost more gold than he owed the strange old woman. {nl}And now, he only had one unconditional victory and defeat left. {nl}As Modestas lead his wagon through the rest of the mountain path, he murmured about having to make sure his next win was a very big one. {nl}
'This time, no matter what, I have to wage a bet against the world's richest - well maybe not the richest - but a wealthy man at the least.'{nl}As soon as he uttered these words, his surroundings shook like an earthquake and a heavy, deep voice declared.{nl}'I am the richest in this region.'{nl}
Modestas scanned his surroundings but failed to find anyone. So he asked,{nl}'Who are you?'{nl}The deep, heavy voice answered his question.{nl}'I am where you stand. In your tongue, I am called the mountain.'{nl}Modestas, in disbelief, couldn't help but talk back.{nl}
You are... the mountain?'{nl}'That is correct. I am the mountain, and just as you are looking for, the richest around here.'{nl}'You are the mountain? Well, no, even if you are the mountain, how can you claim to be the richest?'{nl}'I own much land, for my sierra stretches far. Further in me, I contain large, valuable lodes.'{nl}
Hearing about the mountain's valuable lodes revived Modestas' habit. He even knew that this time, he was certain to win. Modestas started persuading the self-proclaiming mountain to make a bet with him. The mountain, unconcerned over winning or losing this bet, agreed. {nl}
For a person to have a fateful encounter with a mysterious being like this, even Modestas doubted his own sanity. {nl}In any case, Modestas bet against the mountain's ores, and won.{nl}
At the end of the bet, the mountain erupted, and a large boulder landed directly in front of Modestas. It was certainly something, but the boulder didn't seem to be what Modestas expected. For the mountain, this was the gambling debt repaid. {nl}In Modestas' eyes however, there should have been veins of gold, or at least something useful, like copper or coal. {nl}
Even if the mountain's veins contained nothing but rocks, he thought he could end up owning a large quarry to dig out valuable stones. Instead, the mountain had paid an inadequate reward.{nl}When Modestas pointed it out, the mountain disagreed. {nl}'All you own are two horses and a wagon.'
'Surely one must wage things of equal value. This boulder is worth as much as you own.'{nl}With that said, the mountain returned to its former self, never to deal with Modestas nor anyone else ever again. {nl}Modestas, in his desperate situation, had wasted his crucial chance just to win one big boulder.{nl}Despite his bad luck, he consoled himself by knowing at least he had horses and a wagon to transport the boulder.{nl}
And then suddenly, anxiety struck him. He realized that, although he has an unconditional loss upcoming, given the strange things that happened up to now, he would not be able to easily control the outcome of the final bet. {nl}Nonetheless, Modestas knew he couldn't stay where he was right now, and decided to leave. {nl}
Modestas got up and tried to move the boulder, but to no avail. It was simply too large for him to handle by himself. {nl}He considered leaving it behind, but after recalling the mountain's saying that the boulder was worth more than his two horses and wagon combined, he believed that would be a waste. {nl}Supposing he could sell the boulder to a local quarry for a good amount of money, he became troubled and unable to leave. {nl}
In front of Modestas, who had been worrying, appeared a familiar figure. It was none other than the one who had started the bet - the suspicious old woman.{nl}The old woman questioned Modestas.{nl}'How is it? Is it going well?'{nl}
Modestas confessed he was far from making profits; instead he was in debt, wasted all his chances to win, and only had his last, losing bet remaining.{nl}After listening to his story the old woman responded flatly, {nl}'Since you only have one bet left, go ahead and make your last losing bet. Then all that's left for you to do is pay up your end of the bargain for losing the bet against me.'{nl}Modestas was a man who loved to gamble, but he was not the type to throw a tantrum, nor was he a sore loser.
Modestas knew these gambles were more than just about money. {nl}Modestas, a dedicated gambler, nodded along with the woman's words. He clearly looked to be a man with a huge burden, his facial expression dark. {nl}The old woman could sense Modestas' thoughts, so she made this proposal. {nl}
'Since you are unsure how to transport this boulder you suddenly won, how about this? Normally, I wouldn't change the initial conditions, but for my amusement I will give you a suggestion. Why don't you use your last bet to see whether or not I can lift this boulder up into your wagon? Even if you lose, at least you can have this heavy boulder loaded on your wagon.'{nl}
Modestas who had nothing to lose, nodded his head to accept her proposal. But before he could consent to the bet, the old woman continued. {nl}'But I can't just give you such a favorable idea for free. Therefore I will add one more condition.'{nl}
When Modestas asked about the condition, the old woman answered.{nl}'You are to take the boulder, which I will load onto the wagon, to Klaipeda. Then, turn it into an object of value which everyone will recognize and esteem. If you are successful, then the punishment for losing the bet against me will become void. Your friends will not disappear. Although this is difficult, I will still give you one more chance since you've already lost the bet. How about it?'{nl}Like always, Modestas had no choice.
The moment Modestas agreed to the proposal, the old woman pointed her finger past him. {nl}Modestas turned around and to his surprise, the boulder he had trouble with was effortlessly placed on the wagon. By the time Modestas looked forward again, the old woman had already disappeared. {nl}
Because Modestas had no ropes or equipment to secure the boulder onto the wagon, he had to lean the wagon and carefully drive it to Klaipeda. {nl}On his way to Klaipeda, he again met the soldiers who he had earlier bet against. Their commanding officer was now aware of what had happened thus far, and wanted to apologize to Modestas for getting him caught up and hurt in his subordinates' affairs. {nl}
The officer returned Modesta's gold to him, and ordered his soldiers to help him transport the boulder back to Klaipeda. {nl}
The officer and solders had sturdy rope, so they were able to transport the rock without worry of it falling off and unload it at Klaipeda. They decided to accompany Modestas all the way there. {nl}Modestas was very grateful for the help. {nl} Along with the soldiers, Modestas again ran into none other than the Alchemist he had lost earlier against.
To Modestas, a promise was a promise, so he immediately handed over the gold the soldiers returned to him to the Alchemist. {nl}The Alchemist, surprised by how Modestas could do this with no complaints or dissatisfaction, took the gold and conversed with him.
Not wanting to be left out of the conversation between Modestas and the Alchemist, the soldiers couldn't continue working, joined in, and learned about the Alchemist's past with Modestas. {nl}The Alchemist apologized to Modestas for turning his lead into gold, and promised to gather all the support he could for Modestas at Klaipeda. He then left. {nl}
Soon after, Modestas and the soldiers reached Klaipeda. They set the stone down at the large open space at the center of town. {nl}
When the boulder was set in its proper place with the help of the soldiers, the Alchemist who had left returned with another person. The Alchemist had brought with him a famous Dievdirbys.{nl}To the Dievdirbys, the Alchemist suggested, {nl}'Why don't you sculpt a statue of a goddess using this boulder, on this central site of Klaipeda? If this boulder is changed into a statue of a goddess, then nobody in Klaipeda will be able to deny its significance. I think that will fulfill your promise to the old woman.'{nl}
Everyone who was there favored the idea on the spot. {nl}The Alchemist took the gold he obtained from Modestas and paid it to the Dievdirbys as commission, and went to get permission from the Knight Commander and Bishop of Klaipeda.{nl}
As news spread, everyone in Klaipeda was pleased to know a Goddess Statue was planned for their city. {nl}However, one last problem remained, asides from winning their favor. And that question was, which goddess should the statue commemorate? {nl}The soldiers who gave help transporting the boulder were especially passionate about this issue, and began quarrelling again. {nl}
The one who answered this question was none other than Modestas. {nl}Without any real intent, Modestas argued that the goddesses in power have guided him via divine providence to build a statue at Klaipeda that day. {nl}
That the old woman appeared before him, that the many bets occurred, that the mountain erupted a stone for material was the divine providence of the goddesses, argued Modestas, persuading everyone. {nl}Thus, the people decided to follow the words of Modestas, and Modestas relayed to the Dievdirbys the order to create the statue. {nl}When the statue was finally finished, the citizens of Klaipeda gathered, curious to know the identity of the goddess who had been raised in the center of their beloved city.{nl}
However, to their bewilderment, not a single soul could recognize the goddess whom the completed statue commemorated.{nl}
The Dievdirbys who had sculpted the statue had already vanished deep into the Kateen Forest, so the citizens of Klaipeda repeatedly questioned Modestas for her name. {nl}Despite the numerous questions, nobody received an answer from Modestas. {nl}At any rate, this is the story of how the Goddess Statue of Klaipeda came to be. Even now that statue stands in the center of Klaipeda.{nl}
And so, some people believed Modestas, having undertaken the goddesses' intervention, was an honest man who did not gamble. In reality, Modestas didn't stop making gambles until his death. {nl}
Ever since then, whenever Modestas took on a wager, he always bet the same thing: the answer to the question of who the Statue of Klaipeda honored.{nl}To uncover the name of the goddess, numerous people challenged Modestas to a bet.{nl} {nl}But no matter the impossible odds, Modestas never lost a bet. Nobody was able to win the answer from Modestas for years, and time flew by.{nl}
Though Modestas died an undefeated, invincible gambler, he had never bet anything other than the goddess' identity, living purely off the profits gained from such bets through the end of his life. {nl}
In the end, this unknown goddess, in exchange for giving a livelihood to a certain gambler from Klaipeda, created an interesting, mysterious, yet beautiful statue for the city of Klaipeda, and a tale to last for times to come.{nl}{nl}

Now go to Gintara Highway in Sirdgela Forest. {nl}Spray this potion on the Matsum dolls I placed there and tell me what happens. 
Four scouts were sent to Sirdgela Forest not too long ago but all of them went missing. {nl}Maybe they took the Thorn Forest too lightly... {nl}Please find their whereabouts.
I no longer have the strength to carry on, but will write this for anyone who has made it past this area. {nl}Naktis... it's funny that I yearn for a curse on the Monarch of Curses.
Naktis scattered cursed Tree Root Crystals in the area. {nl}To stop the curse, they must be destroyed.
Perhaps I shall soon lose my breath. {nl}Pilgrims, may the blessings of the goddess be with you!
Please be sure to find the scripture! {nl}One of the pilgrim souls entrapped in here must have it.
All pilgrims should offer different amounts.
This is not a reasonable amount.
Worship the Goddess Statue to receive blessings or move on to another area.
What a nasty curse. {nl}Let's see which is stronger. Naktis' curse or the goddess' purifier.
Of course I have the purifier. {nl}But I'm not giving it to you unless you offer me money.
It could be the one who stole the gypsum carving of the Goddess Statue, so get rid of the monsters there. {nl}If my hunch is right, then Naktis must be behind it. {nl} It might be far away, but I just heard that.
Naktis is looking for a clue to enter the Cathedral. {nl}If I'm right, not only has the Forest of Prayer been affected, but all of the Pilgrim's Way. {nl}Revelator, if you reach the Cathedral, please defeat Naktis. {nl}You must stop the goddess' revelation from falling into demon hands.
This place is dying. {nl}All the Tree Root Crystals have mutated.
Some Tree Root Crystals are useless unless burned. {nl}Some even fume at the core.
We must do whatever it takes to turn it back but... {nl}It's all so tiring now...
I feel like I'm drowning. {nl}The Tree Root Crystal is slowly killing me.
Do whatever it takes to destroy it... {nl}Please help.
I've lost all desire. Am I dying now? {nl}Eating and even breathing feels meaningless.
But it must go on. {nl}Unless that cursed Tree Root Crystal is destroyed...
There are things that Witas cares about. {nl}Won't he get his mind back if you show him those? 
Somebody's Diary
Those brothers are crazy. They must be completely nuts. {nl}When did it start? When Dora attacked Gracius? {nl}When they saw the demons marching?
Things have gone to hell since Gracius was incapacitated. {nl}From the very beginning, while I kept my mouth shut, everyone lusted for bloodshed. {nl}The town was like a volcano waiting to erupt. {nl}I thought it was an educational experience until then.
Then something snapped. {nl}A fellow clergyman, I can't remember who, had murdered Dion in his sleep with a mace and I... {nl}Everyone... {nl}No one could remember why they wanted to become a priest anymore.
This surely is not a teaching of Sir Maven. {nl}Greed? Laziness? How can we call killing one another, 'teaching a lesson'? {nl}I even envy Dion for dying first.
I can hear snickering somewhere. {nl}It could be the sound of Dora deceiving me. {nl}It doesn't really matter any more.
The trapped spirit gave you a scripture and disappeared.
You endured Witas' curse thanks to the medicine.
If you ever see the Devout Tree, please bring it back to life. {nl}I've heard that tree can block the power of the curse.
I believe that the evil will eventually fall and the goddess will be victorious. {nl}The mark of victory is right in front of me.
Anyway, I will go to the battlegrounds first, so please help the Watchers and my followers. {nl}I will see you at Nefritas Cliff.
This isn't over yet. {nl}I'll be watching you from Kvailas Forest.
Catacomb 1F Interior Warp
It needs to be purified more...
Blurry Spirit of Catacomb 1F
Something murky is lurking around...
Something once invisible is appearing...
Letter Someone Left Behind
The Tree Root Crystals of Pilgrim's Way are cursed by Naktis, {nl}as if to mock Sir Maven's teachings against laziness. 
It should be destroyed before the curse spreads. {nl}However, I cannot handle the Tree Root Crystals alone. 
Souls of Pilgrims swallowed by the monsters can destroy the Tree Root Crystal. {nl}Maybe I, too, will be one of them soon.
Notice for Pilgrims
This is the Pilgrim's Way that leads to the Great Cathedral. {nl}Maven, the first Archbishop of the Great Cathedral, left teachings on each of the five Pilgrim's Ways.
They warn against the five deadly sins of mankind. {nl}Pilgrims heading to the Great Cathedral should reflect on these teachings. 
The Starving Demon's Way is for Gluttony. {nl}Throw away your obsession for food and start your pilgrimage with reverence. 
The Pilgrim's Way is for Sloth. {nl}You mustn't be indolent during the long journey to Cathedral.
The Altar Way is for Wrath. {nl}Excessive rage impoverishes the soul.
The Forest of Prayer is for Deceit. {nl}You cannot reach the goddess with a deceitful heart.
The Apsimesti Crossroads is for Envy. {nl}Compose yourself so that you won't fall into bewilderment.
Tree of Faith
The Tree of Faith. {nl}Like the power of the goddess, its branches block evil curses. 
Pilgrims who pass by this road, {nl}if ever the pond is corrupted, pour sap from the Tree of Brothers.
Tree of Brothers Notice
First Tree of the Brothers. {nl}Guard the Tree of Faith with the name of the goddess.
Second Tree of the Brothers. {nl}Purify the evil force with the power of the goddess.
Third Tree of the Brothers. {nl}Live a full life with the grace of the goddess.
Spoiled already? Here, take this.
The magic circle is shaking.
Baron Allerno
Wait, I came to see if the device is working well, but isn't my territory quiet and great to live in? There aren't that many people though. 
I wonder when the explorers will return from the Closed Area...
It's just one thing that the old man wants.
This machine takes too many crops. You can say it was kept because of my prestige and morality. 
Haven't you heard the saying that not even the king can save poverty? What do they expect me to do? 
I have a talented wizard for the deity. But he's busy right now, so I can't bring him here. 
Hmm, goddess? You mean the goddess? 
I wonder if the tenant farmers know that it is all thanks to me that they can eat and live like this. 
Youngsters nowadays don't have enough spirit in them. {nl}When I was their age, people would volunteer to go into these mysterious places ahead of others! {nl}Now they won't do anything unless something is offered in return. They just don't have passion.
Everlasting thing... everlasting beauty...
Something that looks like the head of a statue is buried. 
Better check out this liquor barrel.
Something that looks like the wing of a statue is buried. 
Farmer
Okay, that'll be only 1,000 silver coins then.
Great! It's a deal!
Then don't. Pfft.
You're a bum.
Here. You're more pathetic than I am...
Ah, what's up? 
Farming alone keeps me busy.
I'm not sure yet... about that... rebellion.
It's enticing, but...
Do you have a written letter of Horacius? 
No wonder! Here you go.
I can't just give my precious farming tools to someone so suspicious!
Huh? Why should I trust you? 
You're very persistent. Here.
I wonder how well the preparations are going.
Go away.
Can't you see I'm busy? Go away. 
So what? 
I'll actively cooperate.
Our rebellion will be successful. We can't be exploited like this any more.
Ah, really? Then I should give.
The exploitation became too much at some point... There's no generosity any more.
Then give us some silver.
Here you go. Use it well. Everyone, cheer up!
What do you want?
Someone's even more pathetic than me...
Beats me. I'll just give it to you.
What are they talking about? The baron is hiding something...?
There is no such thing as a rest day for a farmer. 
I'm busy. Come back later.
Don't bother me.
Then, I will sign the petition if you pay 10,000 silver.
I've never met anyone as generous as you! So kind! Hahaha! Take this!
What a penniless bum. Go away.
That's some persistence you've got. Fine. I don't really trust you but I'll sign for Horacius' sake.
Oh, it's you... Hmm, the petition of Horacius... finally! The day of Rebellion is coming. I'll sign it.
Did you put the tools to good use last time? A petition? Sure, I'll sign it. For victory!
Let me read the details of the petition.
Oh, alright. Here, let me sign.
How can I trust someone who does not trust me? 
What is it? Are you a fraud? 
You're persistent... Here's my signature.
Later. I'm busy right now.
Rebellion or not, life itself is not easy for me... Give me something if you want to say things like that. 
Oh, thank you. Here's my signature. 
How stingy. I'll have to be stingy as well then.
Tsk, tsk. You're as cheap as I am.
Sigh... Okay. I can't do that. Here's the signature. 
I'm very busy right now so come back later.
My signature for the petition? You think I'd just give it to you? No. At least pay me for it or something...
Aha, now we're talking. Let me sign that. For the rebellion!
Is this a joke...
What kind of big plan could a bum come up with?
You've got some persistence. Here's my signature. 
I can't just take a break from farming. I'm busy right now.
Do you have around 15,000 silver? Show some sincerity...
Wow, thank you. My signature is all yours. Horacius really does good work!
Then I'm busy too.
Even if you're busy, you should take care of yourself. You're broke.
I'll just do it for Horacius' sake. 
Come back later. I'm resting.
The plan of Horacius? You must be talking about that thing. I knew this day would come. I'll definitely give you my signature. 
I am just waiting for the day of the rebellion.
I don't even have enough money for my sick family... I don't care about the rebellion!
Oh my, thank you! I'll definitely be joining the rebellion. 
Someone, somewhere, is gulping down food while I don't even have money to feed my family... 
You and I are both poor. We can't think of anything else while we're starving.
Okay. I'll sign it so you'll stop bugging me.
I'm dizzy. Come back later.
Can we finally get to sleep in peace? If so, I'll gladly sign that!
I believe things will soon get better.
I just signed...
Hauberk's Introduction
Demons kidnapped by Vakarine and those kicked out of the demonic world have gathered here. {nl}It's a place where vicious criminals are constantly preying on us. 
Ready? Another group will be coming soon.
Demon Lord Hauberk
You must have a lot of questions. Ask, Revelator...
Vakarine is fighting Valtrus in the Demon Prison across the portal. {nl}She won't be able hold it for much longer unless someone helps.
Men under the command of the Baron have been here, though they weren't able to make it back. {nl}I watched everything with the wizard's eyes. {nl}Even the screams of Vakarine and her Kupoles.
That depends on whether or not you have the will to save the goddess. {nl}We can take time to talk about it. 
The limbs of Nuaele were all cut off. {nl}Now go find Aldona. {nl}She will take you and Hauberk to Nuaele's territory.
We will be entering Nuaele's territory now. {nl}Prepare yourself.
Once Nuaele is gone, we'll be able to fight the demons easily- even with only the Kupoles. 
Our biggest problem aside from the corruption breach was Nuaele. {nl}Now we can focus on the former. {nl}Go to Prison District 3. The goddess awaits your support.
Keep your guard up. {nl}This may be the secret to the last key, but the demons are still watching.
You will enter a special room once you get all five keys of Maven. {nl}In there, you will be tested to see if you're eligible for the revelation.
The number of candles is important. But for this secret, you must remember the order of the candles as well. {nl}It is similar to the first secret.
The device is operating.
A few manic farmers assaulted the people. 
Guards are working hard to protect the farm. {nl}Help them. 
I thank you again in the name of fate. {nl}From here on, I will follow the stars to find Goddess Ausrine.
Thanks to you, the seal of Uskis Arable Land is now stable. {nl}However, many other Revelators have lost their consciousness to the evil energy at the Spring Light Woods.
This most glorious Great Cathedral was built 660 years ago under the guide of Archbishop Silvestro Maven.
I can still hear it. {nl}The priests' prayers filling the kingdom. {nl}The endless march of pilgrims coming for the grace of the goddess.
It was like that until four years ago. {nl}Before the curse surrounded the Great Cathedral on Medzio Diena...
Candlestick
No candlesticks are lit. 
I buried Dallas. {nl}His death pains me so much.
More monsters! Run!
You were running so hard for me. {nl}Why don't you give me the key, kid? 
The breach of corruption, once open, will continue to expand. {nl}Revelator, please help Vakarine as soon as possible. 
There seems to be some reaction in the platform of benevolence. 
Bishop Ilam
Bishop Aurelius, who was ordained at a young age, soon took ill and lost his life.
His last request was for the Divine Mission for Maven to be fulfilled even after his death and the Church accepted.
Nature of the Curse
Gluttony, Wrath, Sloth...{nl}The nature of all curses that affect{nl}mankind is obsession.{nl}It makes the spirits of the dead prefer staying behind as opposed to going to the goddess. 
The difference is that it is the will of the dead that keeps the spirit behind {nl}while curses are forced upon by others onto you.
Naturally, priests learning the teachings of the goddess are not permitted to use it unless it's for experiments.
My Mission 1
Even if the Revelator gets the revelation in his hands, {nl}it's useless if it can't be protected.
The purpose of my secret is not only to protect the revelation from evil but also to prevent the greed of weak Revelators.
May you wander in the everlasting fog of the unknown if you recklessly approach without realizing my intentions.
My Mission 2
Those who challenge the Holy Mission won't just try to gently unravel the secret. {nl}Because of that, I had to plan many secrets and take measures against such barbaric actions.
To obey my secret. {nl}That is the only way to earn the legacy of the goddess.
Sign Commemorating the Completion of the Great Cathedral
The goddess of this land will build a church. {nl}The forces of evil can never invade this sanctuary. {nl} - Est. Year 434, Silvestro Maven
Memo Someone Left Behind
The highest steeple of the church also fell on Medzio Diena. {nl}The grief and sorrow of the evacuation march was indescribable.
On the day we prayed to the goddess that we would return, everyone cried tears of outrage. {nl}Our church will never succumb to the evil curse.
(There are many books left on the shelf. Which one shall we read?)
Dusty Book
(There is a dusty book with a memo on the chair. Which one shall we read?)
It was really dangerous a while ago. {nl}If you were any later, we would never have seen the third key.
If you use the symbol of spirits, you can see the area where spirits will be absorbed. {nl}Defeat the demons there and their evil force will be absorbed into the symbol.
Once the Symbol of Spiritual Power is charged, go to Veinika Altar. {nl}Insert the symbol in the Veinika altar and you will receive the third key of Maven.
The medicine should work.
The key is at Gaule Altar. {nl}I think you should leak that much information to Naktis' servants.
Of course, you'll need to use the transformation scroll before doing so. 
The secret supposedly unveils upon application of a holy force, {nl}but the trap will activate regardless if it detects an evil force.
The plan is to get the key after exhausting that trap using Naktis' servants.
Naktis' servants will be punished for prying on Maven's secret. {nl}Use that opportunity to get the key.
Even if the goddess condemns me for this... I will hold my head high,{nl} because it was for the protection of the revelation.
Did you find the last key?
This sanctuary is a treasure house of knowledge. {nl}You need to master the fundamentals of everything to protect the kingdom,{nl}and the revelation in the name of the goddess. 
Studying the demons is no exception.
The monarch of curses, Naktis... {nl}She has not shown herself yet, but I'm sure she's somewhere inside the sanctuary.
Perhaps she's waiting for us to get all the keys.
I am honored to be able to now guide you to the hidden room.
Focus on the colors of the orbs. {nl}You should insert the key in orbs of the same color.
Of course it is impossible to press down both footrests alone. {nl}You can use the wood chunks the demons scattered around... or ask colleagues for help. 
Coincidentally, I heard an eyewitness account from a refugee from this area. {nl}He asked for the safety of his family when I was being sent here... {nl}But I can't see any member of the Greene family, just refugees and monsters. 
And I found this mysterious seedling. {nl}Unlike others, we can feel a mysterious force from these. {nl}I can't identify this force in detail... {nl}But I'm sure it can purify evil.
We would have known better if Master was here. {nl}At any rate, we have to test if this seedling actually has the power to purify. {nl}I will do a simple purifying ritual. {nl}Get me some Ellom Leaves to grasp the pollution status of this area. 
Now, let's start. {nl}Please watch together. 
But he is a druid who has accomplished as much as I have. {nl}I think he can find out what the secret of this seedling is.
Also, you may experience something unusual if you have this twig. {nl}If you do, please tell him about it too.
Please find my colleague in Shaton Farm.
Aren't the dandelions around pretty? {nl}They disservice me, however, by sucking nutrients from the ground. {nl}If this continues, we won't be having a wheat harvest next season. {nl}Please remove the dandelions from the farm. 
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh? 
We're fighting hard. {nl}My mens' injuries are far more urgent than the farmers, wouldn't you agree? {nl}But some druid provided medicine only to the farmers which they then hid away. {nl}I have no words...
It's simple. I will look out for my men first. {nl}Bring me the medicine that they've hidden. It shouldn't be hard to find. {nl}Probably in some wooden box or grape wagon, possibly an empty house... Somewhere there.
But be careful. {nl}If this bowl fills with water, the spell will fume a special force. {nl}Then the monsters attracted to that force might attack. 
It was successful. {nl}Did you know these seeds are the same type as the mysterious seedlings? {nl}Seems like a wide range of land can be purified if it's grown well enough.
Growing these will use up parts of the cultivated farm however. {nl}The landlord of the farm in the reservoir area, Shaton, {nl}is here just in time so I should try persuading him while I can.
I'll meet you in the reservoir area. 
Soldier Mike
My parent passed away on Medzio Diena because of them. {nl}I applied as a soldier here for my parents' revenge. {nl}But... it's a shame. I can't even so much as look at them. {nl}Please, do me a favor and kill them for me!
They'll jump out when you approach the bush and more'll come out if you shake it. {nl}You're partly responsible for it so you should help.
There was a young couple that used to work here. They were very diligent. {nl}Everyone here did not work hard because they hated Shaton but they were different. 
But that Shaton abused and exploited them. {nl}They ended up dying of overwork. I have some of their keepsakes... {nl}I promised to bury it near the grave but I lost the bag I kept them in in the chaos of Medzio Diena. {nl}If you find an old bag, please check if there's a ring inside. 
Good. This potion cost me a fortune at the Fedimian Black Market. {nl}It was from an elementalist who seemed trustworthy, unlike those druids. {nl}According to him, this potion contains the essence of alchemy. 
He said if I pour this on the ground, a powerful obedient monster will appear. {nl}I'll use it to wipe out all the monsters in my farm!
Well, I've made some mistakes here and there but who doesn't? {nl}I mean, just look at grapes. How can you use water without wine mixed as drinking water? {nl}Even if the world is ending, you can't just drink plain water. That's barbaric! {nl}Hmm! Anyway, I appreciate the help. I'll listen to your story.
I'm just listening! I'm not going to do what you say! {nl}I don't think wheat will grow here no matter what kind of magic you use. {nl}I need to look for my son's body, so you better keep it short!
The wandering girl the farmers mentioned sounds suspicious. {nl}Elly agrees with me too. {nl}Looking at the facts together with her actions, we can't just dismiss her as an ordinary girl. {nl}Won't people in the Shaton family do anything about it? 
And Medzio Diena came a few years after. {nl}My family barely made it out alive and this is what happened to the farm. {nl}That's not all. {nl}It was mentioned that a blue disaster will follow the great disaster.
Think about it, it may have been a warning about those poisonous grapes. {nl}The true gold blessing will come after the blue disaster passes. I don't know what that means. {nl}I wanted to talk to her more but her father kicked her out saying she felt ominous. {nl}Where could she be wandering now...
Thank you. {nl}Maybe we earned some of the master's trust. {nl}If so, then it's all thanks to you. {nl}Good luck...
I heard things went well at the Shaton Farm. {nl}That's a relief. I will discuss with the master about the large-scale purification and how to make it successful.
Thank you. This will help many people recover.
It's a task of getting rid of the Lauzinutes across the underground tunnel. {nl}The owner's son disappeared in the underground tunnel long ago. It's creepy and I don't ever want to go in there. 
Good. My men need to defend this area. {nl}It was spotted in the upper area. I'll mark the map for you. {nl}You might have to go through some underground tunnels. 
Underground Tunnel
(I can't seem to go the opposite way.)
Is Vieta Gorge a masterpiece of the goddess or a marvel of nature? {nl}The limestone stairway in the southern area is shining with spring water and looks fantastic.
You shouldn't trust anyone in here. Not the goddess and not even yourself.
Hauberk, the goddess has no intentions of fighting against you. {nl}Cease your hostility.
Valtrus...
Go back there!
Prepare to make the Evening Star Key. {nl}Hurry, we don't have much time. I'll be sending the Revelator soon.
I will not let my soul be tricked by you any more!
What is this... {nl}What are you trying to do with my soul!?
Srautas Canyon is filled with evil forces and the demons have begun to attack. {nl}Guards and Paladin followers are defending against them but they desperately need your help.
Strange things are happening in Vejo Ravine. {nl}All the villagers disappeared and monsters took their place.
Monsters entered the Stele Road and are blocking the way. {nl}All towns and villages will be isolated if we don't get rid of the monsters.
We need support to make our way from the Dvasia Peak to Gateway of Great King. {nl}Please help.

It's spoiled. {nl}Take it again.
Oh, that stench. Throw it away first then come back.
Ugh. How can you eat that? You should bring the fresh one.
The sealing magic circle must be enhanced to suppress the strange force surrounding this area.
I must join in doing the righteous thing.
I just gave it a while ago...
He seems dizzy. Is the medicine working?
Seems like the hunger went away.
You must be full of questions right now. Ask away, Revelator...
Vakarine is fighting Valtrus in the Demon Prison across the portal. {nl}She won't be able hold it for much longer unless someone helps.
Men under the command of the Baron have been here though they weren't able to make it back. {nl}I watched everything with the wizard's eyes. {nl}Even the screams of Vakarine and her Kupoles.
That depends on whether or not you have the will to save the goddess. {nl}We can take time to talk about it. 
I hear the demons that crossed the corruption breach are gathered in Ausros Chapel. {nl}I wish you luck in the name of the goddess. 
Royal Mausoleum Construction Fee
Those who kept the honor of King Zachariel and his descendants built the King's grave here.

Sealing the spell.
The powerful spell can be suppressed using a fragment of the Spell Suppressing Crystal. 
Demon Lord Naktis
You have been running around hard in my land. {nl}Sorry kid, but my name calls for the curse.
What is this...? {nl}What are you doing with my soul?!
Reconstruction of Blessings
You think so too, huh? {nl}Please collect some leather. You can get some from the monsters. 
Then give me 1,000 silver coins. I'm in a tight spot here too.
I'm very sorry but I do hope you understand.
Then I have no business with you
You're even worse than me.
Even more pathetic than I am... Take it.
What is it? 
But you're a new face. {nl}Do you have anything to prove that you're Horacius' colleague?
No wonder! Here it is.
I can't just give my precious farming tools to someone so suspicious!
Huh? Why should I trust you? 
You're very persistent. Here.
Is Horacius really okay?
I don't know who you are but I am very busy.
What happens if it fails? 
If it's just that then I'll cooperate. {nl}Will farming tools be enough? 
Of course I should give them. {nl}It'll be successful.
Is that not enough?
Necklace of Shaton
I found an old, blood stained necklace. Could this be Shaton's son's necklace?

It's the reverting chain that shredded my soul... I collected my soul with it.
Seems the plan was to block the corruption breach with my soul. {nl}Good thing I knew about it before it was too late. 
Did you really think you could fool me that easily? {nl}Send my regards to Vakarine.
Hand it over, Revelator. {nl}The goddess will take care of it.

I offer the Goddess Statue of Soul my honor and light. 
Ugh. How can you eat that? You should bring ones that aren't spoiled.
Good, good. The purification is going well. {nl}Welcome to my territory, Revelator. 
The purification? Ah... yes, it's ongoing. {nl}This is all for the farmers as long as that engine works well.
This old man wants just one thing: {nl}beauty, everlasting beauty...
Ah, I'm referring to the engine and purification. 
This machine takes too many crops. {nl}You can say it was kept because of my prestige and morality.
Haven't you seen the weird aura around the farm? {nl}That's what's corrupting the farm.
The spell device is used to suppress the aura by using the magic circles to purify the farm. {nl}It's all the genius of Rimas.
Anyway, when will the search team be back from the restricted area?
Ah, you're still here. {nl}Take your time and look around.
If we fail... Then what will happen to us? 
The farm rent has become a problem. People aren't generous any more. 
It's no joke.
Someone's Memo
This place is insane. {nl}The only way to get rid of this cursed Tree Root Crystal is to burn the place down. {nl}It should all be burned.
The Baron's greed had him send his men into this area. {nl}None of them made it back.
I watched everything through the eyes of this wizard. {nl}Even the screams of Vakarine and her Kupoles. 
That depends on whether or not you have the will to save the goddess. {nl}We can take time later to talk about it. 
Isn't there a more effective way to block the monsters?
Freshly cultivating the farm isn't easy though,{nl}at least there are less monsters than before.
They were once gentle monsters that suddenly grew vicious. {nl}Have you heard of anything else like that? 
Many loved ones would have been lost if not for you. {nl}Why would someone do such a thing?
I'm sure it's a monster behind that man's mask. {nl}Spreading poison? Ebonypawn? I'll remember that.
Weird things happen when you try to cultivate a new farm. {nl}Though nowadays it's even weirder if nothing happens. 
I didn't think we'd lack manpower since we're close to Klaipeda. {nl}I guess that was a mistake on my part. {nl}Well, at least we have enough soldiers to fight the large monsters.
Guarding the farm is tiring enough. {nl}How much time do the soldiers need to explore the Thorn Forest? 
One or two monsters I can handle just fine. {nl}But, I don't think I can handle an entire flock though.
I'm standing guard here. {nl}It's better than the Eastern Woods since there are less monsters{nl}but it isn't exactly easy.
My colleagues' faces turned pale and they ran away. What's going on? 
A Gorgon? Holy... I think I've seen one.
A tremendous monster was sighted here. Have you seen it? 
It's a bit dubious, a monster hiding in a dead end like this. {nl}I can't just ignore the report though...
Crops from here will be brought to Klaipeda. {nl}I heard the farm has been corrupted with an evil energy.
The farm's cultivation just started so I'm the only one who received farmland. {nl}I wonder when they'll cultivate the whole area like this. 
You defeated the Gorgon? {nl}Wow, Revelators must be some sort of superhuman.
One wrong move and we could've been wiped out. {nl}It feels like the goddess has returned and is keeping us safe. 
I could have fought more but my colleagues ran away. {nl}I can take those monsters anytime...
Next time, I'll fight at the front line. {nl}I'm sure I can take it down. 
It would have been dangerous if you weren't around. {nl}Such a big monster near Klaipeda...
Gatus, he was the first to run away but he loves to bluff... {nl}
How could Gytis lie to us? {nl}He said there were only gentle monsters. 
Alan's worse. {nl}He should have correctly said it was Gorgon.
I saw your fight as I ran away and it was spectacular. {nl}Do you fight these kinds of monsters often? 
I really envy you. {nl}I could be a good soldier too if I had your abilities. 
I feel sick... Ugh...
I still feel sick but it's getting better. {nl}Thank you very much. 
You brought the medicine for us? {nl}Thank you. The goddess will surely bless you. 
Hm... Is the antidote ready yet...?
Save me...
If it weren't for you, I'd be meeting the goddess right now. {nl}Thank you very much.
I lost consciousness on something weird that I then knew was poison. {nl}That pain... I don't ever want to think about it again. 
Help... I feel like dying...
Thank you for saving us. {nl}I was sure we were dead.
I suddenly felt hot and... I don't remember anything after that. {nl}Ebonypawn? Never heard of it. 
My stomach's burning...
Go back. {nl}Humans shouldn't enter this place.
We cannot protect you. Go back.
Nuaele's subordinates are all gone. {nl}Go find Aladona. She'll take you to Nuaele's territory. 
Aside from the corruption breach, our biggest problem was Nuaele. {nl}Now we can focus on the corruption breach. {nl}Go to Prison District 3. The goddess awaits your support.
Be prepared. We are establishing a new base.
We will make a home here, a world where both demons and humans meet.
We shall break the wings of the goddess and destroy all the barriers.
Let us expand our forces starting from here.
This will be our land.
Come find me if you have anything to ask.
Among them, the Paladin Master was a hero who saved many lives in the capital. {nl}Currently, he has gone to Silverstream Gorge to fight a great evil.
I don't like Fiona and wonder why she's the Hunter Master. {nl}But, if we need her to defeat Ebonypawn, I'm fine with allying with her.
Cured Tenant Farmer
You saved my life. I still feel sick... I am very grateful to you!
If the grapes keep turning out this way, I'm leaving Shaton Farm. {nl}I don't want to feel this kind of pain any more.
I thought the poison would burn my body. {nl}Thank you very much for saving me.
Storage Keeper Rita
Welcome! {nl}How can I help you?
You shouldn't trust anyone here. Not the goddess and not even yourself.
Demon Lord Hauberk, the goddess does not wish to fight you. {nl}Cease your hostile actions at once.
Prepare to make the Evening Star Key. {nl}Hurry, we don't have much time. I'll be sending the Revelator soon.
My soul is mine, only mine!
I was able to gather my soul thanks to you. {nl}But this... Isn't this the reverting chain that shredded my soul?
Right. Now I understand... {nl}The plan was to close the dimensional crack with the power of my soul?
Give me the power, Revelator. {nl}It is power that only the goddess should take care of.
Receptionist Brandon
The information to share with you is not getting gathered.
It's better to use the cable car than heading straight into the monsters.
You can get to the other end by using the cable car.
Careful! This must be Antares' doing. {nl}It will explode if you go near it. {nl}It's better to get rid of them by luring each of them one by one.
Please protect me as I stabilize the Jewels of Prominence. I need to concentrate.
Okay... Let me see the completed jewel you put so much effort into making. {nl}I don't know about you but I really like it, huhuhu...

They'll destroy and ravage more lives and then absorb them into the Divine Tree. {nl}We can never forgive them. {nl}They themselves should be returned to the Divine Tree.
Sigita's Diary
The demons' filthy bodies fall lifelessly on the wet ground of the Demons' Prison. {nl}They are against us and want to return it to one status.

Unknown Adventurer's Diary
The house of the family cursed with revenge and slaughter welcomed us. {nl}As we stepped into the house, the tangled vines grasped our knees.
We released the seals as we defeated the monsters. {nl}The treasures of Legwyn Family are hidden somewhere in this house... {nl}We will find them. 
Beikeol's Reply
I've received your letter. {nl}It's great to hear that the lads of Legwyn family trusts you.
I've changed the name on this certificate for you so return the rest of documents to me. {nl}I guarantee either his will or his land document.
I'll provide the down payment like last time. {nl}You take care of everything and as well as the daughter of Legwyn who went overseas to study.
Purchase Order
As requested, I am sending you the roots of the aconites that we harvested this spring. {nl}They can make stomachaches, dizziness, and pain go away.
One more thing. Do not consume too much at once, it could be fatal. {nl}Doses should be smaller than the size of a nail and consumed after being melted in liquor.
Watcher's Epitaph
As the wind sways, as the leaves fall down. {nl}If falling down, then as falling down. {nl}When I sing my song, the night would come and the sun would go down.
He rests here after fighting against the herd of evil with the first Paladin.
Born as a son of a Watcher. Completed the construction of the Tenet Church. He rests here.
Mother, please don't cry. {nl}I am finally free of the curse.
Finally, you sleep like you are at your mother's house. {nl}You don't have to worry about the pain any more. {nl}You don't have to wait for the salvation from the goddess.
In the touch of the goddess. Beside the mother. {nl}Sleeping. Having a sleep. {nl}Me, who is not beside, getting lean and hardened like a winter tree.
The sons of the Watchers rest here.
The Grass of King Zachariel
The king told those who engraved the letters and the symbols onto the hard woods {nl}to abstain from sin, but they lost their memories as the king ordered. {nl}I did it because I was afraid that the demons and the people with malicious intent may steal my artifacts. {nl}However, I don't want to repeat that for my people.
(The book has rotted so much that nothing inside can be read.)
The minister said, {nl}'We already heard the words of His Majesty. {nl}We don't know exactly why, but the reason the Royal Mausoleum was built was not to show off, {nl}but to prepare for the forecast that may bring chaos to the kingdom and change the future of the humans. {nl}If we don't do this important task, who will?'
Warning Sign for Unauthorized Entrants
To protect the sacred secret of King Zachariel, no one may enter this facility.
Anyone entering here unauthorized will be punished for their sin.
Eviction Order
This facility will soon be shut down. {nl}I ask all construction workers and related people of the Royal Mausoleum to move out.
Baron Soldier Chagos' Diary
The magician, who appeared from somewhere, told the ignorant baron that the object is located here.
The way to eternal youth. {nl}I can't find the way there: the place where only death awaits.
Crumbling Document
The Demon Lord Helgasercle, divided the spirit of the Demon Lord Hauberk. {nl}This was used to power the barrier that now surrounds the Mage Tower and then was scattered throughout the kingdom.
Many magicians came to break the barrier, but they could not succeed with just the foundations stones that were gathered at the tower.
To all adventurers of the kingdom, {nl}the Mage Tower offers gold to those who bring back the fragments of Hauberk's spirit.
Order to defeat the Demons
I hereby order in the name of Vakarine! {nl}After Medzio Diena, they can no longer be forgiven. {nl}They are trying to expand their power by penetrating into the crack that was created in the barrier.
All the Kupoles here shall defeat Demon Lords Blut, Nuaele, and Baltrus first. {nl}The enemy will panic without their commanders and will be easier to defeat.
Kupoles who can't attack should concentrate on blocking the crack. {nl}We can't allow more demons from going to the Demon Lords.
How should I live from now on? {nl}I should have moved to Klaipeda.
Since you've placed them into the inventory, you can read them anytime.
Mirtis' power was so overwhelming that Cunningham had to make an important decision.
I hear that more and more monsters are appearing in the Baron Arleruno's land. {nl}Please defeat those monsters before they take any innocent lives.
According to the information I've gathered from the wings of Baibora, the demons come out in groups from a place called Demon's Prison. {nl}Please help us with this to prevent a greater chaos from happening.
Help the druids that were dispatched to the farm of the Green Family. {nl}They're looking for people who can help with the mass purification.
Dina Bee Farm is in danger of monster attacks. {nl}They can't even work so they desperately need help.
It's better to use the cable car than to fight through the monsters.
Just don't believe everything he says. {nl}He was known for being quite the show-off back at home.
It would be nice if all these Revelators being here meant that the goddesses are back.
Strength is the most important stat for swordsmen. {nl}You could also train yourself to be agile and possess strong Stamina. {nl}You should take a moment to decide on what to prioritize from now on.
Strength is the most important stat for archers. {nl}But, of course you can't ignore agile movement. {nl}You should take a moment to decide on what to prioritize from now on.
Intelligence is the most important stat for clerics. {nl}But sometimes you may need more stronger Strength or Spirit. {nl}You should take a moment to decide what to prioritize from now on.
Helping reconstruct Fedimian may be more meaningful than pottery. {nl}But people need something to soothe their hearts.
If I had the journal, I could continue my adventure, but I wasn't chosen... {nl}But for you things might be different...
If you cleverly use the dry air that forms around areas of severe cold, you'd be able to freeze any object even in a desert. {nl}However, if you can't receive the blessing from the goddess, it won't be possible to make that kind of air.
I'll report the damages. {nl}Chasing a Sparnas, a gigantic bird-type creature, will be hard. Despite being large, they are rather agile. {nl}It usually goes after the supplies, but I can't imagine nor find out why. I'm guessing someone's playing a trick.
Grain pocket was discovered in the ashes of the supplies. {nl}They smell so bad and old they can't be used for food at all. {nl}Please check the supplies for anything missing.
Defeat all the monsters nearby. {nl}The vicious energy in the thorn forest is constantly creating new monsters. {nl}But you should first defeat most of them before you face Ironbaum. {nl}Even a small factor could ruin the big task. {nl}Also, you could try threatening the monsters so they can't do what they want to do.
(Everything is scribbled so poorly that they can't be distinguished from letters or drawings.)
The facility that belonged to the workers who worked on the Mausoleum of Zachariel suddenly shut down. {nl}It's not like they left because finishing it was hopeless, but they just vanished all at once. {nl}Maybe it is related to the irregularly big size of the tomb and its complicated composition {nl}even after considering the fact that it was the grave to commemorate the greatest king in history.
King Zachariel had made many arrangements for future generations. {nl}We and the Jonas family were one of them. {nl}But the meaning of the arrangements is only known by the goddess. {nl}At least we know that the will of the king that we are protecting and the secret of the tomb indicates one person.
Trees become bigger as years pass. {nl}There are only Woodmen here but when you think of the large trees or the trees that stand in the old capital city... {nl}You can't help but think of the existence of even larger trees. {nl}After the disaster occurred, many plants turned into monsters so we can't ever rule out that possibility.
(There are barely legible words written here.) {nl}Euros could not hold his breath any longer so he ended up inhaling the spores and died. {nl}Mushworts hunt people with the cruelest method I've ever seen. {nl}They walk around our gathering places and shake out mushrooms that release spores.
We never know when they'll release spores. If we don't stop them, the entire camp could be annihilated. {nl}I have no way to keep safe from the spores. I can't stop coughing...
The training officer completed the training at the camp in the Woods of the Linked Bridges, in accordance with the order to prepare for future disasters. {nl}I hereby grant this certificate. 
The Mausoleum of Zachariel has never allowed anyone entry. {nl}If the object was not for the world to know of, then we could've hidden it so that none could find it, but instead we just built a giant tomb to protect it.{nl}Is this the great king's conceit or does it hold a different meaning?
For the first step: recharge the magical essence I gave to you. Look for where magic is condensed at Pavydo Mixed Forest. {nl}You won't be able to use the magical essence right away, however, since it has also absorbed some malign energy. {nl}For that, you'll need to collect Operor saliva and purify it at the altar of purification at the Wasteland of Renistu.
Name: Hayraven{nl}Sex: Male{nl}Occupation: Merchant{nl}List of items: luxurious goods, weapons {nl}{nl}In accordance with kingdom laws, you may enter.
If you're seeing this you either didn't pay me in full or did something I told you not to do. {nl}I have cursed this letter. {nl}I've no idea what's gonna happen to you from now on, but know that my curse is absolute.
The one who fell while researching. {nl}Return to the goddess by becoming a part of the canyon. {nl}The saddened mind breaks the gold stones of the canyon and the poured alcohol soaks into the ground on behalf of the tears.
Eventually, Ruklys had failed. {nl}He was destroyed and broken by those who were jealous of him. {nl}He left the goddess in my hands. {nl}
Every object possess the inner strength of its possessor. {nl}And to add to the magical interpretations on that, they could also transform the shapes of their possessors. {nl}Objects belonging to demons could do it with relative ease. (The same applies to the sacred areas, but don't even dare doing that in those places.)
But that's still just a theory despite the efforts of many frontiers. {nl}The possessor's inner strength and interpretations can never be fully understood if it were not for the possessor himself. {nl}That's why we hope for the blessing from the goddess or the wisdom from the possessor for the knowledge we lack.
I shall name you Revelator, my representative sent out to seek help from others. {nl}We can't be deceived any more. {nl}We have to protest against the violence behind the mask that claims to protect us.
We believe your help is the main factor to our success so that our efforts will not have been in vain.
We've finally arrived in front of the Zachariel's Royal Mausoleum. {nl}He was the first king of this kingdom and used an enormous number of people to build it. {nl}I believe only this place can answer the question I've had in my mind for a long time.
What was he trying to protect with this gigantic Royal Mausoleum? {nl}The answer must be inside, but the bleak atmosphere the interior exudes makes me hesitate to enter.
There's something inside the dark tomb.{nl}As I advanced inside, the large stone statues all turned to look down at me and then chased me out. {nl}I guess the great king in the past is still the great king in the present. {nl}I better investigate from the pillar outside of the Royal Mausoleum.
With the help from a young, kind historian, I was able to find a big clue. {nl}Yes. The best place to hide a tree is in a forest. {nl}Ruko Plateau and King's Plateau... I'm so close I can almost touch it. {nl}I'm confident the goddess sent him to me. May the blessing of the goddess always be with us!
Some pillars unlock the tomb{nl}and some altars lock it.{nl}The magical energy that surrounds{nl}the tomb moves by a key.{nl}But none among us can be that key. {nl}We were not Chosen.
The curse disturbs the rules of the universe that are being controlled by the goddess through human greed. {nl}These rules in the human world get influenced by the personalities of each person, their abilities and their potential power. {nl}The cases when these abilities get released depend on the conditions above.
According to the old writing left on the Great Cathedral, that is using a small part of the goddess' abilities secretly. {nl}Some people say that after seducing the weak minds of people, the demons used them for the source of the curse. {nl}May the goddess bless you!
There are two ways to release the curse: {nl}Remove the curse using a greater power or eliminate its caster. {nl}
Removing the curse using a greater power: {nl}This way depends on whether the power that overwhelms the curse comes from good or evil and from darkness or light.{nl}{nl}The most important factor for eliminating the caster: {nl}Even after eliminating the caster, the curse may not be removed due to other factors.{nl}{nl}I have no doubt that the power of the goddess is stronger.
There are mainly two ways to spread the curse. {nl}First, using equipment and uttering simple words. It sounds easy but it is, in fact, the hardest way. {nl}Therefore, from the example of the Pilgrim's Way, we mainly use the cursed ones as the mediums to spread the curse.
When a caster makes a curse, the caster has a tremendous influence on the mind of the victim. Their ego usually can't endure the feeling of guilt this causes. {nl}It seems the magic that was used on the cursed city of Ruklys is of a higher level than the one used on Naktis. We need to look into it more.

I cannot guarantee the safety of other Holy Relics or the keys so you best hurry.
I'm just listening! I'm not going to do what you say! {nl}I don't think wheat will grow here no matter what kind of magic you use. {nl}I need to look for my son's body, so you better keep it short!
The picture of the essence is drawn on the old surface.
The Eternal Adventure
Well, you're a new face. Did Julian send you?
Yeah. There's something weird about Goddess Laima. {nl}No one seems to know when she disappeared. {nl}To be honest nobody seems to really know whether or not she actually is a goddess.
She has never appeared before. {nl}Although I've read somewhere that she does appear every now and then...
Even though it would be bad for my business, {nl}I wish I could just live peacefully rather than live in fear of monsters coming at any moment.
Welcome! {nl}While I can do basic repairs, I don't have the materials to create anything. {nl}Take a look at what I have.
When all is said and done, I don't lie about my prices. {nl}Everything I sell is priced honestly and accordingly.
Fire is a grace sent to us by Goddess Gabija. {nl} You won't become a great Pyromancer if you don't acknowledge that.
The goddesses may be all gone but my powers are still doing fine. {nl} I'm sure it's proof that Goddess Gabija is at least safe somewhere.
Killing enemies one by one from a distance is the beauty of the bow and arrow. {nl}It doesn't matter how many shots you have to take, the shots that actually hit {nl}are the ones that count.
Monk Lotze
I'll do whatever it takes to take back the monastery from the monsters.
I dislike those Hunters. {nl}Outsiders must not interfere with the affairs of the monastery.
Monk Zidas
It would do us good if everyone stopped being so stubborn. {nl}I am sure the Hunters will be a great help in retaking the monastery...
I don't like how everyone is insisting their opinions to be right. {nl}It would be great if we helped each other.
Monk Ortega
I don't like those Hunters. {nl}Especially the one called Natasha. I don't know why she is bothering Potos...
I'll make my preparations to retake the monastery from here. {nl}I could ask for the Hunters to lend me their power but... they're so cold-hearted.
According to the priests, Laima is the goddess of fate and foresight. {nl}If Laima really exists, wouldn't she know the world would turn out like this?
It's been a year since the civil war broke out. Prices in town have risen dramatically. {nl}Commander Ruklys has sent for aid, to restore the town's dwindling supplies.
It's been a while since we've had any good news. {nl}There's talk about King Kadumel going after the commander.
The guard posts have been reinforced in response to the king's forces movements in the country.
It's been confirmed that the king commands a large army. {nl}But if General Hayatin can muster enough volunteer soldiers,{nl}the incompetent king will likely surrender or retreat.
The city is running out of food and supplies. {nl}There are only mice in the food storage and the city... {nl}{nl}(The rest is illegible.)
Rumor has it that Ruklys has heard about the citizens' harsh conditions {nl}and is negotiating with Kadumel for their amnesty. {nl}{nl}If the commander wants, we could just stand still...
Premier Eminent is in talks with Commander Ruklys. {nl}We may have to move to the Fortress of the Land and let the Royal Army claim the city.
It's good news for our the civilians at least. {nl}Despite the town being conceded, the Fortress of the Land will not be taken as easily.
King Kadumel is keen on persecuting the townspeople and burning the Fortress of the Land.{nl}The premier is pushing Commander Ruklys to negotiate terms, {nl}ensuring that the civilians are safe from enemy forces.
Despite the Royal Army occupying the town, there has yet to be any threatening movement. {nl}What's going to happen to us...
As promised, I will cast magic on you that will protect you from the Petrifying Frost. {nl}But if you leave this region, this magic won't be as effective so be careful.
There has been no progress since Ruklys' group retreated to the Fortress of the Land. {nl}The priests under Maven's direction are reluctant to fight, {nl}and the king is hiring mages by paying them a hefty sum.
But we expect little to no progress at all even after their participation.
How could this happen?! {nl}Lydia Schaffen is aiding Kadumel's forces!
Lydia Schaffen, a person I've only heard of in rumors, came to the city with her followers. {nl}The officers and soldiers expect she'll change the tide of the battle. {nl}His Majesty ordered us to support her to the best of our ability.
Commander Ruklys has fallen in battle, and the Fortress of the Land has been taken. {nl}Some people say he was killed by Lydia Schaffen's arrow,{nl}while others say by the royal magicians' magic. {nl}{nl}It is indeed sad news.
Propaganda of the Kingdom
Surrender by throwing away your weapons.{nl}It is indeed your fault that you've created the Fortress of the Land to stand against the kingdom, {nl}but the merciful King Kadumel will spare you.
Only Premier Eminent, the chancellor of the great kingdom will forgive your treason. {nl}Surrender. You've been misled by the criminal, Ruklys.
Long live the great Royal Army! {nl}Long live the great Premier Eminent!
Even Lydia Schaffen, a friend of Ruklys, sided with the Royal Army. {nl}No one will stand on your side. {nl}With your hands, collapse the Fortress of the Land, the proof of your treason, {nl}and wave the white flag. {nl}{nl}The faithful Premier Eminent shall forgive all.
Are you going to die with Ruklys who misled you with his malicious tricks,{nl}to create the Fortress of the Land to stand against the kingdom? {nl}{nl}Or live a new life by serving the king until the end by following the way of Premier Eminent,{nl}who protected the kingdom from the rebellion?
Records of the Rebel Army
As I was retreating from the Royal Army, I encountered many demons. {nl}It doesn't make sense. Where did they come from?
There's no hope at all. Ah... my lovely Ridell. {nl}The kingdom soldiers did not keep their word. We're all going to die.
Those soldiers of the Royal Army! Especially Premier Eminent! {nl}They're no different from demons. Even the goddesses would not forgive them.
I don't want to die. {nl}We were just following the goddesses' words. {nl}Everyone is killing each other in the names of the goddesses. {nl}Who has deceived us? {nl}
Royal Army Recruit Propaganda
The Royal Army needs competent people like you! {nl}Loyalty to the kingdom! To victory and a brighter future!
Pledge loyalty to the Royal Army and become a new and better person. {nl}The goddesses protect our armies.
Life and death... which one would you choose? {nl}The only way to survive is to swear loyalty to the kingdom!
Don't forget that the Royal Army has won 600 years ago. {nl}Join us. You sins can be forgiven.
Please move with us if possible. {nl}There's been a number of monster sightings near here.
The supplies should be here soon... {nl}Are they going to be late again?
You will need various tools when traveling. {nl}It's better to buy them in advance.
Goddess Laima... Actually, I don't know her that well. No one does, except for her priests. {nl}I heard she's the goddess of fate and foresight, but she has not once appeared before us.
I just remembered something while I was talking to you. {nl}Maybe Goddess Laima knew everything about the disaster beforehand.
I pray to Goddess Gabija everyday. It keeps the house warm. {nl}As you may already know, Goddess Gabija controls fire and since I'm a housewife, {nl}I am close to fire as well.
If you cleverly use the dry air that forms around areas of severe cold, {nl}you'd be able to freeze any object even in a desert. {nl}{nl}However, if you can't receive the blessing from the goddess, {nl}it won't be possible to make that kind of air.
The Records of the Master Himself
I've studied magic for a long time as a sorcerer. {nl}From the process, the advancement of sorcery can't be explained without relating with demons, {nl}and since they've fought against the goddesses, {nl}the field has been widened to the study of the goddesses as well.
While I was doing that, I learned of the field of accumulation. {nl}It's an empty field. The theory of the beginning and the end is a fantastic library,{nl}at the boundary of transcendency, all for one purpose.
Records about Disciple Laius
My other disciple, Laius, is clever and a fast learner but has an insatiable greed for knowledge. {nl}I am worried that he may fail the task. {nl}A scholar should always try to learn, but obsessing about it will make one walk the wrong path.
Despite that, Laius is a disciple I acknowledge. {nl}His passion towards me and knowledge is just being expressed in a wrong way.
I hope Laius realizes this himself. {nl}Since he is my disciple, I believe he can do it.
Records about Disciple Hones
Among my disciples, two of them followed me until my later years and,{nl}will be my successors after my death.
Hones, who is one of them, is lacking in scholarly intelligence. {nl}However, I am sure his faithfulness and efforts will help him follow my teachings.
Records of the Hidden Object
...I don't know whether I should thank the goddesses for this discovery or not. My greed for knowledge can ruin the world.
I can't sleep well for fear of my research results being spread by demon investigation. {nl}That's why I wish to pass the rest of the research to the one I can trust.
The Inheritance of the Master
As the priests and theologians know, Goddess Vaivora is in charge of the library,{nl}where all records of the world are stored. I was able to check several records in that {nl}fantastic library after the research and long studying I can't tell anyone about at the moment. {nl}
From the many records of the goddess, I was only able to see a few. {nl}Nevertheless, the fact that I checked the existence of the records with the important facts {nl}was astonishing. {nl}
The record which I can use to find the whereabouts of all the goddesses... {nl}If one had such secret information, it would be possible to predict the goddesses' {nl}future locations by analyzing what they did in the past. {nl}Because of that, their future plans may be disturbed or put at risk. {nl}
This is more dangerous because, if the demons find out the truth, {nl}their desire for the library will grow and, if they do acquire that knowledge, {nl}the world will be swallowed by evil. That's why - {nl}
(The rest is blurred and unreadable.)
Disciple Hones' Memo
If you want to find the master's research, you have to find three spatial magic stones {nl}and activate the fusion device.
The Spatial Magic Gem of Contract is at the reception room. {nl}The monsters probably have the fragments. {nl}Collect all the fragments of the magical stones and go to the{nl}preserved magic circle in the Grave of the Saints to restore them.
The Spatial Magic Gem of Offer is with the Templeshooter. {nl}The Wisdom Guiding Stone will help you find the hidden Templeshooter.
The Spatial Magic Gem of Promise can be found in Siaura Mine. {nl}Use the Soul Crystal on the monsters first to collect their Condensed Spite. {nl}With that, destroy the stones in Siaura Mine. {nl}Black Chasers will pursue from behind, avoid them and go to the end of the mine{nl}to find the magic gem.
When you find all three spatial magic gems, go to the fusion device again,{nl}and place the magic gems there. {nl}The path to the master's research will then open at the Laudi Tower.
Spirit
Please... save us from this horrible contract... {nl}Remove us from this... Contract of Enunciation...
The Contract of Enunciation... {nl} we'll vanish if we speak... I have no regrets...
Eternal imprisonment... from the restraints of the contract... {nl}Break... the Pot of Silence...
The Pot of Silence is at Memum Corridor... {nl}I'm so... exhausted...
Where to start...
I was a disciple of Agailla Flurry when I was alive. {nl}I didn't have any magical abilities so I couldn't use magic.
That's why I survived Helgasercle's wrath. {nl}She must've thought she didn't have to kill me since I wasn't able to use magic.
I am confident I am better when it comes to theories than other disciples... {nl}That's why I studied magic. And in my studies, I learned of the magic stone of interaction.
I came here when Helgasercle attacked the Mage Tower. {nl}I thought that if I could use the magic stone of interaction, I'd be able to use magic.
But, Archon drove me away from the Mage Tower. {nl}Due to this disturbance, the magic stone activated defensive magic, linking my,{nl}and Archon's spirit to each other.
As a result, Archon was sealed and my body disappeared without a trace. {nl}We became shackled to each other.
I've been tied here for hundreds of years... {nl}Since I can't do anything with my astral body.
The bigger problem is that Archon was released as well. {nl}I lost the body, but Archon, who is a demon, is still alive.
Memorial Stone
By avoiding the eyes of Helgasercle, I was able to come here to continue my research. {nl}I needed to find a way. A way to reduce the power of demons and increase that magical power.
By my name, Valius, the one who walks the way of Linker, {nl}I swear that I will not surrender to the demons.
I've made many magical tools, but I wasn't able to repel the attacks of the demons. {nl}Without checking out the result, I close my eyes.
Records of Investigation
The basics of Linker magic are to find the common factors in each others' spirits. {nl}So it is impossible if the acceptor does not possess any magical abilities or bases. {nl}
I've completed the first stage magic stone. {nl}It still does not satisfy the previous objective of delivering the perfect magic,{nl}and magical power somewhat.{nl}But now, at last it is possible to accept Linker Magic even without magical ability.{nl}
Proposal
If a magician finds a way to share all his abilities and knowledge with another, {nl}then even those without magical abilities can become a strong magician,{nl}within a short period of time.
This way, you'd be able to hide from the eyes of Helgasercle,{nl}who is extremely afraid of the disciple of Agailla Flurry appearing.
However, I'm not sure if this is at all possible or whether or not it will have any side effects.
Design Proposal
The magic stone of the interaction can be made to work on the behalf of a Linker. {nl}However, maintaining the stone of interaction requires a considerable amount of magical power.
Hence, we decided to maintain the magic stone of the interaction {nl}with 12 regenerating magical power stones. {nl}If no problems arise, we will be able to maintain it, but if the magical power supply is cut, {nl}it won't last long.
Adrijus' Notice Board
I am looking for a stone rubbing of the tablet at the central sanctum. {nl}If you find any tablets with writings engraved, make a rubbing off of it. {nl}- Adrijus
Stained Tablet
It seems that someone has already made a rubbing since there is a vague trace of ink. {nl}Shall I read it?
King Kadumel finally dies.
Instead of the Mage Tower, the Tower of Fire would be a more fitting name for Flurry's tower.
This is a very secluded area so monsters usually prey around here. {nl}Be careful around here.
Research Records of Demetrius
In ancient times, humans lived with the goddesses. {nl}When I first heard of this piece of folklore, {nl}I thought it was made up out of respect for the goddesses. {nl}{nl}I started to investigate what historic background caused such reverence, {nl}as well as why this myth was created.
I increased the extent of my research. {nl}I traveled to many regions of the kingdom and collected similar cases. {nl}And I started to believe that this story was part of a bigger truth rather {nl}than just a small truth covered in fabrication.
The facts that we've discovered so far are thus: {nl}{nl}In the beginning, or a period not that far from the beginning, {nl}all humans used to live with the goddesses underground. {nl}I suppose the goddesses used to be more directly involved with humans. {nl}I have no idea why but soon, the humans left that place and scattered across the land.
This movement was made very naturally. {nl}If that hadn't been the case, then there must have been conflicts, {nl}and more fables would have been created as a result.
I believe the goddesses erased all memory and records of that time completely. {nl}However, we can't deny the possibility that another reason may exist {nl}due to the fact that this legend still remains despite the authority of the great goddesses.
And this is a very cautious prediction, but the creatures that we call demons{nl}may exist underground. {nl}{nl}Though that theory is hard to accept when we think about all the facts {nl}that are recorded in history and the present.
I can smell many Avietes. I heard they're effective... Could you share them with us?
Thank you. I will give you as many as you need. {nl}You will be successful.
I wanted to eat it...
You're not collecting Avietes?
I'll give them to you. {nl}You will be successful.
Our hope will definitely come true.
I trust Horaceus.
I'll cheer up and smile until the day comes.
I guess I'll take this tombstone rubbing to the person who wants it.
Since I've already made the rubbing, I'll give it to the person who wants it.
Copy of Prediction
Death begets death.
I am busy right now. We better do it later.
Ah, you're the one Adrijus sent. {nl}I've obtained the diluting solution he ordered. {nl}Be careful not to break the glass.
One glass of diluting solution will be enough.
Epitaph of Juan
I lie here without yet creating thirteen thousand pieces of armor. {nl}I hope to finish them alongside the goddesses.
I can hear a whisper in my head.
Please install the device I gave you in the 2nd district of Crystal Mine.
The location is Sidabro Rest Place in Vejo Ravine. {nl}I hope he's still alive.
Klaipeda Market
Give me the effigy. I shall calm the spirits.
The monsters will feel threatened by the energies that spurt out from the crystals {nl}containing my authority and begin their attack.
Please protect the crystals so that they may produce my authority, {nl}and spread it to Sirdgela Forest.
You prepared this, brother? You're truly a great man.
I can sense the wrath of the spirits.
Incense Burner
The scent of the incense is spreading from the Incense Burner.
I can feel the spirits wailing.
I can feel the pain of the spirits.
I can feel the regrets of the spirits.
The seal is not yet ready? {nl}It pains me so that you are the only one I can trust.
Can you lay the villagers' spirits to rest in peace?
The Basics of Ignition
Ignition differs by elements, but with the blessing from the goddess, there may be cases where we can ignore that. {nl}To do so, we should try hard to achieve the scholarly knowledge and the faithfulness to the goddesses.
1. Dried environment{nl}2. Something that can be ridden on. {nl}3. Enough mana. {nl}4. The blessing of the goddesses.
Flurry... turned into a handful of ashes by illuminating a great light. {nl}Did that demon do something? {nl}I had no idea, being a mere probationary wizard.

I've received your letter. {nl}Now is the chance the goddesses gave to you since Legwyn is dead. {nl}It's great to hear that the lads of the Legwyn family trust you.
I've changed the name on this certificate for you so return the rest of documents to me. {nl}I guarantee either his assets or his land document. {nl}Please pay me the deposit as you did last time.
Anyone under the Legwyn name can't be left alive. Even their servants. {nl}Please, get rid of Legwyn's daughter. She is the Squire Master.

It seems that you don't have a problem moving your body. {nl}You almost got into deep trouble.
Ah, I am Mintz. I lead the Hunters. {nl}If it's fine with you, I want to have a talk at my camp at Dumvala Crossroads.
For now, there is no way to help the patient.
Have you tried giving the antidote?
Please go to Viltis Forest after persuading the senior monk.
Thanks! {nl}I ran away without noticing my bag was ripped by the thorns.
We ran away from Laukyme Swamp. {nl}When you find the pages of the documents from Ershike Path to Dumvala Crossroads, {nl}please bring them to me.
No. That cannot be done. {nl}I don't have anything more to say about the expulsion, {nl}until I retake the monastery and save the abbot.
What? You're going with the Hunters? {nl}Well... I don't approve, but I guess I can't do anything about it.{nl}Since Marko told you that he'd go with them... Okay.
Are you going to retake the monastery with the Hunters?{nl}That's good news, but I guess that means Marko changed his mind, huh?
I'm worried about the abbot of the monastery who should be at the prayer room. {nl}I don't know if the Hunters can be trusted...
I don't know if it's going to be okay. {nl}It feels like the outsiders are swinging us around... {nl}I know Marko is clever, so we should trust him.
At any rate, we will trust Marko's orders. {nl}It's good that we've got reliable reinforcements now.
Also, it's important to retake the monastery as soon as possible. {nl}The safety of the monastery's is critical.
Unknown traveler. Falls down under the nameless poison.{nl}Now, stop this journey and rest in peace in the arms of the goddesses.

Thank you. {nl}If their number could be reduced by even a bit, I'd feel more relaxed.
Thanks. {nl}If you see any bubble that spurts out air, it means that there are spiny water chestnuts. {nl}Please bring me the roots of those.
Really? {nl}If you can help me, I'll do anything I can.
We've retaken the hall. {nl}Let's keep moving forward!
Quickly, let's save the abbot!
Finally, the time to retake the monastery has come.
I shall go with the Revelator. {nl}Let's do this as best as we can.
Let's run fast from the next corridor. {nl}I know you're exhausted, but hang on! We're almost there.
I'll block the monsters that are rushing in here. {nl}You and Goss move up first.
Thanks. {nl}I saw the Moheim brothers enter the monastery a while ago. {nl}Looking after the important objects is also their responsibility, so you better ask them.
I'm sorry I bothered you. {nl}The boxes are lined up inside the reception room.
So you've come. {nl}Please give me the Crystal Ball.
Darn! Until the bitter end... {nl}You two! Follow that guy! {nl}The rest of you, help me!
Concerned Hunter
Hey...! Get a hold of yourself!
Thank you. I have far too many things to do... {nl}I have to sort out the green cover pages, but I can't find any. {nl}Please look for them around the furniture inside the monastery.
For what reason did you visit this cursed city? {nl}Go back if you have none.
So, you are the famous Revelator. {nl}I have definitely heard about you before.
I shall temporarily permit your entrance. {nl}The Knights of Kaliss are looking for competent people like you.
However, all the authority here belongs to our Royal Army.{nl}Please behave well.
Saltistter? What are you talking about? {nl}Such nonsense you speak...

I am sorry, but I can't come forward myself. {nl}It's just... if I use magic, the demons will sense it.
I will correct the disrupted magic of this tower.{nl} I will have to use magic at first so monsters will rush in. Please protect me.
I hope Goddess Gabija is safe... Let's hurry.
I don't have a good feeling about it. That vibration...{nl}Let's move quickly for now.
We can help Goddess Gabija if we have the Jewel of Prominence.
The goddess has reached her limit.{nl}We should give her the Jewel of Prominence as quickly as possible.
That vibration... It's serious.
Let's quickly go to Magic Control Room.{nl}I will be able to control the magic of the tower.
It's fortunate that the Magic Control Room is near.{nl}Let's go quickly.

Story of Fire
I saw a bizarre sight at the goddess' whereabouts at the top of the tower. The bird beside Gabija, by her grace, lit up and engulfed itself in flames.{nl}
The serenely burning fire. The wings consumed by flames. Nothing else in this world has left me more in awe than that sight.{nl}
Hmm... Have the party members fully gathered yet?
Welcome to the Mercenary Post. {nl}Unfortunately... I don't have any appropriate requests for you yet.{nl}
I will give you an appropriate quest when you return with reliable comrades.{nl}If there are such requests.{nl}
There is a good request that just came in.{nl}Would you like to take it?
Anyway, that is very strange.{nl}If it was Goddess Laima's will, not just anyone could undo her seal.
Whether this revelation will become a new beacon of hope or a start of a new disaster, {nl}is indeed difficult to judge... We are thinking of continuing our investigation.
)}My son volunteered to join the army.{nl}So I have been offering my prayers to the great Goddess Ausrine.{nl}
)}Monsters have been multiplying to the point where people cannot safely live in the forest anymore.{nl}At least Klaipeda is still safe.{nl}
Maybe Goddess Ausrine gave us her protection.{nl}Isn't she the goddess who leads all other goddesses?
)}I am glad my son dreams of becoming a soldier...{nl}But the monsters keep increasing in number, and I'm worried he will be injured.
(You told him about the revelation that you found at the Crystal Mine.)
Morning dawns after night, does it not? Goddess Ausrine is the one who brings us morning. {nl}Not only that, when we die, we go to her as well.
Eternal life...{nl}Through Goddess Ausrine's power, my life extends for every Owl Statue I sculpt.{nl}If this old body of mine can give her strength and help the world then I am determined to carry on forever. 
Are you interested in everlasting life?{nl}Since necromancers deal with the dead, they can sense life forces, and, depending on their ability, manipulate it. {nl}If you are as good as I am, absorbing that life force to extend your own is possible.
Are you curious as to how I obtained eternal life?{nl}If stilled time is eternal, then you can consider it life everlasting.{nl}By stopping time I maintain a body that is neither aging nor dying.{nl}Whether or not quiescence can be described as eternal, I do not have an answer.
Unless during a specific window of time, {nl}recklessly touching the terminal would only bring trouble. {nl}It could release the curse.
If all that is small is gathered, they shall one day add up to a larger force.
It is said the statue of Goddess Ausrine at Klaipeda's central plaza,{nl}is related with the story of Modestas, the Gambler.
Back when the Goddess Statue was just finished, no one knew who the statue represented. {nl}Only the Dievdirbys who carved the statue and Modestas knew.
Many tried to reveal the identity of the Statue by challenging Modestas to bets, but he passed away before losing even once.
I thank you again in the name of all fate. {nl}From here on, I will follow the stars to find Goddess Ausrine.{nl}

Aiste asked the elderly beggar, {nl}'Did you by any chance pick up the silver coins I dropped? Would you return them to me? I worked very hard everyday for those coins and really need them.'{nl}{nl}
The beggar was taken aback. Aiste was asking for the impossible. After all, finding dropped coins in Fedimian was unthinkable. {nl}The old beggar was about to explain this to Aiste but instead remarked, {nl}'I've also lost coins in this area. It would be nice if you looked for mine as you searched for yours.'{nl}{nl}
'Why don't you go to where you work and explain what happened to them? Make sure you look lost.' The beggar then hesitantly added, {nl}'In the meantime, I'll be looking for your silver coins here.'{nl}{nl}
And so he said, {nl}'Just as you've been able to pick up all my fruit, you should be able to find your lost money at Fedimian, so do not tell me to give you a second pay.' {nl}The orchard owner's cold words brought tears to the girl's eyes. {nl}The sight broke his heart, but even so, he did not want to give her any more money. {nl}{nl}
He was soon overtaken by guilt and said, {nl}'If you really need that money, you should go to the silversmith's.'{nl}{nl}
The silversmith, after hearing Aiste's story, stated, {nl}'Even for children it is foolish to be so careless. How could you not know that all money that falls on Fedimian soil disappears, never to be found again?'{nl}{nl}
Aiste was surprised by what the silversmith said and grew sad. {nl}After a while she asked, {nl}'Then why is it that such a cruel thing happens?'{nl}{nl}
Even the silversmith did not know the true answer, so he improvised, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna must be taking them.'{nl}{nl}
Hearing those words, Aiste replied, {nl}'Then I will just have to go ask the goddess.' {nl}The silversmith was astounded and replied, {nl}'While you're at it, why don't you ask the goddess to return my silverware?'{nl}{nl}
An exhausted Aiste soon arrived at the Statue of Goddess Zemyna. {nl}She prostrated herself before it and prayed to the Goddess Statue represented, her head completely down. {nl}'Oh, goddess. Please return my lost silver coins.' {nl}Soon, while offering her prayers, Aiste could no longer hold in her sadness and she finally wept.{nl}{nl}
How long did she pray crying? {nl}Suddenly, Aiste heard a voice addressed to her. {nl}'My child, have come to take back what you have lost?'{nl}{nl}
The goddess' voice was heard again. {nl}'Aiste, what your asking from me is not in a method I approve of. Where I reign there is no harvest nor fruits to those who do not work.'{nl}{nl}
'But I worked very hard today!'{nl}{nl}
'I know. So instead, I will give you and the others a chance. Look under your feet.'{nl}{nl}
After a number of steps, Aiste thought about the silversmith, {nl}and, again, went to his house and knocked on his door. {nl}As if the silversmith was waiting for her return, he opened the door immediately and said. {nl}'I'm sorry. I regret sending you away like that. I'll give you some silver. {nl}This time, be careful not to drop any and get home safely.'{nl}{nl}
As the silversmith held out his silver coins, Aiste shook her head and said,{nl}'No thank you, the goddess returned all my coins. On top of that she gave me even more. {nl}I remembered you saying you had also lost silver, so I came to give you my extra coins. You don't need to give me yours.'{nl}{nl}
At first, the silversmith was skeptical about the coins being returned, {nl}so he was surprised when Aiste showed him genuine coins. After thinking for a while, the silversmith said, {nl}'Then how about this. You give me what you want while you accept what I was about to give you. {nl}Isn't that fair? On top of that I'll give you a pouch to carry your extra silver.'{nl}{nl}
After leaving the silversmith's house, {nl}Aiste suddenly remembered that the old beggar must still be looking for her lost coins and worried about him. {nl}On her way to the beggar, she met the orchard owner again. {nl}Upon seeing Aiste, the orchard owner was overjoyed. {nl}'I was looking for you. I'm sorry for sending you off earlier. As an apology, I'll give you your salary again. {nl}Please be careful not to lose it this time.'{nl}{nl}
The orchard owner took out a large amount of coins, more than what Aiste's salary was, and handed it to her. {nl}However, Aiste shook her head and said, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna already returned my money to me. The silversmith also helped me, so now I actually have too much. {nl}Here, take a look.'{nl}{nl}
Disregarding the amount Aiste had shown him, the orchard owner said, {nl}'Well, even so, I would be ashamed for not giving you my due, so please just take it.' {nl}After saying this, the orchard owner stuffed his coins into Aiste's bag and left. {nl}By the time Aiste could muster up the energy to call the orchard owner, he was too far away.{nl}{nl}
She hesitated for a moment but then set her mind on the beggar. {nl}After a bit of walking, Aiste arrived at where they met. The old beggar spotted her first and hurried over to her. {nl}He showed her the silver coins he was clenching onto and said, 'Look! I found your lost silver.' {nl}Aiste received the beggar's silver and then showed the beggar her bag and said, {nl}'Look, I found your silver coins too.'{nl}{nl}
After that, Aiste also held out her bag and said, {nl}'This is a gift as thanks for looking for my silver. I was given this through Goddess Zemyna's grace.' {nl}Aiste then left before the Old Beggar could figure out how to reply.{nl}{nl}
Over the jingling sound of gold, the old woman muttered. {nl}'If these two pieces of gold could ever marry, the baby gold would make me rich... but there's no life in these things...' {nl}Modestas heard those words, and decided to comment. {nl}'That gold won't make you rich by itself, so just put it into something worthwhile. {nl}Do you really think muttering at baby gold will do something?'{nl}
The old woman spoke plainly, 'Why not? If this way bears fruit, it'll be safe and secure.' {nl}'That's ridiculous. You should do what I do and gamble.' {nl}The woman was incensed.{nl}
'So, you think your betting ways are better?' {nl}'Why wouldn't I? There are moments where I could win or lose, but your way won't make any gold at all.' {nl}With Modestas' words, the old woman paused in thought. Finally, she said, {nl}'Then let's have a bet.'{nl}
The disturbing aura around her grew as soon as the offer reached Modestas' ears. He couldn't outright refuse. {nl}'What kind of bet?' {nl}'We'll see whether your way or my way will make us richer.' {nl}'And if I lose?'{nl}
'Don't worry about that. You will win, and you will lose - That won't change. The rules are fixed.' {nl}'What do you mean by that?' {nl}'By taking my offer, you will fail once, and you will win once. No matter what happens.' {nl}'Well, yeah. Winning and losing is how gambling works.'{nl}
'No. No matter how unlucky it may seem, you will win your first gamble. {nl}And then, no matter how favorable life may seem, you will fail the next.'{nl}
Modestas was still confused by these strange words. {nl}'So, you're saying I'll win on every odd bet, and lose on every even one?' {nl}'Yes. It will be so. You will win coin, and then you won't. Is that not fair? {nl}One coin will be enough to succeed, no matter how many bets you make. That is my offer.' {nl}'You think I'll switch between winning and losing, huh?{nl}
With her hand to her chin, the old woman gave a puzzling response. {nl}'Three times each, should be enough. Return to me after you make six gambles. {nl}Naturally, if you don't have more coin after your sixth bet, I will win.'{nl}
Modestas seemed to tremble. 'How much should I earn, then?' {nl}'You start with one gold piece,' she replied, 'and when you return, show me all your gold pieces but that one. {nl}If you stretch that single piece to anything more, then you win. As for the time... you have one week.' {nl}'So, what do you get when I lose?' Modestas reminded her.{nl}
'Well...' the old woman lingered, 'If you win, everyone will know about my gold - {nl}and you'll have the power of winning and losing. On the other hand...' {nl}''On the other hand...'?' Modestas said, tensely.{nl}
'When I win, then after this, the friends you know will disappear every time you lose a bet.' {nl}Modestas was unnerved by the conditions set. He did not immediately object, but thought of the victory, {nl}and soon accepted. Modestas was, most of all, the kind of person who never backed down.{nl}
Are you not busy? You seemed in a hurry on your horse before you passed by for a talk. You should stop worrying about me and go.' {nl} Sigfried, hearing Modestas' words, replied, {nl} 'I was busy, but I still have time to walk with you for another 10 minutes or so. This horse might not seem like much, but when it comes down to it he can go pretty fast.' {nl}
Seeing Sigfried not budge, Modestas tried again to persuade him, {nl} 'Wouldn't it be better to be early as opposed to be on time?' {nl} {nl} Hearing this, Sigfried became adamant, {nl} 'Do you not believe what I just said or are you willfully ignoring it all?' {nl} A disconcerted Modestas said, {nl} 'No, I didn't mean it like that......' {nl}
However, before Modestas could say any more, Sigfried said, 'If you don't believe me, why don't we have a bet?' {nl} {nl} Naturally, the words, 'Sure. What do you want to wager?' rose up in Modestas' throat.
Considering Modestas' habit, to simply not immediately accept a gamble took superhuman willpower from him. {nl} 'What...  what kind of bet?' {nl} 'We were going to bet on whether my horse is fast or not.' {nl} Modestas desperately fought his inner gambler.
As soon as the bet started, Sigfried tried every method possible to command his horse to move. Despite his efforts it didn't move a single hoof at all.{nl}At the end, Sigfried repeatedly cursed its strange behavior. Realizing he'd be late to his appointment without a horse, he threw the reins to Modestas and sprinted away.{nl}
As Sigfried disappeared, Modestas felt uncomfortable.
You, the young man with the horse, can you come over and help us for a bit?' {nl} Modestas had no idea what these soldiers needed help for, but since he could no longer ignore them, he decided to head over. {nl} Once Modestas arrived, one of the soldiers said, {nl} 'You came at just the right time. We would like you to referee a small gamble we're about to make here.' {nl}
What started as a small banter turned into a big argument, which finally grew to become a big money bet. The soldiers had already gathered their money and only had to decide the winner. Unfortunately, every goddess got equal votes and a winner couldn't be decided.{nl}
Thus, the soldiers decided to settle the bet by calling the first person who passed by, asking him who he thought the best goddess is, and deciding the winner from there. The soldiers agreed that the first passer-by would symbolize the will of whatever goddess he supported. {nl}
Since a big jackpot was on the line, the soldiers waited with bated breath for Modestas' answer. {nl}Knowing there was no right answer to the question, Modestas simply said aloud the name of his favorite goddess. {nl}
When he did, the soldiers reacted strangely. {nl} There was supposed to be an ecstatic winner and disappointed losers, but nobody seemed joyful nor disappointed. Instead, everyone had a bewildered look on their faces. {nl}
Modestas, perplexed by their reaction, asked for an explanation to which one of the soldiers answered, {nl}'We originally had votes for four goddesses but your choice isn't any of them, so now we have five goddesses.' {nl}Then the soldiers resumed their squabble about how to decide the winner. {nl}
The mood began to deteriorate so Modestas wanted to leave them. {nl}When he was about to take off, the soldiers blocked his path and accused him.{nl}'It's your fault the argument heated up even more. You're not thinking of just leaving are you?'{nl}Intimidated by the irritated soldiers, Modestas dared not to escape. {nl}
Knowing Modestas, he could not simply sit on the sidelines watching a big bet grow. Eventually, he became enticed to join.
Modestas, caught in the heat of the moment and ending up participating in the soldier's bet, finally remembered it was his turn to lose.{nl}But it was too late.{nl}
If you think about it, even if it was his turn to lose, all it took for him to lose was one more vote for any of the goddesses he didn't choose. With the odds of the next person walking by supporting his goddess being against him, the probability of winning was low anyway.{nl}
However, the victor was chosen unexpectedly. A commanding officer found the soldiers slacking, disciplined them and was about to lead them away. {nl}The soldiers, obeying the superior's command, were about to march off when they shrewdly asked him which goddess he favored. {nl}
Someone approached Modestas who had been lying down hurt and helped him get back on his feet. He turned out to be one of the people standing on the side, the wagon owner. {nl}The man who helped Modestas uttered with relief, {nl}'I am glad you're not too hurt. Your horse also didn't hurt himself tripping over that pit.'{nl}Modestas noticed a well-hidden pit where he pointed. {nl}The wagon owner continued.{nl}
'My horse became injured here and can no longer pull my wagon. It's just an empty wagon, but at any rate, it won't be going anywhere for a while. That's why I have a proposition. Won't you sell me your horse? I believe with a healthy horse pulling the wagon, even my injured horse can help pull it in some way.'{nl}
It was an unexpected suggestion, but Modestas had to ride the horse to quickly find and catch up to the soldiers. He immediately refused the offer.{nl}The wagon owner tried to explain there was no way his injured horse can pull the wagon alone but Modestas was not persuaded. After his repeated refusal, the wagon owner offered a new suggestion.{nl}'Then let's do this. What if you buy my wagon? I will sell it for cheap. Since my injured horse can't pull the wagon, it will be better off in your hands.'{nl}
Modestas, after saying he'll be back if he loses the bet, began to rein his horse when the old Alchemist let out an eerie cackle. This caught Modestas' attention, who turned around and looked at his person.{nl}
And right before his eyes, the lead nugget prize let out a sparkle and in a moment clearly became gold. {nl} The old Alchemist now snickered, 'Now you owe me one gold nugget, be sure to bring it.' {nl} Modestas protested, but as much as he looked, what the old Alchemist now held was clearly no longer lead. {nl}
This time, no matter what, I have to wage a bet against the world's richest, well maybe not the richest, but a wealthy man at the very least.'{nl}As soon as he uttered these words, his surroundings shook like an earthquake and a heavy, deep voice declared.{nl}'I am the richest in this region.'{nl}
Modestas scanned his surroundings but failed to find anyone. So he asked,{nl}'Who are you?'{nl}The heavy deep voice answered his question.{nl}'I am where you stand. In your tongue, I am called the mountain.'{nl}Modestas in disbelief, couldn't help but talk back.{nl}
You are... the mountain?'{nl}'That is correct. I am the mountain, and just as you are looking for, the richest around here.'{nl}'You are the mountain? Well, no, even if you are the mountain, how can you claim to be the richest?'{nl}'I own much land for my sierra stretches far. Further in me I contain large valuable lodes.'{nl}
Even if the mountain's veins contained nothing but rocks, he thought he could end up owning a large quarry to dig out valuable stones. Instead, the mountain had paid an inadequate reward.{nl}When Modestas pointed it out, the mountain disagreed.{nl}'All you own are two horses and a wagon.'
Surely one must wage things of equal value. This boulder is worth as much as you own.'{nl}With that said, the mountain returned to his former self, never to deal with Modestas nor anyone else ever again. {nl}Modestas, in his desperate situation, had wasted his crucial chance to just win one big boulder.{nl}Despite his bad luck, he consoled himself knowing at least he had horses and a wagon to transport the boulder.{nl}
In front of Modestas, who had been worrying, appeared a familiar figure. It was none other than the one who had started the bet, the suspicious old woman.{nl}The old woman asked Modestas.{nl}'How is it? Is it going well?'{nl}
Modestas confessed he was far from making profits, instead being in debt, and he had wasted all his chances to win and only had his last, losing bet remaining.{nl}After listening to his story the old woman flatly added, {nl}'Since you only have one bet left, go ahead and make your last losing bet. Then all that's left for you to do is pay up your end of the bargain for losing the bet against me.'{nl}Modestas was a man who loved to gamble but he was not the type to throw a tantrum nor was he a sore loser.
'Since you are unsure how to transport this boulder you suddenly won, how about this? Normally, I wouldn't change the initial conditions, but as an amusement I will give you a suggestion. Why don't you use your last bet to see whether or not I can lift this boulder up into your wagon? Even if you lose, at least you can have this heavy boulder loaded on your wagon.'{nl}
Modestas who had nothing to lose, nodded his head to accept her proposal. But before he could consent to the bet, the old woman continued. {nl}'But I can't just give you such a favorable idea for free. Therefore I will add one more condition.'{nl}
When Modestas asked about the condition, the old woman answered.{nl}'You are to take the boulder, which I will load onto the wagon, to Klaipeda. Then, turn it into an object of value which everyone will recognize and esteem. If you are successful then the punishment for losing the bet against me will become void. Your friends will not disappear. Since you already lost the bet against me, although this is difficult, I will still give you one more chance. How about it?'{nl}Like always Modestas had no choice.
When the boulder was set in its proper place with the help of the soldiers, the Alchemist who had left returned with another person. The Alchemist had brought with him a famous Dievdirbys sculptor.{nl}To the famous Dievdirbys, the Alchemist suggested, {nl}'Why don't you sculpt a statue of a goddess using this boulder, on this central site of Klaipeda? If this boulder is changed into a statue of a goddess, then nobody in Klaipeda will be able to deny its significance. I think that will fulfill your promise to the old woman.'{nl}
That the old woman appeared before him, that the many bets occurred, that the mountain erupted a stone for material was the divine providence of the goddesses, argued Modestas, persuading everyone. {nl}
Thus, the people decided to follow the words of Modestas, and Modestas relayed to the Dievdirbys the order to create the statue. {nl}
When the statue was finally finished, the citizens of Klaipeda gathered, curious to know the identity of the goddess who had been raised in the center of their beloved city.{nl}
The Dievdirbys who had sculpted the statue had already vanished deep into the Kateen Forest, so the citizens of Klaipeda repeatedly questioned Modestas for her name. {nl}
Despite the numerous questions nobody received an answer from Modestas. {nl}At any rate, this is the story of how the Goddess Statue of Klaipeda came to be. Even now that statue stands in the center of Klaipeda.{nl}
Since that time, whenever Modestas took on a wager, he always bet the same thing. The answer to the question of who the Statue of Klaipeda honored.{nl}To uncover the name of the goddess, numerous people challenged Modestas to a bet.{nl}
But no matter the impossible odds, Modestas never lost a bet. Therefore nobody was able to win the answer from Modestas for years and time flew by.{nl}
And, as he lay dying, Modestas revealed the secret to the Goddess Statue in his will. When all became clear, the one who orchestrated all of this was none other than the one whom all other goddesses stem from, Goddess Ausrine.{nl}
In the end, Goddess Ausrine, in exchange for giving income and an interesting life full of mystery to a certain gambler from Klaipeda, gave the city of Klaipeda a beautiful Goddess Statue, and a tale to last for times to come.{nl} {nl}

Another headache... I have a headache. Just go back and don't worry about me. {nl}Ah, the beautiful flowers are coming...
Eternal life... {nl}I continue to live by the authority of Goddess Ausrine.{nl}
The death moves away from me whenever I set Owl Sculptures that guide the spirits.{nl}Even if an old person like me could be helpful to the goddess and the world, I should live an eternal life.
Are you interested in eternal life?{nl}We necromancers control the dead so it's easy to figure out.{nl}
Absorbing another's vitality and extending one's own life is possible for me.{nl}But, it's not possible for humans.
Are you curious as to how I obtained eternal life?{nl}If stilled time is eternal, then you can consider it life everlasting.{nl}
I maintain a body that neither ages nor dies by stopping its time.{nl}I guess you could say its the same as being eternal.
What are you doing right now?
Wait. I will search with Monocle.
Monocle detected the special power. It's that way.

Historic Site Ruins
Historic Site Ruins (Recommended Lv : 90){nl}Only you and your party members can enter together.{nl}Are you sure you want to enter?
Right. Goddess Laima is the strangest of them all.{nl}No one knows when she disappeared. To be honest, I don't know if she really is a goddess.{nl}
Even if they say the world is doomed, our soldiers will guard this place until the end. {nl}However, we won't be responsible for you getting into trouble, so be careful.
Welcome. Sir Uska is waiting for you in the central square of Klaipeda. {nl}Well, is there anything that you are unsure of?
But this is also my ordeal and mission that Laima has seen. {nl}I will tell you Laima's message.{nl}
Welcome! What do you need? {nl}Unlike my previous items, I made my best effort to collect these.
I heard that the Revelator appeared and saved the Mage Tower. {nl}I can't imagine what would have happened to Fedimian if the Mage Tower fell. It's such a relief.{nl}Here, feel free to look around anytime.
Fedimian used to be crowded with pilgrims in the past. {nl}I heard someone protected the Great Cathedral, {nl}so I'm hoping it will be lively as it was during its glorious days.{nl}So, what kind of items are you looking for?
The red-haired wizard found the Revelator to save the Mage Tower {nl}even when there were other masters. He did save the Mage Tower so that was great but... {nl}Anyway, browsing's free so have a look around.
Now isn't this amazing? The Revelator who protected the Great Cathedral.{nl}We decided to not increase our prices, even though we are in tough times. Take your time.
Have you heard the rumor? Regarding the Mage Tower? {nl}A Revelator defeated the Demon Lord. {nl}If father was around, I would have given you some discounts to celebrate.
The people of Fedimian live by the teachings of Maven.{nl}But the Demon Lord dirtied it. The Revelators sure punished him for the goddess. {nl}Now, what do you want me to check?{nl}
I heard that some Revelator saved the Mage Tower. {nl}Fedimian should be safe now, right? {nl}Anyway, you might find some helpful items so look around. {nl}
The expectations on the Revelator from all the people of Fedimian is increasing. {nl}News has spread that a certain Revelator defeated the Demon Lord holding the Great Cathedral.{nl}Anyway, you don't necessarily have to buy something so feel free to look around.
(It looks like something is in the grass.)
What was she looking for even when she was dying? {nl}There's definitely a tragic story behind all this.
Then something snapped. {nl}A fellow clergyman, I can't remember who, had murdered Dion in his sleep with a mace and I... {nl}Everyone... {nl}No one can remember why they wanted to become priest in the past anymore.
Each Goddess Statue is known to have different abilities depending on which goddess it depicts. {nl}For example, the statue of Goddess Zemyna gives a blessing that enhances any ability you want.
But the statue of Goddess Ausrine in Klaipeda is a bit strange. {nl}It moves you to a desired area even though such a thing is Goddess Vakarine's power.
Go down quickly. It's dangerous. {nl}This place is empty.
(I cannot feel any magic from it.)
It's empty now.

Huh? How did you get up here?
Amazing.{nl}This must have been created hundreds of years ago...{nl}It seems to speak of you.{nl}
I don't feel any evil energy nor malicious intent in this.{nl}If so, this revelation must truly have come from the Goddess Laima...{nl}
I'm surprised about this talk of a 'Savior'.{nl}
Amongst the many Revelators, the one who can save the world and the goddesses...{nl}The revelation says you are that Savior.{nl}
You better keep quiet about this.{nl}Unless you want the demons looking for you.{nl}
I don't want to talk anymore about Saviors and such.{nl}Now, you should hurry back to Uska.{nl}
He will tell you where to go.{nl}May the goddess bless you in the future.
Receptionist Liam
What kind of request are you looking for?
Please be with someone you can trust.
We don't have a suitable request for you.{nl}Please look for it next time.
There is a request that is being progressed.{nl}Come see me again after finishing the request.
This request can be accepted by the party leader.
Thorny Vines Forest Dungeon
Thorny Vines Forest Dungeon (Recommended Lv : 175){nl}Only you and your party members can enter together.{nl}Do you want to enter?
It was a disaster... Many people were either injured or killed. {nl}Gentle creatures grew fierce and many new monsters emerged.{nl}
The best weapons and armors are the ones that you get used to over a long period of time. {nl}In order to do so, you must start by buying good items.
The things I sell are good both in price and quality.
A lot of people seem to be coming thanks to Sir Uska's recruitment notice.{nl}Take a look around at your own pace without feeling anxious.
The days were better when Commander Uska took care of Klaipeda.
Intelligence, calm judgment and cold rationality. {nl}These are the qualities required for our Cryomancers.{nl}These are the principles that will never change no matter what happens to the world.
Vain death is the only thing that lies at the end for those who simply seek to be audacious.{nl}If you wish to save the world, lift the shield of the Peltasta.
I heard the monsters are moving in herds outside Klaipeda.{nl}Instead of defeating them one by one, it will be better to learn my techniques.
My device will soon be functional. {nl}By the end of the day, you too will be able to enter the Mage Tower.
The thief who foolishly entered this tower to rob it was burned alive. {nl}At the very least, the monuments he left will serve as a warning to other trespassers. {nl}- Agailla Flurry
Commander Ruklys has fallen in battle, and the Fortress of the Land has been taken. {nl}Some people say he was killed by Lydia Schaffen's arrow,{nl}while others say by the royal magicians' magic, but it is certain that he passed away. {nl}It is indeed sad news.
There's no hope at all. Ah... my lovely Ridell. {nl}The Royal Army did not keep their words. We're all going to die.{nl}
Even if the world collapses, the people will remain.{nl}If you have the desire to win with trustworthy companions.
This too is my ordeal and duty which Laima foresaw... {nl}I will tell you Laima's message.{nl}
If I'm paid well, there's no reason I would stop a person who wants to learn my techniques.{nl}Rather, I would even welcome that person. {nl}That doesn't mean they should follow my every move, though.
Some Revelator drove out the demons in the Crystal Mine. {nl}That's just splendid news. {nl}Take your time and look around.
Have you heard the rumors about the Tenet Church?{nl}The Revelator may come see the goddess.{nl}I can also benefit from it in terms of my business.
I am so happy to hear such good news after you came here.{nl}I was very depressed about how the world would turn out. Ah, take your time to look around.
I heard the Crystal Mine may open again because of some Revelator.{nl}It doesn't cost you anything to look around, so take your time.
Have you heard what happened at the Crystal Mine?{nl}I heard one Revelator defeated the scary Demon Lord and I think it's so great.{nl}Please do not refuse and take your time to look around.
I was hoping that the goddess was at the Tenet Church, but I guess she wasn't.{nl}But, I am sure the Revelators will find her.{nl}So, I've decided not to raise the prices although we are having difficult times these days. {nl}Come check it out!
It is so good to hear that the Crystal Mine is opening again soon. {nl}I'd thought the world would've collapsed soon. {nl}Let's see, which equipment do you want me to take a look at?
The Revelator who saved the Tenet Church... I'd like to fix your equipment for free,{nl}but that is going to be hard due to the current circumstances.
It is great that the Revelator took back the Crystal Mine back from the hands of the demons.{nl}We feel embarrassed since it should have been retaken by us.
The Paladin Master could ask for our help...{nl}We would have caught the Demon King if he had done so.
I don't care who saved the Crystal Mine.{nl}Wasn't he a Cryomancer? I just hope he isn't a Pyromancer.
You saved the Tenet Church... But the goddess wasn't there, right?{nl}That's unfortunate. Everyone wished deeply to see the goddesses.
About the Crystal Mine, I don't know who the Revelator is, but he has done us a great deed.{nl}Should we just look for the goddesses now?{nl}
I thought the Tenet Church would not be influenced by Medzio Diena, {nl}but it turned into a demons' den.{nl}However, there is still hope. We just have to start again. 
I feel embarrassed that the Revelator has done something which the Masters couldn't do.{nl}Please don't misunderstand. It is not an inferiority complex.
I've heard about the Tenet Church. Isn't it great? {nl}The expectations of you are getting bigger at Klaipeda. You realize this, right?
I could not save all the people at the capital city on Medzio Diena. {nl}But, I heard some Revelator saved everyone at the Crystal Mine. It is very good indeed.
About the Tenet Church, I know those Watchers well.{nl}I wanted them to move to Klaipeda since the world is dangerous these days, {nl}but they told me they feel more comfortable at Gele Plateau.{nl}Everything turned out well because of you.
I want to research further about the sacred power,{nl}which the first Paladin Master created on Gele Plateau.{nl}If we somehow use that power, we may find a way to save the kingdom.
The Vubbes rushed out from the Crystal Mine because of the Demon Lord. {nl}But, I don't know why they took the villagers. Do you know something about this?
I can't believe it. Is the legend of Cunningham of the Crystal Mine for real?{nl}If that's so, where is she?
When I first saw the Revelator, I thought it was a trick by the demons...{nl}But, since he retook the Tenet Church, I really believe he may save the world.
I've heard about what happened at the Crystal Mine.{nl}I am sure the Revelators are the ones sent by the goddesses.
We are happy to hear that the Tenet Church was taken back from the hands of the demons.{nl}But, we still have a long way to go. We feel ashamed that we couldn't actively participate.
The goddesses always win.{nl}The defeat of the Demon Lord Mirtis by the Revelator is evidence.
Even though the goddesses aren't here, we have no doubts that we are going to win.{nl}The Revelator who protected the Tenet Church confirms that.
Everyone thought that the legend of Cunningham was just a story.{nl}But, since the Demon Lord at the Crystal Mine really appeared, who was that girl...
I've known the Paladin Master for a long time.{nl}He must have had some worries... You have done something great.
The Crystal Mine is the start of the ordeal.{nl}But, that is the sacred duty which you are responsible for.{nl}
When the great earth accepts the death and the stars in the sky draw the horizon...{nl}The seeker of truth who will stand on the line where births and deaths continue eternally.
Laima never showed herself in recorded history.{nl}And she was waiting for you while making the revelation in that long period.
Splendid. I've heard some Revelator defeated the Demon Lord.{nl}But, what was more surprising is that the legend of Cunningham is actually true.
I've pondered about many things since I heard that the Tenet Church was protected.{nl}All these disasters probably occurred for something way bigger than we could ever imagine...
I don't know who the Revelator is, {nl}but it's so great to hear that the Demon Lord at the Crystal Mine was defeated.{nl}Now, dreaming for a hope is not meaningless.
It was a good thing that the Tenet Church was protected,{nl}but I am more concerned about the well-being of the Paladin Master.{nl}On Medzio Diena, he focused on his recovery for a long time{nl}when he used the Divine Sphere in the capital.
I've heard the demons failed to occupy the Mage Tower because of the Revelator,{nl}who has appeared recently. But, if I was one of them, {nl}I would have prepared enough so that no one could try occupying the tower. {nl}Unlike what had happened to my family.
How dare a Demon Lord insult the teachings of Maven...{nl}Naktis has paid the price for it.
I have heard about the Revelator who drove out the demons from the Mage Tower.{nl}The Masters didn't do anything. Of course, I didn't do anything neither.
Everyone is just busy trying to survive after Medzio Diena, {nl}so they don't have time to think about going to the great cathedral.{nl}But everyone relies on the Great Cathedral. {nl}The Revelator completed a huge task.
I don't know who the Revelator is, but I could have saved Mage Tower better than the Revelator. {nl}Of course, my fees would have be met.
Even a person like me who goes after money, I know how important the Great Cathedral is.{nl}But, one thing that keeps my attention... The necklaces of the wise man, Maven. {nl}They are not in the hands of the demons right?
I came here by passing through rough winds and waves, {nl}while you've came here by going through the Thorny Vines Forest.{nl}You must be joking that you haven't found the goddesses. Seriously, how did you do that?
If the Mage Tower collapses, Fedimian won't be safe.{nl}The Demon Lord Helgasercle... the end of the obsession ends in such vain. 
Ever since the Revelators who dreamt of the goddesses appeared, {nl}the hands of the demons released them one by one.{nl}The same goes for the Great Cathedral. {nl}The proof that the Goddesses didn't abandon us is them.
Leaving the kingdom
A gigantic tree rose up from deep underground the capital city.{nl}The size of the tree was big enough that it couldn't even be compared against any mountain.{nl}As a result, many cities and towns were destroyed and many people lost their beloved ones.{nl}
But, the disaster did not end there.{nl}The evil energy started to surround the grounds and the monsters started to become feral. {nl}The demons started to attack.{nl}It was like an incurable disease, we didn't see any sign of recovery.
Still, the goddesses were no where to be found.{nl}The goddesses who we trusted disappeared without a trace and responded to nobody's prayers.{nl}People became mad and depressed, and soon only resignations were left behind.{nl}We started to prevent the chaos as much as we could, {nl}but as we did so, more misunderstandings were created. {nl}Death was always close-by and we gradually became dreary. 
We are becoming dreary to all the sadness and the pains.{nl}As if lifeless, we give up on everything and try not to do anything.{nl}It is like we are seeing the end of the history of the kingdom...{nl}We are just keep repeating the names of the goddesses.{nl}
I will end my writing here and leave the kingdom.{nl}I don't like my feeling of helplessness and the depressions.{nl}I am going to leave to a place where I can dream for hope again...
Savior...{nl}Laima told us that she had dreamt about the collapse of the world.{nl}And among many Revelators, one Savior would save everyone.{nl}
However, I cannot fully trust Laima's foresight.{nl}
For the Savior that would appear some day...{nl}I should have been responsible for the flames of the world, but I neglected my duties.{nl}
I thought the reason why I had to follow the revelation on behalf of Agailla Flurry,{nl}was related to her death and the ill-fated relationship with Helgasercle.{nl}
But, everything was accomplished as foretold by Laima.{nl}After Medzio Diena, I had to endure the long fight with my weak power.{nl}
Thanks for rescuing me, Savior.{nl}I should've listened to Laima sooner... and I regret the days in the past.
Perhaps I shall soon lose my breath. {nl}Pilgrims, may the blessings of the goddess be with you!
What was the thing she was looking for until the end?{nl}I am sure it has a sad story behind it.
Tree Root Crystals are slowly killing me.{nl}It feels as if I am drowning.{nl}
I have lost all desires. Am I dying? {nl}Eating and even breathing feels meaningless to me.{nl}
This surely isn't a teaching of Maven. {nl}Greed? Laziness? How can we call killing each other a lesson? {nl}I even envy Dion for dying first.{nl}
If only I had a little more time... {nl}The data I've collected near Dykyne Fork... I can't leave them...
The archer gives an arrow as a present, but the enemy take it as death.{nl}I think the world is like that now.
I will stay here with the Believers. {nl}I will somehow prevent the Thorn Forest from expanding any more.{nl}
Don't tell them about me for a while.{nl}Humans need a place to rely on...{nl}When they find out the powerlessness of the goddesses, this world will be filled with chaos and sighs.{nl}
The guardian of the Royal Mausoleum where the next revelation awaits is quite far from here.{nl}So I will open a portal for you as a shortcut.{nl}In the name of Saule, the goddess of the sun, I will pray for your safety.
Speaking of eternal life... look at Tesla. {nl}You would think that there is no aging in eternal life, don't you agree?
(There are barely legible words written here.) {nl}...Juros could not hold his breath any longer so he ended up inhaling the spores and died. {nl}Mushworts hunt people with the cruelest method I've ever seen. {nl}They walk around our gathering places and shake out mushrooms that release spores.{nl}
Even when the goddesses are not around, the Oracles still deliver the goddesses' message to people. {nl}Surely that is proof that the goddesses still exist.
Medzio Diena was not nature's will.{nl}After all, nature is governed by the goddesses, and they would never do harm to us all.
I offer this Goddess Statue, which I have put all my heart and soul into, to the goddess of great honor and light.
Among my disciples, two of them followed me until my latter years and they will also be my successors after my death. {nl}
...I am thinking whether I should thank the goddesses for this discovery or worry that my craving for knowledge could ruin the world.{nl}
I can't sleep well due to the fear of my research results being spread by interrogations from the demons. {nl}That's why I wish to pass the rest of the research to the one I can trust.
Are you interested in the eternal life?{nl}We, Necromancers control the dead, so it's easy when you think about that.{nl}
If he asks about the weather, then tell him that it will be sunny.{nl}Okay then, I will be counting on you as I wait.
If he asks about the weather, then tell him that it will be cloudy. {nl}Okay then, I will be counting on you as I wait.
If he asks about the weather, then tell him that it will be rainy. {nl}Okay then, I will be waiting for you.
I am a merchant selling goods at Fedimian.{nl}Do you need anything from me?
Yes, we have a long way to go so I hope it won't rain.{nl}The weather won't get bad today, right?
So you are the one sent by the Monk Master.{nl}We've received the goods well.{nl}Please send my gratitude to the Monk Master.
Is that so... I must hurry then.
Unfortunately, we don't have any goods to sell at the moment.
Be careful on your way back.
I'll never forgive the monsters that killed my family. {nl}Though my body returns to the ground, my soul still burns with anger. {nl}Oh, goddess. Only the cold blood of the monsters can cool my rage.
King Kadumel finally dies.
The balance of power between the demons and the goddesses, while fragile, has been stable for a long time.{nl}So long as they didn't cross each other's territories.{nl}
But, the demons broke through first.{nl}With the Petrifying Frost... even the spirits became stones.
As the demons started casting their petrification curse on this region, the goddesses tried to save the humans.{nl}However, the demons advised the goddesses that doing so would violate the rules that they mutually agreed to...
Excuse me for a bit. It is a horrible memory...{nl}They brought the catastrophe. {nl}A strong catastrophe which made goddesses to give up rescuing this place.
The goddesses already gave up rescuing once as they couldn't do anything on Medzio Diena.{nl}But, we can't just give up.
Savior.{nl}As you can see, I cannot do anything myself at the moment.{nl}As you have heard, after Medzio Diena my powers have become weak...{nl}
In this prison, a new disaster is about to happen.{nl}The demons are keep coming over from the dimensional crack,{nl}and they are trying to take this prison as their new camp.{nl}
I don't have any power left to close the dimensional crack.{nl}But, I think there is still a way.{nl}
Your help is the only way to turn this situation around.{nl}Since I am powerless, please lend me your power to close the dimensional crack.
Unforgivable.
Additionally, the heart of a Stoulet is required after offering the flowers.{nl}Do you wish to dedicate a Stoulet Heart in exchange for my blessing?
(A dubious black powder covers the pillar. Try scraping them off?)
(It's unreadable.)
(You can see number 1 on the pillar.)
(You can see number 2 on the pillar.)
(You can see number 3 on the pillar.)
(There is something vaguely written on the pillar. Is this a piece of symbol?)
Hammer? You need it to make a sanctum?
{nl}I can't give you what I was using so take this if you want. It will be gone once you use it. 
Hammer, I've already given it to you. Why are you asking for it again?
Repairing the Sanctum...
In usual circumstances, I would sell it, but I will just give it to you for free this time. {nl}But, it can be only used once.
You're too greedy. One will be enough.

The Monocle detected a special force. It's the box at the front.
So you are saying that there wasn't any special force or demons at the place where I've told you, and that only an old man who manages the Fortress of the Land was there, right? Did you tell him anything about me?
So you didn't tell him anything about me? That's good!
You need a certificate in order to go to the next region.
Wait! Can you hear something?
Stop thinking that this is a bad method. It's the best method that I can think of to help you at the moment.
Ruklys' Squad Member Spirit
I want to go beside the goddesses.
Premier Eminent
The revelation of the goddesses which we were looking for is near.
So you activated the magic circle again!
Even if I die, I will block you from obtaining the revelation!
My loyal subordinate, Mandara! Kill that arrogant Revelator!
It is so fortunate that I am able to see you again.
Do you remember when I asked you to check if the Monocle detected any strong powers?{nl}You've told me that there's only an old manager there. {nl}The things that we thought were hidden under the special force were actually demons. {nl}And even more absurd, the object that we felt the strong power was in fact the manager.
After I separated from you, I've been searching for Monocle... {nl}There were only demons at the place where the special force was detected.{nl}So I thought maybe Monocle can only be seen by the demons...
I will go to the left side. You go to the right side and look for the parts.
We were almost killed by the demons.
(This guard lost his consciousness. Let's pick up the bomb.)
We've succeeded distracting the guards.{nl}Let's go deep inside!
I don't want to meet you as an enemy next time.{nl}Let's return to where Delus is.
You're an intruder, but I guess we have no choice.{nl}I will go to the place where my colleagues are.
Darn... To think I have to ask an intruder for help...{nl}Anyway, I will return.
We can't just let go of your intrusion into the Fortress of the Land. {nl}Of course, we can't just forget about your help.
We appreciate for your help, but we can't just ignore the royal order.
Please get out of the Fortress of the Land.
Ruklys' Army Spirit
Take him to the goddess.
(The resistance has been weakened. I should use the Restraint Token.)
Premier Eminent is giving some orders to the demons.
I will be stationing one of our guards here in case you're planning to run away.
Beyond Pilgrim's Way is the Great Cathedral, which was built by Maven. {nl}Ruklys, Lydia Schaffen, and Agailla Flurry were all his disciples.{nl}
Among them, the Paladin Master was a hero who saved many lives in the capital. {nl}Currently, he has gone to Srautas Gorge to fight a great evil...
Many people made bets with Modestas to find out who the statue of the goddess is, but Modesta has never lost before he died.
By the end of my life I hope to see Fedimian completely restored.{nl}If there's one thing I can do, I can make 1,000 pots in dedication to this wish.
I hope I can make it big off of the excavation site at Zachariel's Royal Mausoleum...
I beg to the goddess. {nl}I hope the day when my oath to the Watchers is realized never comes...
When I close my eyes at last, I hope my many disciples will protect me at my side.
Now is the moment that we become one with our blades. My last wish is to die beside the one I love.
Why did you come back?{nl}
It is so fortunate to hear that Grazina is okay.{nl}But, I guess Grazina can't be relaxed since she gave this to me.{nl} 
This is the second page of the Roxona Conflict that I gave to you a while ago.{nl}It was among the objects which Grazina stole. Please receive it.{nl}
And Alina... I am not sure.{nl}She ran to the lower side so I think she may be near there.
You've passed the object and the story of Grazina.
Please find Alina...
2nd page of the Roxona Conflict
The time went by and the summer, the season of new green leaves came...{nl}Lydia Schaffen wandered around to find the one who'd killed her parents and relatives.{nl}The goddesses were on her side after all.{nl}The time that she's been waiting for has finally come.{nl}
One by one they fell in the dark to her unexpected arrows.{nl}Although it should have been an easy fight for them, they never knew where she was.{nl}The sound of her arrows ripped through air and skin.{nl}Soon there were no one other than Lydia Schaffen, who stood still.{nl}
Lydia Schaffen raised her torch.{nl}The flame wavered ominously, causing her shadow to waver as well...{nl}She wanted to see the faces of the villains who killed her parents and neighbors as well as burnt the village.{nl}Many of the faces she saw for the first time, but some of them were familiar.{nl}They were loyal subordinates of Ruklys and she knew very well about them.{nl} If it had been a brighter time and different location, she may have noticed the incident before it occurred.{nl}But, the incident had occurred and it was irrevocable.{nl}Just as Lydia Schaffen had her reasons to kill her enemies, Ruklys now had his: to defeat her for killing his subordinates.{nl}
With a gloomy sense of shame and unfamiliar embarrassment, {nl}she quietly picked up her bow and left the place.{nl}The news soon reached Ruklys.{nl}They both comforted themselves by thinking that they just fell into a wicked plan.{nl}But, it was useless. They felt the vague shadow of the wicked plan behind them.{nl}
But, it was too late.{nl}There was nothing she could do except for put an end to Ruklys, {nl}with the arrows that she now love and hate.{nl}Or else his sword will guide her to the goddesses... There was nothing she could do. 
There is one more thing I must tell you. {nl}Follow the name of Ruklys.{nl}
His final battleground...{nl}Laima's revelation at the Fortress of the Land is waiting for you.{nl}
Goddess Laima...{nl}The Revelator who you foretold has finally come...{nl}
After a thousand years of sleep, I am finally able to meet you, {nl}the one whose coming the goddess foretold.{nl}I am also relieved to see that the effort I put into building {nl}the Royal Mausoleum during my rule was not futile.{nl}
Although I founded the kingdom,{nl}I wish to speak to you as the guardian of the revelation rather than as king.
You are the Savior of this kingdom.{nl}I can feel that you will save this world and become the one who the goddesses would rely upon.{nl}
After spending a thousand years of worshiping the providence of the goddess,{nl}I shall now show you the great will that was left to you in the revelation.
The soldiers will die if I don't make it. {nl}I have to be strong. 
...Only after three years since Ruklys learned from my teachings...
If the demons cross the dimensional crack, {nl}and join hands together with their brethren at the Demon Prison...{nl}The world will be in for another kind of threat.
I've told sister Vakarine to promise me that she'd prepare for the worst.{nl}But the uprising of the demons that broke through might be hindering her.
Bishop Aurelius, who was ordained at a young age, soon took ill and lost his life.{nl}
His last request was for the Divine Mission for Maven to be fulfilled even after his death, {nl}and the Church accepted.
I am sorry, Officer Gorman.{nl}I couldn't complete the mission due to the monsters' attacks.{nl}
Take some rest. It is fortunate that you came back alive.{nl}I will pass the mission to another person.
You will have to think a lot since when you touch on something, {nl}many things that are near get also influenced.{nl}I will write down which one to turn on. I am counting on you.
Let's see... For now, just activate the shrine above.{nl}When you activate one, the shrines near it would get also influenced, {nl}so you will have to think a lot.
Let's see... For now, just activate the shrine on the left.{nl}When you activate one, the shrines near it would get also influenced,{nl}so you will have to think a lot.
Let's see... For now, just activate the shrine on the right.{nl}When you activate one, the shrines near it would get also influenced,{nl}so you will have to think a lot.
Let's see... For now, just activate the shrine below.{nl}When you activate one, the shrines near it would get also influenced,{nl}so you will have to think a lot.
The Order of the Tree of Truth worships the Divine Tree that stands in the capital city.{nl}The greeds of the humans are getting bigger, so the Divine Tree is punishing them for it.{nl}
The Order of the Tree of Truth will be the ones selected by the Divine Tree,{nl}and they will help starting to build a new era.
Margiris once told us. The salvation can't be achieved easily.{nl}What we are doing is washing off the sins of the ignorant ones and washing off our sins.{nl}The ones who die are because they are weak. Only the survivors would receive the salvation.
The ones who came to this place before Utara came here are the guys from{nl}the Order of the Tree of Truth.{nl}They are the disciples acknowledged by Goddess Zemyna.{nl}
This land is blessed by Goddess Zemyna, so they thought they should make a will of the goddess.{nl}How can I stop it.
Fake Box
It doesn't seem to be this box.
It's not enough to destroy the Holy Relic of the Order, but you did release Carlyle...{nl}
You will pay with your life!

The divine energy subsided when the Truth Token was lit.
The mysterious girl with the light has appeared. Talk to her.
The mysterious girl ran away without saying anything. Follow her.
Suspicious Basket
The stench offends your nose. Looks like rotten food is hidden underneath.
The mysterious girl with the light has appeared once again.
Quickly! We have no time!{nl} My power is over here!
Aldona! Zydrone!{nl}Now!
Aldona, Zydrone...{nl}I'm sorry for being a burden to you both because of my feebleness.{nl}
But, let's not waste any time.{nl}You've brought the Savior here... who has the power to get rid of this disaster.{nl}
I will ask the Savior to help me.{nl}You two should get ready to quickly make the Evening Star Key.{nl}
The many deaths of demons could not fill the emptiness in my heart. {nl}Once the goddess' great mission for me is over, {nl}I will be left with a long life full of boring moments.
Ugh, I thought it would die after its throat had been cut.{nl}I hope it can just behave now and die slowly.
A fake revelation... all this so you can lure me out and get rid of me?{nl}How disappointing to see such trickery is the best that Laima can prepare.
But for all your preparations, you are powerless against me...{nl}It's amusing how your foolishness blinds you from the overwhelming gap of power between us.
Right. I can feel where the real revelation is located.{nl}Try struggling once more.
So, this is where the revelation is hidden.
Demon Lord Marnox
Such are the fools who follow the goddesses.{nl}Have you not witnessed enough to know me?{nl}All this time I've been waiting for you all to come at your own will.
After I defeat you, I will continuously disturb the priest until he opens the box himself.
I was able to retrieve my soul thanks to you... {nl}Isn't this the Chain of Reversion that shredded my soul?
Collecting the Shiny Moss
Obtained Shiny Moss!
Failed to obtain the moss!
Obtained Nachi Mushroom!
So, this stone slate is the Light of Salvation?{nl}It looks like just an old slate to me.
A new disaster is brewing in this prison.{nl}The demons are invading through the dimensional crack, {nl}and are trying to take over this prison as a new base.{nl}
{nl}I would say that the world has grown to such a state that it cannot live without us.{nl}Developing the Crystal Mines, providing construction materials to the Astral Tower and the Great Cathedral.{nl}We, the Kedora Merchant Alliance, are the ones that made such feats possible.
{nl}However, areas nearby suffered enormous damage on Medzio Diena. {nl}A great deal of our original power was lost, and thereafter, we could only do what we knew we could do.
Behold.{nl}This is the result of the great disaster.
However, it seems like the disaster has only begun.{nl}The demons are looking for the Light of Salvation.{nl}
At this rate...{nl}All life in this world will come to an end.{nl}
I ask for your help...{nl}
Only you...{nl}Only the Revelator can save this world.{nl}
Please go to Klaipeda. {nl}And please... do everything you can to keep the Light of Salvation safe from the demons.
While I may have built my sanctum here, {nl}the materials for making a goddess scripture is found elsewhere. {nl}Thus, we have founded this religious organization,{nl}to look for the records of the Ancient Sages of the Rhud Order.

They say what is the use in the world with disappeared goddesses, but we believe goddesses will one day return and save us.{nl}Is it wrong to pray so that the day will come sooner?{nl}These monuments were built with our devotion from our praying hearts.{nl}Until some strange person came and destroyed the monuments, it symbolized our prayers.
If it's a normal monument, we prayed to release such an aura.[nl]It's not some corruption!{nl}Working under someone who neither understand or can hear, did the person who destoryed our monuments saw it as a corruption?
Do you finally understand?{nl}What your utter stupidity has caused?{nl}If you understand, start trying to think of a way to revert this.{nl}This can't simply be ignored.
Below, I believe there's someone destroying Nestospa's Monuments by disguising as Anastospa.{nl}Can you go and investigate?{nl}It might be dangerous, take this flare.{nl}Be careful.
Kedora Merchant Alliance Notice
Recruiting new members for the Kedora Merchant Alliance!
Nestospa Member
A goddess scripture can be be made by paper and binding of leather straps found in Genra Field.
Thrown away Gedas' research materials.
The flare went off. Fabijus is in danger.
Now. Let's see.
Oh, I think I found it.{nl}You see that box over there? That's it.
Why are there only seniors there?{nl}Darn... Is this monocle a sham?{nl}
Though, it's good that the senior knew about the revelation you've been looking for.{nl}Anyway, did you talk about me?{nl}You did well, you did well.{nl}
Anyway, it seems that you need a certification to head down to another area.{nl}Can you leave a note so that I can get a certification later as well?{nl}
There's something I need to find out.{nl}Let's go our separate ways while keeping in contact with each other. Do you understand?
Huh? What is this...{nl}My strength... My body... It's crumbling?{nl}
No! How dare you ruin six hundred years of my work?!{nl}All my efforts ruined by a human... To a lowly human!!
My faithful Mandara!{nl}Shred that ignorant Revelator!!{nl}
Ruklys... It won't go your way...{nl}Never... The revelation...
Saviors, who followed all the way here by having faith in the revelation.{nl}You are gradually getting closer to the truth.{nl}
Savior. What does the Divine Tree mean to humans?{nl}A symbol of calamity, the roots of everyone's sorrow in this land...
No.{nl} That's the image created by the crooked hearts of the demons.{nl}
In the beginning... There was God.{nl}
A sky with dancing stars, land to support that sky...{nl}It was all created together with humans and other lives.{nl}
And thus the world was created.{nl}The God who painted the world with radiance had fallen to an eternal dream.{nl}
The Divine Tree. It is another form that God has taken for himself.{nl}The God had turned into a tree that will breathe life force out to the world, {nl}making the world complete.{nl}
We are beings that are born to groom the world and the Divine Tree...{nl}The God has asked us to not wake him up from his slumber.{nl}
Thus, we lived side by side in the new peaceful age.{nl}However, there began a feeling of thirst within some.{nl}
The fact that God is not by us.{nl}The moment that people realized the absence of God was the source of their thirst, {nl}we could no longer live together.{nl}
In the end, the thirst that has craved for God had grown into obsession for awakening the God.{nl}They threw away the name that God had given them, {nl}and took the mantle named "Demon" within them.{nl}
The obsessions... It has brought calamity upon this world.{nl}In order to be loved... They had decided they needed to disobey God's words and awaken him.{nl}
Savior.{nl}You are the one that will take God's revelation, {nl}and save the world from the demons and truly make the world complete.{nl}
The time is nigh.{nl}I will wait in the cruel place that the tyrant has carved out.
Ruklys Army Soldier's Spirit
Escape...
Tracking
(No bloodstain or corpse to be seen.)
Insurgent's Journal
We just wanted to create a world where we can live happily.{nl}We just wanted to stop the tyrannous monarch.{nl}
So we gathered under the flag of Commander Ruklys.{nl}We were able to stand up and resist due to the support of Chancellor Premier Eminent.
However, Premier Eminent didn't give a single hair about our resistance.{nl}It was all planned meticulously from the very beginning.{nl}Only to take over the Fortress of the Land...{nl}
We were swung around like idiots.{nl}The monarch becoming tyrannous, ordering Commander Ruklys to attack the hometown of Lydia Schaffen, and Lydia retaliating to our resistance because of it was all according to his plan.
When the Royal Army said that they will spare our lives when we surrender at Roxona City,{nl}we knew that it was a sugarcoated lie.{nl}If they were really willing to spare our lives, Commander Ruklys would already have surrendered.{nl}As long as Eminent was widely known throughout the world. We knew this was a lie to tormemt our ranks.{nl}
Soon, the demons' full out assault led by Eminent will begin.{nl}We won't survive, and we won't be able to say anything.
And for what?{nl}What could possibly be in the Fortress of the Land that Commander Ruklys were fighting so hard about?{nl}A simple soldier like me cannot come to understand..{nl}
Commander Ruklys said that he will go meet Lydia Schaffen for the last time.{nl}He said that as long as he sacrificed, we would be able to stop everything.
The Xth of X, Year 45X{nl}-{nl}Construction has reached its last stage.{nl}Commander Ruklys said we would soon be able to leave the fortress construction site.{nl}The only job left was to create a magic circle based on the design given to us by the magicians.{nl}Since Ruklys himself is checking up on us, we can't go easy on the job.{nl}
The Xth of X, Year 45X{nl}-{nl}Thanks to the residents of Roxona, the construction might finish sooner than planned.{nl}Although my superior fear that the fortress' security might leak from all this help, I believe Ruklys wants to prioritize on finishing the construction.
The Xth of X, Year 45X{nl}-{nl}There's a bad rumor going around.{nl}The monarch of Kadumel isn't too pleased with the construction itself.{nl}It won't really matter what that dumb monarch thinks as long as there's Chancellor Eminent's contribution to the construction.{nl}
The Xth of X, Year 45X{nl}-{nl}The fortress magic circle and its defensive system is truly spectacular!{nl}Only Ruklys and the goddesses can understand how the fortress will differentiate between us and the Royal Army.{nl}
The Xth of X, Year 45X{nl}-{nl}The dreaded prediction has come true.{nl}We received news that the Royal Army was on their way.{nl}I also heard that the monarch of Kadumel himself had stepped in.{nl}What in the world is that so called wise chancellor doing?{nl}I'm starting to doubt his reputation.{nl}
The Xth of X, Year 45X{nl}-{nl}Those soldiers seem only royal and experienced with its name.{nl}Even if the order came from their own monarch, do they even know who they are daring to fight?{nl}Do they not know what kind of person Ruklys is even after facing him?{nl}It seems that thing over their shoulder doesn't even contain brains.{nl}If not, the monarch of Kadumel was truly out of his mind.
264th day of the War{nl}-{nl}A friend who's acting as Ruklys' advisor told me that Kadumel is conspiring with a group of thieves to overturn the situation.{nl}To stop this, Ruklys with his chosen elite troops will leave the fortress in secret.{nl}Telling me to keep the secret at all costs, my friend had a very serious look on his face.{nl}
275th day of the War{nl}-{nl}After the secret mission, Ruklys' complexion didn't look too good.{nl}The plan seems to have succeeded with the words going around, but there's a worry that there might be some another problem.{nl}Their numbers and supplies of the Royal Army is far superior to ours, but there's no one to make use of the power and take control.{nl}In the long term, it seems certain that we will be victorious, but the the air between us seemed anxious.{nl}
311th day of the War{nl}-{nl}Unbelievable news.{nl}Legendary marksman Lydia Schaffen has sided with the Royal Army.{nl}Although I tried to calm my subordinates by asking whether she was better than our Commander Ruklys, but once the anxiety and nervousness spreads, there's nothing we can truly do about it.{nl} 
324th day of the War{nl}-{nl}We've become sure of this after this fight.{nl}Premier Eminent, who not only the world compliments and say he's been at hard work to support the ignorant monarch was the absolute evil in the entire world.{nl}The monarch's temper might be aggressive, but there's no one else that can plan and act the evil deeds that the foolish monarch can't simply think of himself.{nl} 
325th day of the War{nl}-{nl}We cannot win...{nl}If we were to lose this war, the most regrettable thing would be that we won't be able to spread the words that Eminent that even the goddess won't be able to save, and that the world will still believe him as a chancellor who protect the kingdom.{nl}Not only does he use the monarch as a shield to carry out his evil deeds, but he also plants the fault on the monarch himself.{nl}
331st day of the War{nl}-{nl}No matter how this war ends, if given the chance, I want to kill the chancellor.{nl}If we emerge victorious, I will ask Ruklys to have me execute him, and if we fail, I will at least want to charge at his barricade and stab his chest with a blade; even if I die in the process.{nl}Eminent has started to take over the Earth Tower while leading the demons.{nl}As a human being, how dare he join forces with the demons...?
Ferret
Demon. Came and planted. Totem.{nl}Ferret. Touched totem. Ferret stronger.{nl}Ferret win human!
Human days over. Ferret days now!{nl}Fruits bigger. Cowardly humans ran away.{nl}Humans unworthy! Ferrets chase away!
Demons help ferrets. 
The freed girl has ran away somewhere with urgency.
The girl stared at me as if she wanted me to follow her.
Urbonas
From succession, We've spent a long time preparing to greet the Revelator.
Gathering Shining Moss.
Pouring the Blood
The Bracken Herb is rotting.
Collapsed Residential Quarters
Collapsed Residential Quarters (Recommended Lv : 160){nl}Only you and your party members can enter together.{nl}Do you want to enter?
Are you the one who rescued us?{nl}Then we shall lend you our power.
Thank you for saving us from this awful work.{nl}It might be a little, but please accept my power.
How hard it has been... If it weren't for you, we would've spent eternity working.{nl}Thank you. Let me share you my power.
Take this power.{nl}If this awful tower can be destroyed, I will do anything.
By any chance, are you going to leave after receiving our power?{nl}Since it's request by the Chief Owl Sculpture, I will lend you my power.
My power may be too weak since it hasn't been long since I recovered my conscious.{nl}However, I hope that even this small amount of power may help.
Letter
Even after running away from the demons that have invaded the castle, it'll be hard to survive.{nl}If anyone get ahold of this letter, please pass it on to Jurus... Eras

And so, I decided to take an aggressive approach.{nl}Even if it meant that I would be targeted by the demons.
The area nearby us is the Kedora Merchant Alliance's excavation site.{nl}Be cautious to cause no disturbance to the excavation.

It's not that I know every people of the Anastospa...{nl}I know quite well of people from same platform.{nl}
Besides, those tombstones! It's suppose to release crimson energy.{nl}We were gathering holy energy to offer to the goddesses!{nl}
Thank you for helping.{nl}We can take care of the rest.{nl}Let me thank you again.
Requirement to create scripture is faith's
There are some who doubt the use of trying when the goddesses have disappeared.{nl}However, we believe that the goddesses will return one day and save us!{nl}
Is it wrong to pray so that the day will come sooner?{nl}
These tombstones were built with our devotion from our praying hearts.{nl}Until some strange person came and destroyed the tombstones, it was used for all our rites!
It's supposed to release crimson energy, it's not a corruption!{nl}We were gathering holy energy to offer to the goddesses!{nl}
Since you carry such malice, monsters must be attracted to you!{nl}That's it! It was created that way!{nl}
Working under someone who neither understand or can hear!{nl}Did the person who destroyed our tombstones saw it as a corruption?
Do you finally understand?{nl}What your utter stupidity has caused?{nl}
If you understand, start trying to think of a way to revert this.{nl}This simply cannot be ignored.
I have a request for an investigation{nl}It's the person disguised as Anastospa and destroying Nestospa tombstones.{nl}
The name is Alvydas. He was at Liugas Access Road.{nl}It might be dangerous, take this flare. Be careful.
A healing potion needed for a dog.
That's a healing potion. I will feed it to the dog when you hand it over.
I will head to where Rose is residing.
Although it may look simple at first glance, {nl}the path of the Swordsman carry some profound meanings.
I wish there will be more swordsmen capable of helping the villagers.
Offense is the best defense{nl}There is nothing to fear if you can blow away enemies, {nl}like the fallen leaves with your two-handed sword.
There are many brilliant people among the masters that did not let their feminine body {nl}affect their training. If I train diligently, I would be able to catch up to them some time.
I welcome any swordsman with an aptitude. {nl}Let's defeat the demons together!
You could say it were the demons that made it possible for us to reach a sub-master level,{nl}at such a young age. {nl}I will repay them with my sword and shield.
It's already been four years, but there are many people who still carry the scars of that day.{nl}In times like these, our cleric's blessing by the goddess must be shared.
Oh, are you traveling?{nl}I envy you~ I'm stuck here because of a mission...
To spread the blessing of the goddess, it doesn't matter what kind of priest you are.{nl}
Originally, I was following a different path, but I ended up entering the Krivis.{nl}I believe helping others through a conventional way seems most appropriate.
For the tired and sick people, we must become a shoulder for them to rest on.{nl}As such, priests must bear with heavy responsibilites.
With the goddesses gone, we need to be the one to help hold people's heart in place.
Are you asking me to bless the path of the Priest? Course, I would be happy to bless you.{nl}I pray that your path will be brimming with the blessing of the goddess. 
Anyone who shares the blessing of the goddess has the right to be blessed by anyone.{nl}I pray that the goddess will watch over his future.
You must be someone who has recently pursued the path of the Priest.{nl}If you don't mind my blessing, I will gladly bless you.
It's regrettable that someone like you has left the path of the Cleric half-way through.
I was originally a Pardoner.{nl}If the path of the Priest ends up not working out for you, consider the path of the Krivis.
Of course, helping others through a conventional way is still great.{nl}However, make sure not to forget the choice of the Bokor.
The state of the world after Medzio Diena has truly gotten much better, {nl}but the world is still in a chaotic state. {nl}{nl}The dedication of people who are worthy is desperately needed.
That enormous tree was the cataclysm as well as the monsters. I'll acknowledge that.{nl}However, the kingdom and its people are responsible for the chaotic events{nl}that occurred afterward. {nl}If Medzio Diena were to occur at our hometown, this kind of situation would've never happened.
Pepole like you hoping to straighten out the chaos are interesting.{nl}It's a forte that only a handful of people carry in this kingdom.
We, the Bokor, are the clergy that are meant to spread the blessing of the goddess to the world.{nl}It's just that our methods are a bit unfamiliar.
Ahaha. Did you think that the Bokors would have dark personalities?{nl}It seems that misunderstanding of the Bokors has spread far in the public eye.
There are already many splendid people at Orsha.{nl}I have come here to this place to get closer to meet with people who are having difficulties.
The meeting with Tesla was a luck of a lifetime.{nl}It'd be great if he would message of his current whereabouts.
I don't believe it's much of a trouble.{nl}For someone who has dedicated their loyalty to the kingdom, {nl}they must be able to sacrifice their life for the subjects of the kingdom in times like these.
Please don't get surprised.{nl}This fluid is created by Sadhu's ability to help the people of Orsha located around here.
Paladins like us prove the faith of the goddess through our strengths.{nl}It is our job to protect the people from the monsters or the demons.
When my uncle finishes his mission, the responsibilites will be handed down to me.{nl}However, through my ability as a Paladin, I want to protect the kingdom and serve the goddess.{nl}If my current ability is mastered, I wish to work towards the mastery of another system.
Find the ferret's hideout and season the stolen food with the crimson water.{nl}The ferrets hide the stolen foods between the fruit baskets.{nl}
Ah! The ferrets have stolen beef jerky this time.{nl}The ferrets are absolutely fond of beef jerkys. {nl}Find the stolen beef jerkeys and make sure to corrupt them.
Chase after the girl!{nl}She must not meet with the Revelator!
Finally found you! The ferrets do have their uses.
There seems to be a fly hidden among us... Find and eliminate them.
Halt! You must not be an average fly to make it this far.
Perfect timing, my body was starting to turn stiff.{nl}Don't you dare think you'll return alive. Grasshopper!
Don't think this is the end... If you think I'll let you rescue Lada, think again!
I cannot hand over the Kruvina to you!
Since it's become to this, I will use the power of Kruvina to crush you!
What are you doing... Beholder...{nl}This is none of your concern!
This is Giltine's power.{nl}This desirable power is of no importance to someone like you. 
In return, hand over the power that Giltine has approved.
Thank you for rescuing us. If it weren't for your light, it might have become dangerous.{nl}I will return back to town and inform that the ferrets have appeared.
The ferrets play dead in critical situations.
The ferrets are curious animals and eats whatever they have yet to see.
My eyes met with the ferret who's been looking around. The ferret looks bored.
The ferrets are nocturnal and seems to sleep a lot during the day.
The ferrets are carnivorous animals and doesn't seem to like fruits that much.
Demons. Set up. Totem.{nl}Totem. Touch. Ferrets become stronger.{nl}Ferrets. Win against humans!
The fruit has become bigger. Run away coward humans.{nl}No human qualifications! Ferrets will scare them away!
Demons. Helps the ferrets. Demons. Turned ferrets stronger.{nl}Demons. Tried to protect. Humans. Cannot come closer.{nl}Then demons. Continue to help the ferrets.
This ferret doesn't hold a single interest to converse with me.
The mysterious girl has run off to Zeraha without a word. Let's follow her. 
Beef Jerky cannot be found here.
Only fruits can be seen from this basket.
This must be the wrong basket.
The girl appeared and asked me to follow her.
Black Soul
I can feel the flow of enigmatic power after burning the black soul of the demons.
Whispers can be heard to take them to the soul altar.
I thought they would come to rescue their comrade, but...{nl}The wrong person seem to be caught.
You seem to be doing well in my governed prison.{nl}You might be the Revelator that miss Giltine has spoken of.{nl}But, even the Revelator is merely a human... I, Marnox cannot be resisted against!
I can't waste time with you.
This should be enough.
Acquiring Bracken Herb.
Acquired Bracken Herb!
Acquired Herb!
Burn the box filled with braken.
The box filled with bracken has been burnt.
And to protect you...{nl} I could do no more than to hide you amongst many other Revelators.
Advance to 7th Rank?
Vain death is the only thing that lies at the end for those who simply seek to be audacious.{nl}If you wish to save the world, lift the shield of the Peltasta.
Please protect the Namott Barrier located at the summit of the valley.{nl}I will dispose the rest of the mess when the brothers arrive.
Welcome. I heard you were coming from Uska. {nl}Don't just stand there. I wish to have a word with you.
Hiya, sorry about the mess.{nl}Please understand, it's currently still difficult for us to recover.{nl}Is there anything you want to store?
First of all, magic must be strong.{nl}Using powerful spells to unleash powerful magic is basic.{nl}What can you do with weak magic?{nl}
To become a stronger mage, you cannot idle around and ignore practice.{nl}Well, you might still be able to catch up to talented people such as myself.
It's very important to maintain a relaxed mind when using magic.{nl}Not only can you not be able to use magic when losing your composure, {nl}you might also find yourself in danger.{nl}Those who use magic should keep their heads and hearts calm at all times.
Delicate control is required for higher ranked magic.{nl}A minor mistake may lead to a fatal result.{nl}You must not forget this as you get more skillful and handle more variety of magic.
An advice from me?{nl}Speaking as a Linker, you must have a wide perspective.{nl}There are many cases of those mages who uses synergy magic, {nl}without checking their surroundings as they want to cast magic as soon as possible.{nl}
Not only do you have to watch for yourself and your enemies, {nl}but you must as well have to be in the head of your comrade in arms.{nl}If you don't plan the effects of your magic ahead, {nl}you are no different than those reckless novice soldiers swinging their swords around carelessly.

Psychokino's Potential
After the lord's migration has fallen, the people of the south are heading towards Orsha.{nl}If you're an adventurer who has recently started traveling, head to camping area on the east.{nl}There should be people who are able to guide you.
I saw Orsha from a slope on the way here from a town.{nl}The splendor surrounded by a castle wall I've seen as a kid has disappeared,{nl}and now coiled with trees with the size of a house.{nl}I wonder how long you can last in such a place.
It's obviously Intelligence for the Wizard and its branch.{nl}However, you also need to remember Spirit to cast spells frequently.{nl}Select well between balance and concentration.
It's obviously Strength for the Archer and its branch.{nl}However, you cannot forget nimble Dexterity.{nl}It's best to think ahead of what to become.
It's obviously Intelliegence for the Cleric and its branch.{nl}However, you may also require Strength or Spirit.{nl}It's best to think ahead of what to become.
Only if our town also had an inn for merchants to stay and rest.{nl}We could've prepared beforehand...{nl}After spending so long at an inlet of a valley, we got to suffer for not knowing the world affairs.
Living there inside of Orsha's partially destroyed fortress.{nl}Living here with swarming monsters and fear of safety.{nl}Both are tough choices to make.{nl}I wish to return back to my hometown...
Please let the people with the smell of the ocean to head down to Dallanas.{nl}It's starting to become uneasy with the people not to be seen as time passes.{nl}By any chance, did they all leave to Orsha without me?
There's no way that such a huge amount of people can enter Orsha.{nl}That's why we try to gather and accommodate them here as much as possible.
Lethargy and fear can be seen in people's eyes.{nl)What would you do if you were the village chief?
{nl}It's the elderly's complaint...{nl}I worry for the lord...
Those who are usually lazy are still carefree in these times of danger.{nl}People who were suppose to arrive early have yet to come.
This land has been protected by the ancestors of my family.{nl}I will protect this land, no matter what hardship comes my way.{nl}Please lend me your power.
There has been no case of demons being involved during the several years I spent as a chaser.{nl}I believe we have seen all the demons within this area.
The rumors about you are incredible.{nl}It has spread all around Orsha.
I will have to revisit my hometown after this task.{nl}I wish to see my parents after experiencing such a horrible event.
I don't believe there are more important tasks over at Orsha than here.
I pray that all the informants are safe.
To survive in such a world, a chaser should be more suitable than a hunter.{nl}
Please find Urbonas instead of worrying about me.
Please save us from Marnox's grasp.
I miss the days of the peaceful Orsha.{nl}Those days are never coming back, right?
The demons are coming down from the west.{nl}The events at Ashaq Basement Prison was just the beginning.{nl}How many more sacrifices will have to be done...{nl}I wonder how much longer we can protect Orsha.
All the wounds have yet to heal.{nl}We will leave when we are able to walk.
It's awful to believe that I could've disappeared.
By any chance have you seen my cargo left at the Woods of the Linked Bridges?{nl}It should've had my mother's keepsake and other various items...
When you leave this area, you will become a priest, {nl}that will further devote to the goddess' words...{nl}I pray that you return safely.
Chaser Daramaus
What kind of wealth and honor is Torvana enjoying and followed me here to a such a place...{nl}I must apologize to Torvana when I safely return from this place.
Chaser Torvana
I followed here since Pranas usually has an acquaintance...{nl}But I did not know the fact that he was someone acting on such a reckless behavior.
Before the kingdom's capital was ruined, {nl}the kingdom's dispatched officers have been ransacking and annoying us...{nl}I miss those old times.
I believe all the hardships here has become an experience.{nl}There are many stories to tell my kids when I return back to my hometown.
I remember the time when they were recruiting chasers back at my hometown for the first time.{nl}I followed here by trusting in my brother, but there are simply too many tasks.{nl}Not to mention seriously dangerous.
I have figured a way to live more diligently back at my hometown.{nl}I wish to see my family...
If I can't handle this and runaway, I'll become a deserter...{nl}When this task is over, I will have to seriously consider being discharged.{nl}But if that does happen, I wouldn't know how I will from then on.
After this work is over, {nl}I'll be requesting for a vacation to spend my days sleeping with my warm blanket.
Lord's Guard
The lord is extremely busy.{nl}Trivial matters should be inquired with a different manager.
There are too many people requesting to meet with the lord.{nl}Eventually, the lord has decided to leave the castle wall to calm the crowd.
Welcome back! This is the commercial district of Klaipeda.{nl}You will find all sorts of accessories and equipment being sold here.
Welcome! Here to drop something off?
Nameless Demon
Chase after the girl!{nl}She must not meet with the Revelator!
Finally found you! The ferrets do have their uses.
There seems to be a fly hidden among us... Find and eliminate them.
Halt!{nl}You must not be an average fly to make it this far.{nl}
Did your legs froze from fear?{nl}Or do you actually believe a human like you can handle my axe?{nl}
Then, I shall send you to your beloved goddess' side!
Don't think this is the end... If you think I'll let you rescue Lada, think again!
Yes...{nl}It'll be destroyed by your hands...
I will crush everything with Kruvina's power!!
What are you doing... Beholder...{nl}This is none of your concern!!
That idiot...{nl}Did he forget about miss Giltine's mission?{nl}
This power is something you cannot bear.{nl}
However, that Revelator...{nl}...certainly needs to be eliminated.{nl}
Zaura.{nl}The sin for forgetting my mission will be repaid with that Revelator's head.{nl}
Here. This is the power that miss Giltine has endowed you.{nl}This power is sufficient even without Kruvina's power.{nl}{nl}
Just now... A female child?{nl}Am I correct?{nl}
What is that strange light...{nl}What is happening?{nl}
...I will first return back to town and inform that the ferrets have appeared.{nl}Thanks for rescuing me.
I pray to the goddess hoping that my prediction is correct.{nl}Oh right, you do know that bonfire has to be burnt with firewood?{nl}
Demon Goddess Giltine
Laima's wings...{nl}It's beautiful every time I look at it...
However, I do not like the color.
Look.{nl}The side with the crimson color is much more beautiful...
Are you regretting the decision?{nl}I can feel it. We are sisters after all...
Does it hurt a lot?{nl}Are you sad?
Do you hate... me?
Just wait a little bit more.{nl}Soon... That person will awake.
The pain and sorrow... Despair...{nl}All those will subside within that person.
Please help me...{nl}Revelator, please... Please stop Giltine.
(A voice calling out for me can be heard.)
A method to purify the earth...{nl}I believe that the clerics might know more about this topic.
I know a method to purify the demons.{nl}
You need to hold your breath, so that no one will sense you.{nl}Then, quietly get closer to the lights...{nl}
Darn. A method to purify the earth, but not the demons?{nl}You should've found Druid Master if that's the case. The order is wrong.
You need my power?{nl}The price is bit steep. Is it a job worth that much?{nl}
Hold on... A method to purify the earth?{nl}Hey... I'm just a mercenary. Go find the answers somewhere else.
You came to the wrong place if you're looking for a method to purify the earth.{nl}No matter how you look at it, wouldn't that Druid Master have the answers?
The ferret plays dead in critical situations.
The ferret doesn't seem to like fruits that much.
The ferret became stronger by touching the totem.{nl}Ferrets! Win against humans!
The fruit has become bigger!{nl} Run away coward humans!{nl}
No human qualifications!{nl} Ferrets will scare them away!
Demons will help the ferrets.{nl}Make us stronger!{nl}
Demons said to protect.{nl}Humans! Cannot come closer!{nl}
Then demons. Continue to help the ferrets!
The mysterious girl has run off to Zeraha without a word. Let's follow her. 
The girl appeared and asked me to follow her.
Did you save everyone?
Looking for relics.
Found relics.

They say the Holy Relic was made to protect the revelations. {nl} This is what you need to use to lure in and defeat Gesti.
Accessory Merchant Ronesa
I heard not that long ago that thanks to the Revelators the demons failed to interfere with the Mage Tower.{nl}If it were me I would have made sure no one would have even dared to think about it in the first place.{nl}
So that what happened to my family won't happen ever again.

I knew we could thwart the demons with the power of the goddesses.{nl}But, I never would have guessed Giltine to use the Divine Tree...{nl}
What a nasty curse. {nl}Let's see which is stronger. Naktis' curse or the goddess' purifier.
Of course I have the purifier. {nl}But I'm not giving it to you unless you offer me money.
That's a shame.
The goddesses left several things in the hands of the first Paladin.{nl}The threat of Demon Queen Gesti, a mission of high-priority.{nl}
It was also mentioned that a savior would come.{nl}
But it's remarkable, the Statue of Goddess Ausrine in Klaipeda that is.{nl}She is able to take you anywhere you want despite not being Goddess Vakarine.
If you would ask me what a Bokor is, I will describe it as the following:{nl}A middleman standing between life and death.
Market Manager Logi
Death drifts further away from me every time a statue of the Spirit-Leading Owl is raised.{nl}Even in my old and tired body, if I can help our world with the power of the goddesses,{nl}that is what I must keep doing...
Does eternal life interest you?{nl}We, Necromancers, think the opposite. We deal with those whose hearts no longer beat.{nl}
Market Manager Molun
Thank you for saving us from such a daunting ordeal.{nl}Take some of my power as well.
I trust you won't just take our power and run away with it?{nl}We are only sharing it with you because it's what the Owl Chief commanded.
It hasn't been long since I came back to my senses, I'm afraid this is all the power I have...{nl}I hope you will find it useful.
Jurus, forgive me for not fulfilling your orders.{nl}We've lost the Delmore Castle.{nl}What we have there is an unbelievably horrifying sight.{nl}The demons... They have begun to hunt down the people.{nl}
I fled, but I don't think I will reach Orsha.{nl}If someone finds this letter, please take it to Jurus in Orsha...{nl}Please, uphold the family. Eras.
First of all, magic must be strong.{nl}Using powerful spells to unleash powerful magic is basic.{nl}What can you do with weak magic, right?
To become a strong mage, you cannot idle around and ignore practice.{nl}Well, you might be able to catch up to talented people such as myself.
It's very important to maintain a relaxed mind when using magic.{nl}Not only can you not be able to use magic when losing your composure, {nl}you might also find yourself in danger.{nl}
Those who use magic should keep their heads and hearts calm at all times.
Delicate control is required for higher ranked magic.{nl}A minor mistake may lead to a fatal result.{nl}
You must not forget this as you get more skillful and handle more variety of magic.
An advice from me?{nl}Speaking as a Linker, you must have a wide perspective and an open mind.{nl}
There are many cases of those mages who uses magic.{nl}Without checking their surroundings as they want to cast magic as soon as possible.{nl}
Not only do you have to watch for yourself and your enemies, {nl}but you must as well have to be in the head of your ally in arms.
If you don't plan the effects of your magic ahead, {nl}you are no different than those reckless novice soldiers swinging their swords around carelessly.
...After so many great accidents and tremendous feats, Zerai finally found people with{nl}whom he could study the supernatural powers that had manifested in himself.{nl}Eventually they came to contact with the magician group known as the Mage Society.{nl}
The Mage Society discovered that Zerai's powers were not exclusive,{nl}and could be learned by anyone regardless of their condition.{nl}Very much like magic itself.{nl}
That is how Zerai became an official member and the first Psychokino Master {nl}ever to be recognized by the Mage Society.{nl}Of course, at the time, it is said he himself did not know he would become the founder {nl}of a new branch of magic.
...As such, when a Psychokino's magic manifests itself, the results are identical,{nl} but there are in fact two ways this can happen.{nl}The first way is when one materializes supernatural powers in the form of regular spells.{nl}
The other way is a very particular case, like the one that originated this very branch of magic. {nl}It happens only to a few gifted people whose supernatural powers manifest naturally.{nl}
Zerai might have been the first master of these gifted magicians, {nl}but it is a known fact that even those who are born without such powers {nl}can achieve the same results through regular magical training.
...With the world falling into calamity, Ili Terid, a master proudly carrying the achievements {nl}of previous Psychokinos, believed that recording our pre-Medzio Diena history{nl}was a very important task and decided to take the pen in his own hands.{nl}
Helping those who are born with these powerful abilities avoid hurting their family and neighbors when they manifest and guiding them through the path of magic has been the most important work the masters have been performing ever since the beginning.{nl}
Had this seemingly simple task not been correctly carried out, disaster would have struck from little villages until Medzio Diena.
...People can develop psychological problems from focusing on the same thing for too long; this happens not just with magic but with general things as well.{nl}Especially for the magicians in the Mage Tower... For those who only wish to compete against other magicians, always focusing on their predecessors' achievements, there is a more of a chance this could happen.{nl}
So who should be in charge of controlling and preventing these issues for other magicians?{nl}Without us Psychokinos to watch over them, another magician could easily slip into madness, and should he or she be powerful enough, there is no knowing what things they could be capable of in the Mage Tower or out in the world.{nl}Antares is one such powerful magician...{nl}
(The book shelf is broken.)
I believe the role of Psychokinos has become even more important now that world has fallen into catastrophe.{nl}We must watch over the clerics who are now lost without the goddesses, we must control and defeat the monsters that roam our world and take on all responsibilities.{nl}
Try as we might it's hard to tell whether the duties taken by the goddesses in the past can be eased up.{nl}
For example if you find the legendary fantastic library, helping the goddesses inside or, should they be absent even there, restoring and maintaining it could become an enourmous task...
Wizards are magicians who are the most devoted to fundamental magic.{nl}Isn't going back to the basics the best way to start exploring stronger types of magic?
Using strong spells to channel strong magic is standard,{nl}but don't depend on only one kind of magic.{nl}You must learn how to conjugate different branches of it.
The settlers who came to Orsha feel uneasy at the sight of the tree roots surrounding the walls.{nl}They want to burn them but are afraid that Orsha will burn down with them as well.
Our fiery magic is what sets Pyromancers apart from the others.{nl}But if you play with fire you can't control, you'll be nothing but a pyromaniac.
Turning bad situations around is what Cryomancers do.{nl}Our cold composure is the main source of our magical power.
Cryomancers must remain cold and prudent at all times.{nl}Conceit, carelessness, and indolence will be the end of you.
There are so many people in Orsha now, you can't tell who's a settler and who's a refugee.{nl}I wonder if it's not too much for our lord to handle...
Psychokinos' brand of magic is different compared to other types.{nl}Believe in yourself and have confidence with endless limits.{nl}These are the sources of the Psychokinos' magical power.
Even after Medzio Diena we've had our hands full with all sorts of problems.{nl}And we might just be facing the most important of them all.
All beings in this world are connected in some way.{nl}We can end all conflicts if we accept each other as one and the same.
Shapeshifting is a very profound type of magic, but simply learning it will not make you stronger.{nl}If you can't use it in battle, you're better off learning something else.
For Thaumaturges, it's the battle that matters.{nl}You need to control others' properties and shapes in a way that's favorable to you.
Orsha is also being plagued with all sorts of incidents, so nothing's been going as planned.{nl}What we really need now are strong and talented people who can help us.
Elementalists don't focus on a single property.{nl}We combine various different elemental properties in an efficient way.
The advantage of using a bow is that you can finish an opponent from afar.{nl}Of course that is meaningless if you can't aim, haha.
Archers are already invincible to any opponent out there, {nl}but there is one type that actually makes them stronger.{nl}I'm talking about the flying-type enemies with cloth armor.
If you run away when there's too many enemies, look somewhere else.{nl}I'm not into defeating only one enemy at a time.
Rangers' techniques are specialized in handling multiple opponents at once.{nl}If you're going to defend this many settlers, wouldn't these techniques be an advantage for you?
Shields, rocks, monsters, you need to use anything you can.{nl}There's no such thing as being shy in battle.
Of course flashy techniques are good too...{nl}When you're not hurt and in no danger to die, that is.
Using traps to affect many enemies at once is the specialty of Sappers.{nl}We use techniques adopted from military engineering.
I believe a Sapper always needs to be cautious.{nl}Any trap you set up can completely change the outcome of the battle.
Hunters aren't Hunters without their companions.{nl}Companions aren't just comrades in arms, they are trustworthy friends.
No one can escape a Hunter's sight.{nl}They can find and defeat even hidden enemies.
My twin sister, May Patt, is the Wugushi Submaster who's currently far away in Klaipeda.{nl}Orsha is bad enough, but I can't imagine how things are over there...
Since poison is Wugushis' specialty, people tend to avoid them out of fear.{nl}It's not like they use poison everywhere they go, so there's no real reason to worry.{nl}...Although, I suppose that doesn't change the fact that poison is actually dangerous.
I heard that people outside of Orsha are still escaping.{nl}They say there are even people who can't get into Orsha... The situation is really bad.
Scouts are experts in reconaissance and infiltrating enemy camps.{nl}We hide ourselves from our enemies and attack when they least expect it.
Empty Scroll
(Nothing is written on it.)
Scroll With Writings
Three years have passed since Medzio Diena and still no news of their life or death, much less their whereabouts.{nl}As we can no longer dwell on this task, the search for our allies lost during Medzio Diena and the royal family's objects will be temporarily suspended.{nl}Return to the assembly area as soon as you receive this command.{nl}-{nl}Yura Swanjone
Hmm?{nl}That scroll...{nl}
I know what this is.{nl}It's a secret document that you have to spray with a special solution to make the letters appear.{nl}
Huh, it's been a while.{nl}Us Scouts use this too sometimes.{nl}
I'm not sure I can make the solution that makes letters appear for you... {nl}But I can tell you how it's made.{nl}It's a bit complicated, but if you follow the instructions you should be good.
Who are you?{nl}If you don't tell me the truth about how you got that scroll all the way here...{nl}I'm afraid you'll have to say goodbye to this world.{nl}
Are you saying you can read the secret writings on the scroll AND came to find me?{nl}That's unexpected... Ah, I'm sorry for what I said earlier.{nl}
I gave that scroll to another Shinobi.{nl}One that is no longer among us... Having it end up here again really brings back memories.
But thank you, really.{nl}I cannot ask you to take this as my apology,{nl}but if you're curious about the path of the Shinobi you can always visit me.{nl}
I mean, I can find out for you anything you want to know about the Shinobi.{nl}Since I am one myself, I could teach you to become one.
All I can give you as my apology is the techniques of the Shinobi...{nl}But, that doesn't seem to suit you, so I can't even give you that.{nl}
I really appreciate it.{nl}Oh, and please don't tell anyone I'm here, alright?

Have you had the honor of meeting the Chaplain Master?{nl}I was so moved when he spoke to each one of us, lowly soldiers ever so kindly.
It has been said that he is present here gracing the soldiers of Orsha.{nl}I am not sure if he is still with them or not.
It was a few days ago.{nl}The Chaplain Master came here and asked us certain questions.{nl}
It seemed like he is helping in the efforts to penetrate the Gateway of the Great King...{nl}Also, he had some business with the Cleric Masters in Klaipeda.
We had the honor of meeting the Chaplain Master.{nl}I was so moved when he spoke to each one of us, lowly soldiers ever so kindly.
I think the he will be visiting the soldiers in the East Siauliai Woods...{nl}I am not sure if he is still there.{nl}{nl}
It was a few days ago.{nl}The Chaplain Master came here and asked us certain questions.{nl}Seemed to be helping in the efforts to penetrate the Gateway of the Great King.{nl}
I'm not exactly sure, but the he did say was he going to meet the Cleric Masters in Klaipeda.{nl}Perhaps, you might see him there?
You mean the Chaplain Master?{nl}He seemed to be busy with royal business.{nl}
The Master even asked to to supply Holy Water and deploy the clerics.{nl}The Master asked to be sent to the Commander Julian's Army. You can probably meet the Master there.
Chaplain Master
Oh, aren't you the Revelator whom everyone has been talking about?{nl}
Just as I expected. {nl}I have heard a lot from the Priest Master about you.{nl}
Even I could certainly tell how great a Priest you are.{nl}
I want someone like you to be a Chaplain.{nl}These words are not hollow lipservice so, please, consider it in the most serious way.{nl}
As you can, surely, see. We are trying to create a path to the Gateway of the Great King.{nl}Quite a reckless task... But if we do not establish the path, {nl}the exchange with Fedimian would diminish and get extinguished altogether soon.
Everyone is tired but none ever show it.{nl}I also am willing to help the troops the best I can.
Be careful, the terminal can only be handled at a particular time...{nl}The curse needs to be cleared out.

Orsha Bulletin Board
The blessed city of Orsha wishes glory to the goddesses!
Orsha Resident
Do you know about the legend that's been passed down in Orsha?{nl}Everyone in Orsha knows this story.{nl}
A long time ago there was a young shepherd who lived in Orsha.{nl}One day he went out to the outskirts of the city with his sheep and there he met a girl.{nl}
After that, the shepherd and the girl would often meet and play together.{nl}They say the girl didn't talk much and could only string together a few simple words.{nl}
Then... something strange happened.{nl}Everything the girl had told the shepherd, big and small things, eventually happened.{nl}
The shepherd thought it was marvelous, so he told his uncle Bloele about the girl.{nl}Bloele was a highly respected priest in Orsha.{nl}
Bloele listened to his nephew's story and figured he shouldn't ignore it.{nl}The next day he went out to meet the girl with his nephew.{nl}
Bloele treated the girl as if he were meeting one of the goddesses.{nl}When she saw him, without saying a word, the girl drew something on the ground.{nl}
Bloele stepped on the girl's magical drawing and {nl}immediately he saw something slowly appearing in his mind.{nl}Three important events... Bloele was a priest so he knew how important they were.{nl}
Medzio Diena... Orsha's disaster...{nl}And another one he only told the bishops in Orsha.{nl}
After that the girl was never seen again and the shepherd went on to become a brilliant cleric.{nl}Now, Medzio Diena and the destruction of Orsha already happened, {nl}so what could be the other event?
Girl Settler
I can't help but to worry every time I look at the statue of the goddess.{nl}Everything is so uncertain without the goddesses... What will happen to us?
Our kingdom has five great goddesses, as you probably know.{nl}There are also many other goddesses that help them.{nl}
But now we don't know where any of them are.
The one you see in front of you is the Statue of Goddess Ausrine.{nl}She is in charge of the dawn and is the one who leads all the other goddesses.{nl}
Also, you've probably heard people say someone "returns to the goddess" when they pass away.{nl}By that, they mean Goddess Ausrine.
Goddess Gabija is in charge of fire.{nl}People who mainly deal with housework often pray to her.{nl}
They do it so their houses will be warm as well as their food.{nl}As for magicians... Well, shouldn't they have to pray even more?
Goddess Zemyna is the goddess of earth.{nl}She is in charge of lands and crops.{nl}
My family farms for a living so we always pray to Goddess Zemyna.{nl}It's very hard to grow good potatoes without her blessing.
However, after Medzio Diena we've had plants growing everywhere.{nl}I wonder how Goddess Zemyna feels about that.
Goddess Vakarine is in charge of the night stars.{nl}She is also the one who wakes up Goddess Ausrine for the following day.{nl}Her symbol is the red star that shines in the night sky.{nl}
Vakarine is also the goddess of vitality and repose,{nl}and can be considered a guardian of travelers like yourself.{nl}If your feet hurt, just say the name Goddess Vakarine three times, it will help.
Goddess Laima... Hmm... I'm not sure.{nl}I'm sure the priests will know...{nl}
She's said to be the goddess of fate and foresight, but she hasn't really showed herself.{nl}I wonder, could Goddess Laima have been aware of all these catastrophes?
Young Settler
To think I barely made it into Orsha...{nl}I thought it would be safe here, but it's just like Medzio Diena!
I heard about Orsha before coming here.{nl}They said the fortress walls had been covered with tree roots during Medzio Diena.{nl}
But Medzio Diena ended four years ago now.{nl}
Didn't they tell us to come here because it was safe?{nl}I really don't know what to think of this...
On Medzio Diena everything was chaos.{nl}These are all things I heard but... {nl}They say that a terrible catastrophe happened on a night four years ago.{nl}
Apparently it was worse in the capital.{nl}They say a gigantic tree bursted up from somewhere deep in the ground there.{nl}
The capital was completely destroyed.{nl}The survivors say that the grounds and the skies all collapsed.{nl}
And that's not all, just look at Orsha. Do you see the walls all covered in roots?{nl}Fedimian too is completely taken over except for the Holy District.{nl}
The aftermath of Medzio Diena reached all the way to the small villages.{nl}The trees and plants suddenly grew bigger, turning into monsters...{nl}
And where do you think those monsters went?{nl}They invaded the villages and left them devastated.{nl}
This was four years ago but everything stays the same.{nl}What on earth could the missing goddesses be doing...?
We can just keep growing more bracken, we have someone to do that!{nl}No one can stop miss Giltine's plan.
(There's traces of something having been dragged here.)
(There's only demon footprints left all over, nothing else.)
(There doesn't seem to be any blood stains here.)
Traveling Merchant Rose
It must have been completely exhausted.{nl}It was Laswi who protected us from the demons.
It must have been completely exhausted.{nl}It was Laswi who protected us from the demons.
Traveling Merchant Ramille
Laswi! Is Rose okay?{nl}I should go back now.
Experiment Victim Tilis
I don't want to return to the goddess!{nl}Please help me...
Do you have a stamina recovery potion?
It was a black liquid.{nl}Just bring me anything. I'll put it in the device and check.
The device inside the main building's atrium seems to{nl}be the protective shield device Edmundas mentioned.
Suddenly, I realized.{nl}In the beginning I almost gave my life away a few times for insignificant things...{nl}Yes... I realized that.
Everything has a meaning.{nl}The essence is in the soul.{nl}
I decided to set up more traps to keep everyone from knowing about this horrible truth.{nl}I can't destroy them. I can't do it...{nl}
You too can't escape from here.{nl}If you're looking at this tombstone, doesn't that mean you saw it too?{nl}
Now something really horrible is about to happen.
Dadan Jungle Experiment Journal, Page 1
Kruvina already proved its power at Bellai Rainforest.{nl}But nowhere connects to the Pelke Shrine Ruins here in Dadan Jungle.{nl}I need to use the device...
Dadan Jungle Experiment Journal, Page 2
My giant bracken plan is running smoothly.{nl}I just need someone who is qualified to control it.{nl}I also need a lot more aconite and plant materials to breed the spores.{nl}I will move the distillery to Dadan Jungle in order to extract the components needed.
Dadan Jungle Experiment Journal, Page 4
The Monastery's experiment subjects weren't enough.{nl}I need a little more experiment results.{nl}
Propagation, persistency, lethality, weather resistance, etc.{nl}I need to collect as much data as possible.{nl}I think I might get enough experiment subjects from a village nearby.
Dadan Jungle Experiment Journal, Page 3
I need to think of a way to avoid overheating in the device's source of energy.{nl}I think a cooling spell could prevent overheating {nl}and protect the source of energy at the same time.
Welcome!{nl}Sockets, repairs, recipes... you can leave that all to me.
We can't accept too many new requests since supplies became scarce after the migration order.{nl}I'm just as skilled as my father though, so don't be afraid to ask me for anything!
I sure have my hands full with the reconstruction of Orsha and the migration order.{nl}But when it comes to equipment you can bet I have the best!
I'm only a shop assistant so I can't give you a discount.{nl}I'll talk to the owner. Meanwhile, feel free to look around!
Item Merchant Alf
After the migration order I made more friends, {nl}but my father is having a hard time obtaining items.{nl}We still sell the best ones though, so look around!
My father was hurt during Medzio Diena, so I'm helping him look after the shop.{nl}Feel free to look around!
I can no longer trade with Fedimian because of the monsters, but I still have some stock left.{nl}Feel free to come anytime; I'm working hard, too.
It may be a little chaotic now, but Orsha is a nice place.{nl}So, what can I get for you?
For those long, lonely journeys, there's no better reliable fellow than a companion.{nl}They're obedient, always with you... and most of all they're adorable.
These buddies can really help you in exciting and nerve-wrecking battles.{nl}You can make them wait while you fight and you can train them, too.{nl}
Oh, I almost forgot! Not every class can ride on all the companions I sell.{nl}You see, these buddies have preferences just like us.{nl}They might not be able to talk, but they have feelings just like everyone else.
Market Manager Tilliana
Over here! Over here! Come take a look.{nl}Don't forget to retrieve your purchased items.

H-hi.{nl}If you ever run out of inventory space, you can use our storage instead.{nl}I... I mean, we! We'll make sure that your items are safe and sound!
Florianna
Pleased to meet you. I am from the Magic Association of Orsha.{nl}We are collecting objects that when combined, react in mysterious ways.{nl}If you could cooperate with us, we would deeply appreciate it.
Rosia
The Wings of Vaivora is collecting all information that exists in this world.{nl}Why don't you tell me a lovely life story of yours and we'll add it to our records.
Leticia
The atmosphere here is... very different from where I used to live.{nl}Oh, I don't mind if you don't purchase anything. Don't worry, take your time to look around.
I'm selling very special items you won't see anywhere else.{nl}Where do I get them, you ask? That's a secret.
Did you say you found a place that looks like a demon base?
I think a demon base could have documents about the giant bracken.
How did it go? Was the cauldron destroyed?
So the protective magic circle around the cauldron has been lifted, right? {nl}You should go now and destroy the cauldron before the demons {nl}find out about the missing magic circle.
Just wait for a while... I'm going to focus.
The Great Pirate and Hirevan Vol. 2
The Great Pirate Vladslovas.{nl}With every step, his footprints would slosh with the blood of his defeated enemies.{nl}He made demons bow their heads and step back.{nl}No being was more vicious or brutal than him.{nl}
In front of the ruthless Vladslovas,{nl}stood a much younger Hirevan.{nl}From the splashing waves, to the rocking boats...{nl}
Even the seagulls soaring up high had quieten down to watch them.{nl}There was no prize for the winner of this battle.{nl}It was simply a question of maintaining or being robbed of the title of Great Pirate.{nl}
Hirevan drew his cutlass first,{nl}and began to attack Vladslovas in swift moves,{nl}aiming once for the chest, twice for each side of the torso.{nl}
But his attacks were too obvious to Vladslovas.{nl}So, upon getting a hold of Hirevan's cutlass,{nl}he kicked him in the pit of his stomach, knocking him over.{nl}
Then, as if teaching the younger pirate a lesson,{nl}he violently hit Hirevan with the grip of his sword.{nl}Hirevan barely managed to escape and got back on his feet.{nl}But he was already injured and Vladslovas looked set for victory.
My brother said that the problems started when the light started to shine after the demons went inside the Apega Protocol Room.
I'll be with my brother.
Here it is!{nl}The mucus of a Hummingbird.
Did Dejamis intruct you on how to create the Protection Barrier Crystal?{nl}Now, we can finally feel safe again!{nl}

(Rose will be in danger if she's all alone. Let's look for her in Knidos Jungle.)

Pilgrim Agatas' Journal
I could not help but be surprised when I discovered the Soul Fragments were those of Hauberk.{nl}Hauberk, the Demon Lord of Brutality who is notorious for cruelty...{nl}
The same Hauberk who, {nl}slaughtered so many people and made a gruesome sight of the Kupoles of Goddess Vakarine who were following them.{nl}The Soul Fragment of that Hauberk is in my hands...{nl}
But the Soul Fragment of Hauberk in front of me has long lost the essence of what it used to be,{nl}asking for help running from the demons chasing it in return for granting a wish.
I remember seeing it somewhere. {nl}About how Hauberk's essence was split amongst the Soul Fragments when Hauberk's soul was ripped apart by demons.{nl}One fragment contains what conscience that was left, another contains his memories and knowledge,{nl}yet another has his boldness, and yet another his essence of brutality...{nl}
I will agree to his contract because I have something I wish to accomplish.{nl}But his essence... Where is the Soul Fragment containing his brutality?{nl}Noone could possibly imagine the atrocities that will occur if that fragment ever surfaces.
Hauberk, Demon Lord of Brutality
Year 624, records of Archivist Dartas Jonas.{nl}-{nl}Even amongst the many demons, Demon Lord Hauberk especially enjoyed slaughtering and manipulating humans to create his legion.{nl}There is no record of such atrocities being committed, even by demons, in any of the kingdom's libraries.{nl}
Goddess Vakarine sent the Kupoles as she could no longer bear to watch his villainy,{nl}but even the Kupoles sustained heavy losses as they fell victim to Hauberk's ruses.
Oh, hello there. Welcome.{nl}We collect various requests and present them to adventurers like you.{nl}
You can receive requests over there from receptionists Ramda, Liam or Donnes.{nl}Please remember that they all deal with different requests.
Oh, you're the inquisitive type aren't you? Unfortunately, that information is classified.{nl}Otherwise, our clients wouldn't have any faith in me when requesting jobs.{nl}
Well... Everyone has their own reasons.{nl}I am sure you will understand this since the pay is good.
This is the catastrophe that has already arisen...{nl}The seeds of a greater calamity have already been planted.{nl}
I wonder... Where could the goddess of fate be?{nl}Where could all the other goddesses be...?{nl}
See?{nl}Not a single goddess can protect you from the death that is me.{nl}
And so I hereby ask you, Revelator...{nl}Why don't you just close your eyes and ears...
And run away like every other human did.
Swordsmen are all about pure STR.{nl}
However, you can also build up your DEX and CON.{nl}You'll need to think very careful about what path you will take.
Wizards need INT.{nl}
However, you shouldn't forget SPR if you want to cast more spells.{nl}You'll have to choose between being balanced or specialized.
Archers are all about STR.{nl}
However, DEX will prevent problems with movements.{nl}Think careful about what path you will take.
Clerics need INT, but they might need a lot of STR or SPR as well.{nl}
It is up to you what path you will take in this adventure.
Bishop Urbonas
If the orders from the Demon Orders are achieved, Orsha will no longer be safe.{nl}I hope our lord will make her decisions wisely.{nl}The situation right now is disastrous enough as it is with the migration order.{nl}
The choice is yours.{nl}I am sure the goddesses want you to lead our salvation too.
O Revelator, the one who saved Orsha. What can I do for you?
(The writing is hard to make out since it's smudged from the rain.)
(There are traces of a fire having been hastily put out.)
(These are the objects of the priests... It seems like they took only a few important things and left.)
The events of the Ashaq Underground Prison were only the beginning.{nl}How much more will we have to sacrifice...
All I can trust is the map left by the bishop and you...{nl}Please be careful.
Too many people have been asking to speak to our lord in person.{nl}She's outside the walls now trying to answer to them.
Even small things will become strong when they unite.
(It reeks.)
I think this is what the writings on the platform said.{nl}
Remember the sacred numbers with your own two eyes.{nl}The candle light will chase away the evil darkness...{nl}
We've started to clear out some monsters and open the seal.{nl}The treasure hidden in the Legwyn family mansion...{nl}We will find it no matter what.
Basic skills are the most important and serious of all.{nl}These basics are extremely practical in a Swordsman's career.
Worthy talented people are gathering in Orsha as well.{nl}But something big is about to happen, I can tell it is.
More and more settlers are now gathering in Orsha.{nl}I think if there's anyone who can protect them all, it's the Peltasta.
Swords and shields aren't equipment that just protect you.{nl}The shields of the Peltasta have the power to protect the entire kingdom.
Medzio Diena, the missing goddesses... and now this monster invasion...{nl}As Clerics, we need to share the divine grace of the goddesses now more than ever.
For the Clerics, our mission is to help people through healing.{nl}If only we could heal wounded hearts, too...
I learned that a true Krivis must lower itself and be devoted to the goddesses.{nl}An unshakable faith can overcome even the worst catastrophe.
Faith is both a Krivis' power and mission.{nl}It's a shame how people seem to be forgetting the goddesses after all these catastrophes.{nl}
Until the day all wrongful things disappear from this land...{nl}Our role as Priests is to deliver justice in the name of the goddesses.
Priests purge the world of evil energy by the grace of the goddesses.{nl}Our powers are proof that the goddesses still exist.
So, you want my blessing to become a Priest?{nl}Of course, it'll be my pleasure to bless you.
May your path be blessed by the goddesses.
Spears are a good beginner's weapon, but the learning curve is steep.{nl}Once you master the techniques, enemies will be no match for your spear.
More and more people are coming to Orsha in search of a safe place.{nl}I wonder what they think when they see Orsha like this...
A broker standing between life and death...{nl}That's how the Bokor Master from Klaipeda described the Bokor.
A sword in your left hand, a shield in your right hand. {nl}It feels weaker than carrying a two-handed sword, right?{nl}That's if you don't know about the Rodeleros. {nl}What's in your right hand is just as much of a weapon.
You're not seeing things clearly if you think a shield is the only way to protect you from attacks.{nl}A shield can be a weapon just as good as a sword.
Mobility is the best means for a Cataphract to attack.{nl}You use your speed to strike your opponents with your spear.
The settlers who moved to Orsha are mostly people {nl}who lost their hometowns due to monster attacks.{nl}But who knows... if another disaster like Medzio Diena won't happen again.
Don't be scared. I just want to help Orsha so I sent out my spirit.{nl}You can do that if you're a high-ranked Sadhu.
We Paladins are always on the frontline in battles against the demons.{nl}Even if your mind is in the right place, if your confidence falters,{nl}your faith will be nothing but unfortunate.
Paladins are fearless because we believe the goddesses will always protect us.{nl}Fear comes from a lack of faith, you see.
Now it's time to test out the techniques you've learned so far.{nl}Go and defeat the monsters in Apsimesti Crossroads.
They say everything works out if you just devote yourself, right?{nl}Orsha and Fedimian are a bit far away but... please think of it as devotion.
Ardel's Diary, Page 1
Date: XX/XX. A clear sky.{nl}-{nl}Things at Delmore Castle are busy as always.{nl}The walls destroyed during Medzio Diena are being rebuilt and everyone is returning to their normal lives.{nl}I hope nothing like Medzio Diena happens ever again.{nl}Thanks to Lord Delmore I think the castle will be safe now.
Ardel's Diary, Page 2
Date: XX/XX. Cloudy.{nl}-{nl}They've been raising pillars in some places inside the fortress.{nl}Lord Delmore said that Orsha was occupied by monsters and demons and so he is raising them to prevent that.{nl}As expected of a truly talented alchemist...{nl}The people of Delmore Hamlet are joining in too.
Ardel's Diary, Page 3
Date: XX/XX. A clear sky.{nl}-{nl}The demons attacked us by surprise.{nl}Lord Delmore commanded every single resident of the fortress to move to the manor.{nl}I'll probably be safe if I go there too.
If you hunt Charcoal Walkers, some of them have arrows in their bodies that you can still use...
Revelator Yane
Wait, how did this happen?{nl}I thought you said the magic supply device had been destroyed!{nl}
Isn't the protective shield around the Kruvina device still intact?
That's impossible... I was sure it would disappear...{nl}
Wait a second!{nl}This can only mean Delmore Rephaim changed the device's layout after I left!
Could it be?{nl}So you too were a pawn of that Lord Delmore...{nl}
What you know is useless and now I'm not even sure I believe you.{nl}We need to find a way to stop this ourselves.
Yane. Wait.{nl}Wouldn't it be better to help Melchioras first and then find a new way to solve this?
You will help Melchioras then.{nl}As far as I can tell it's time for us to act separately.
Alright everybody, let's go.{nl}We need to find a way to destroy the Kruvina device together.
I was so oblivious.{nl}To think that Delmore Rephaim had anything to do with it...
I know what Yane is like.{nl}In a situation like this she's definitely going to try and destroy the device by force.{nl}
I don't think our words can convince her.{nl}Melchioras, we need to find another way before Yane puts herself out there.
Oh... you're that new Revelator from earlier.{nl}You're helping out Mihail and Melchioras, are you?{nl}
That's good.{nl}The information you found is important, you should let them know, too.{nl}
Looking through a suspicious area we found a secret document hidden by Lord Delmore.{nl}We also found a way to destroy the Kruvina device.{nl}
We're all set here...{nl}Go and tell Mihail to come meet us by the device at the Palma Plaza.{nl}
We're going to join forces and strike at once.{nl}You join in too, if you can.
Stop!{nl}Everybody, step away from the device!
Welcome, Mihail.{nl}Now let's hurry and destroy this vicious device.
I know, just get away from the device, quick!{nl}Yane! Hey!
Delmore Rephaim
What a nice gesture to see you all gathered around here.{nl}Now, give everything to me!
Give me more life... More power!
No!!{nl}How could this happen...{nl}
I'll take down the magic of the device even if I have to give my whole power and life for it!{nl}Please save me!
Ah... are you Melchioras, the traitor?{nl}I have to thank you.{nl}
You and Revelator Yane there as well...{nl}You have no idea how fun it was to watch you from above...
What are you doing, Melchioras!!{nl}Go hide in a corner somewhere like the coward you are!!{nl}
Alright... Let's see just how bravely you can destroy it.{nl}I'll give you a taste of how the Kruvina is really used!
Is everyone alright?
What have I done...{nl}It was all my fault... I was so careless...
Melchioras is in danger.{nl}I'll save him!
Yane! Wait!
We should go after her.{nl}Those who are injured should stay here and take care of the other demons.
Follower Bigs
If only we were more powerful we could have helped the Revelators...{nl}All we can do is feel sorry about our limitations.
There was even talks of kidnapping a wizard and running away...{nl}Definitely not ordinary people.
Thank you. With someone capable like you, there should be no problems.
There's no telling how far the demons' evil deeds will go.{nl}Just look at how they built that device.
Thank you.{nl}To collect it the ground needs to stay still or it won't have any effect, so be careful.
Conner and I will take the path on the right.{nl}You and Mihail look through the path that goes up.{nl}Monsters here are especially fierce so be careful.{nl}{nl}Conner and I will head towards the Tagica Crossroads.{nl}You and Mihail can head to the Assembly Hall.{nl}{nl}
To have an enchantment prepared in such a short time is definitely extraordinary.{nl}So, enchantment and demons... I think I got it.{nl}
The core of it is magic.{nl}To keep an enchantment this strong it takes a lot of magical power.{nl}
The demons' stamina may be lower, but the magic core could still make an appearance.{nl}Let's attack that or just defeat all the demons!
As expected... the enchantment is a lot trouble to deal with.
I saw a device on my way here...{nl}Maybe that's the main core of the enchantment. Let's go back.{nl}
The doll is glowing just like Yane said.{nl}Please take it to her.
It won't move.{nl}It's completely stuck to the spot.
I think I can break it down with a bomb.{nl}Two minutes should be enough. Please hold back the demons.
Success!{nl}
The explosion is sure to make demons come running here.{nl}I'll try and stop them as much as I can; you take care of Delmore Rephaim.
You're here...{nl}
You must think I lost now that you found me.{nl}But I won't lose that easily.{nl}
It's true... I don't think I can become a god.{nl}But I can turn myself into something more noble.{nl}
All my possessions, my people, my knowledge, they're still not enough!{nl}Revelators... Their power alone will guide me.{nl}
Surprised?{nl}This Kruvina is the first piece made with all my loyal vassals.{nl}
Consider it an honor to be its first victim.{nl}Don't worry, I'll make sure to turn all the other Revelators into Kruvina so you won't feel lonely!
Of course monsters are a threat, but not as much as the demons.{nl}If we keep exterminating them this place will soon be free of the demons.
The box is empty.

Mysterious Bulletin Board
311st day of the War{nl}-{nl}Unbelievable news.{nl}Legendary marksman Lydia Schaffen has sided with the Royal Army.{nl}Although I tried to calm my subordinates by asking whether she was better than our Commander Ruklys, but once the anxiety and nervousness spreads, there's nothing we can truly do about it.{nl}
331st day of the War{nl}-{nl}No matter how this war ends, if given the chance, I want to kill the chancellor.{nl}If we emerge victorious, I will ask Ruklys to have me execute him, and if we fail, I will at least want to charge at his barricade and stab his chest with a blade; even if I die in the process.{nl}Eminent has started to take over the Earth Tower while leading the demons.{nl}As a human being, how dare he join forces with the demons...?
If you adore the goddess so much, then allow me send you back to Her!
The Story of Karolis Vol. 1
The Springs of Karolis hide the story of a not so well-known hero.{nl}-{nl}Karolis... He was the favorite disciple of Tesla, the most famous of the Dievdirbys.{nl}Commanded by Goddess Ausrine, Tesla had carved several statues of the Spirit-Leading Owl.{nl}
He placed each statue in a different spot deep within the dark forest.{nl}This was to guide the spirits on their way to Goddess Ausrine.{nl}He also made a friend to protect the owls - Sequoia.{nl}
The Story of Karolis Vol. 3
Karolis looked at the girl and said,{nl}"I will give you my life, if you give me the power to protect you."{nl}With a sad look on her face, the girl shook her head, but Karolis would not give up.{nl}
And so, with a reluctant nod of the girl's head, Karolis' body began to glow as it turned into a tree.{nl}The light radiating from him turned all the demons in the forest to ashes and drove away all evil energy within it.{nl}
The girl left in tears, and the forest once charged with evil forces was now filled with divine energy.{nl}Karolis' traces can be found to this day.{nl}Letas' holy trees are descendants of the tree Karolis was turned into.{nl}
To this day, Karolis protects the forest.{nl}He was never able to become the great Dievdirbys he had dreamed of, but his sacrifice lives on.{nl}
Demon Class Notes
Today's class notes... I'm so sleepy. I want my bed...{nl}-{nl}Since the beginning of human history, the goddesses have exercised their benign power on people.{nl}Demons, then, are the evil forces opposed to that power.{nl}They use their own power to hurt humans and work against the goddesses.{nl}
Evil itself has no substance.{nl}Knives, for example, can be used both to hurt people and prepare food.{nl}But demons are absolute evil.{nl}Demons cannot be eternal, and they are not accepted by the goddesses.
The Mystery of Bracken Forest
Koru Jungle, Knidos Jungle and Dadan Jungle are all known for their herbs, but particularly for their bracken.{nl}The night dew gathers in their small, closely arranged leaves, creating a fantastic sight when the first rays of light shine on them every morning.{nl}
Watching the bracken spores float around when the season comes makes one wonder if such a sight isn't too a blessing of the goddesses.
King Kadumel's Prison
The Ashaq Underground Prison is the only remaining prison out of several built in the south part of King Kadumel's kingdom.{nl}Despite its connection to Ruklys Civil War and King Kadumel's tyranny, the building remains to this day as it was maintained through the years for various purposes other than a prison.{nl}
Curiously, despite this, the building's structure and interior have maintained the same atmoshpere of the original prison.
Orsha, City of Commerce
Orsha, the city of commerce. Great as it was, it did not survive Medzio Diena unscathed.{nl}Large tree roots spread throughout Orsha, demolishing the city's mighty walls and causing an earthquake of tremendous magnitude.{nl}The disaster killed the lord of Orsha and all his successors, merely sparing his only daughter, who is currently in charge of the city.
Zeraha's Goddess Statue
Unlike the other goddesses, Laima, the goddess of fate and foresight, exists only in records.{nl}Goddess Laima's encounters with humans are scarce and so are her known blessings, making her a lesser known deity despite being one of the main goddesses.{nl}
Despite this, the statue of Goddess Laima in Zeraha is universally admired for its tremendous size and beauty.{nl}Some believe that in ancient times there could have existed a hidden city, while others say the city was built in a single day by the power of the goddess.{nl}
Whatever the truth, it is believed that the people who built the statue are no longer among us, their few descendants having created a village where they currently live.
The Correct Classification of Demons and Monsters
There is no exact way to classify demons and monsters based on external appearance.{nl}Those familiar with monsters can often distinguish them from demons, however this knowledge comes merely from experience and not from the application of general principles.{nl}
There is one fundamental internal difference between demons and regular monsters.{nl}Demons possess a mind capable of producing thoughts, among which is their clear malevolence towards humans.
The Alchemist's Oath
The Alchemist's Oath originated in the Winterspoon family, known as the founders of alchemy.{nl}Their principles were passed down and, over time, they became established as the alchemists' official rules.{nl}
{nl}One. Alchemists must not defy the will of the goddesses through their research or its results.{nl}-{nl}Two. Alchemists may not harm what is good or the goddesses through their research or its results.{nl}-{nl}Three. Alchemists may not use the goddesses or fellow humans as materials.{nl}
All alchemists vow to protect others by obeying these principles.
Old Diary
Ours was a peaceful kingdom. There was nothing we lacked and people were happy.{nl}Every year we celebrated the spring festival and the goddesses answered our prayers.{nl}But eventually, more and more of our prayers started being left unanswered.{nl}Was it an omen? Suddenly, in the center of the capital an enormous tree sprouted up from the ground and started to spread out.{nl}
Within moments, the capital was destroyed beyond recognition and many had to face the loss of loved ones.{nl}After the initial shock, people started to run, trying to escape the source of the disaster.{nl}But it was far from over.{nl}
The colossal tree spread out its fully-bloomed flowers and started to engulf those trying to escape.{nl}Soon the capital had completely collapsed. The tremendous aftermath extended the disaster to many other cities.{nl}
Four years have passed since the nightmare.{nl}The wounds have hardly begun to heal. The goddesses remain unheard of.{nl}Monsters continue to terrorize our world and the affected cities are yet to be reconstructed.{nl}We still struggle with the lack of supplies, but we're trying to return to our normal lives as best as we can.{nl}
In Klaipeda, some people have started to recount dreams of the goddesses.{nl}If only that were a sign that the goddesses are returning.{nl}If... if they come back, can we finally wake up from this nightmare?
Letter for an Unknown Receiver
...{nl}These spores grow out from the body of the host by feeding off the host's energy of after laying dormant for a while. Spores that have fully grown to ferns immediately prepare to multiply by emitting the same spores.{nl}The enlargement of the ferns is going smoothly as well.{nl}The ferns can be made to emit more spores in a larger radius at any time.{nl}
I am thinking of regulating through controlling a qualifier.{nl}There is no trouble in the maintaining a steady supply of subjects and finding qualifiers. {nl}I prompted the monsters into positions where they will attack towns.{nl}As planned, the Lord of Orsha has issued migration orders, and will not notice if a few towns disappear.{nl}
Leave it to me.{nl}At this rate, we will be able to sacrifice not only Orsha, but the entire kingdom as nourishment for the Divine Tree.{nl}{nl}
Lord Delmore Rephaim. {nl}Begin preparations for the next plan at once.{nl}Survival of the vessel planned to protect the Reservoir Kruvina has been confirmed.{nl}The ferns are growing at a steady pace and we will soon be able to capture the targeted qualifier.{nl}
The demons have not caught on yet. {nl}If everything goes to plan, it will be possible to steal the divine power as a new ingredient.
Officer's Diary, Part I
The lord issued new construction orders even as the restoration work after Medzio Diena was being conducted.{nl}He said that it was to create a large barrier to ward off monsters.{nl}As ordered, I divided sections with the new mages and deployed soldiers accordingly.{nl}
The work on restoration and the barrier is going smoothly.{nl}There was a bit of trouble with public order, but was sorted soon enough.{nl}
The Lord of Orsha sent Migration Recommendations.{nl}I am sure that our lord will not respond to such nonsense.{nl}Abandoning your hometown is such a ridiculous thought.{nl}I also doubt that Orsha has the capacity to receive all the new refugees.{nl}
The lord advanced the deadline for the barrier saying that protecting the people from monsters is more important than the restoration projects.{nl}Workforce from the restoration project will be reassigned to the construction of the barrier.
Officer's Diary, Part II
The barrier was completed thanks to the cooperation of the mages.{nl}We will be safe from all monster threats as soon as the lord finishes the last stage on the barrier.{nl}I had heard rumors that our lord is an alchemist that is recognized by even the Winterspoon family. They must not have been exaggerations after all.{nl}
I received reports to raise the watch level to maximum from guard posts located outside of the castle walls.{nl}They say that demons are coming.{nl}
The lord ordered that all soldiers including those stationed at guard posts are to accompany all residents and vassals within the castle to the device.{nl}We may finally be able to see the full might of the barrier.{nl}I divided the resident ledger by section and distributed it to all squads.
Monster of Absenta Reservoir
The astonishment of when coming across the uncanny monster called a Hydra at the Absenta Reservoir cannot be fully put into words.{nl}It has six serpentine heads, crawls on four finned feet and can also swim freely because it also has a large fin on its tail.{nl}
It lurks in the depths of the Reservoir and swallows prey in one mouthful after killing it with it's big mouth and fangs. {nl}While it is only as big as a grown man, it is very agile and has remarkable recuperative powers.{nl}Thankfully, it is not hostile towards humans allowing the nearby residents to simply call it a mystical creature and avoid it.
The sun was so nice that I decided to dry the books in the sunlight.{nl}I was afraid that they might have gone moldy if I had left them inside any longer.{nl}
If you ever wish to read something, please come in any time to have a look.{nl}It is always nice to have books read regardless of who is reading them.
(It looks as if there are a few books laying in the wooden chest.{nl}Which one should I read?)
Miscellaneous
(It looks as if there are a few books mixed in with the odds and ends.{nl}Which one should I read?)
Hirevan swallowed once.{nl}Then he lashed out at him and repeatedly used the same attacks against him{nl}Even though he knew that it was in vain..{nl}Vladislovas grew bored of toying with the young Hirevan.{nl}Next time it would be the sharpened blade instead of the hilt striking at Hirevan's throat.
Hirevan suddenly turned,{nl}drew a pistol out from it's holster and pulled the trigger.{nl}The bullet lodged itself precisely in the middle of Vladislovas' forehead, {nl}making his large body slowly collapse towards Hirevan.{nl}
Thud!
{nl}The small boat was unable to withstand the combined weight of Vladislova and Hirevan {nl}and tilted over.{nl}Waves continuously rocked the boat, {nl}and the seagulls that held their breath during the fight now started crying again.{nl}
Nobody was left standing atop of the sea.{nl}That is how the name of the Great Pirate was swept away by the waves.
You're awake! How are you feeling?
I have bad news for you.{nl}The end of the world is looming closer!{nl}
Even the Revelators that Laima is waiting for are no more...
The world is holding on for the goddesses.{nl}
But in such a state...{nl}Haha...{nl}
It will make no difference if you tell Laima or not.{nl}Don't you think so?{nl}
Where have your wings gone?{nl}An empty shell of a goddess without any powers or dignity...
But in such a state...{nl}Haha...
It will make no difference if you tell Laima or not.{nl}Don't you think so?
What happened to your wings?{nl}Oh, yes... It was me who did that, didn't I...?
Nothing more than a shell of a goddess devoid of any powers or dignity...
Mage's Writing Table
(There are two letters wedged inside the book.{nl}Should I read them?)
It's such a relief that the barrier has been deactivated!{nl}Now we will be able to pray to Zemyna.
Goddess Zemyna...
I beg of you to listen to my prayers...
Full Soul Stone
(The power that was protecting the Holy Relic of the Order disappeared as the thoughts that were confined within the Evil Thoughts Stone started slipping away.)
An unknown power seems to be blocking the way.
Pendulum
The pendulum is moving slowly in a circular pattern.
There seems to have been a subtle change in the speed at which the pendulum is moving.
The pendulum seems to have begun reacting to something.
The pendulum seems to have detected something.
The pendulum is revolving quickly.
There seems to be something nearby.

Gimmick Scarecrow
Gimmick Statue
Everything is becoming clearer now.{nl}I thank you once more.
My hometown, the Delmore Castle... is a truly beautiful place.{nl}The neighbors are so kind and the lord is also generous.{nl}
I was able to receive many rewards and apply for a long vacation {nl}thanks to my diligent service as a liaison officer.{nl}I was excited at the thought of hosting a feast with the neighbors.{nl}
But what I saw when I arrived home... was an empty town with nobody in sight.{nl}
Well, to be completely honest... It wasn't totally empty. {nl}Demons suddenly appeared from every direction.{nl}
I ran like hell. {nl}Some sights caught my eye even amongst all that chaos.{nl}
Light beads being moved somewhere, the red gemstone... I still can't forget it.{nl}That blackish red gemstone that was shining and shimmering in a nauseating way.{nl}
At first, I thought that it was a simple demon attack.{nl}That there would be survivors hiding somewhere... {nl}That my parents would have made it out safely...{nl}
I mean, it's not like demon attacks are uncommon these days...{nl}But it wasn't just an attack. All those light beads... {nl}I never knew that they were the souls of the townspeople...{nl}
You are regretting this, aren't you?{nl}I can feel it. We are sisters after all...{nl}
Are you sad?{nl}Do you... despise me?
All that pain and sadness... Despair...{nl}
All those will subside within that person...
Please, save me...
Please... the prophecy... {nl}Stop Giltine...
The chest is empty.
There is a what appears to be a pressure plate that seems to act as some sort of switch in the middle of the magic circle.
The red shards start to glow as soon as you approach the magic circle.
The red shards react to the crystal in the middle of the device.
You seem to have recovered some HP.
You seem to have recovered some SP.
Integration Device
It seems to be inactive.
You see a suspicious device.
The purpose of this magic circle is unknown.
The blue shards react as you approach the altar.
The shards form into the shape of a key accompanied by blue light.
Nothing happened.
It is a fairly old altar.
The Sicarius Key emits light.
A faint crystal appears in the center of the magic circle.
It seems to require some time to be reactivated.
Activate the magic circle?

The 5th of X{nl}-{nl}I steamed some potato dumplings to try to get to know the new neighbors.{nl}I heard some loud noises when I knocked on the door.{nl}The neighbor seemed to be quite expressionless, but lightened up at the sight of the dumplings I had brought along.{nl}
It seems that everybody that says they are followers of the goddesses are half-witted.{nl}Do you still not know my strength after all that you have been through!{nl}
I was waiting for you to come here.{nl}I will take care of you and torture the priest until the chest is unlocked!
We have long prepared to receive the Revelator in accordance to the legends.{nl}
What stands below are four sacred candlesticks...{nl}They are crafted in accordance to legend passed only to the bishops of Orsha.{nl}
So that we could bring and confirm Revelators at any time.{nl}
Now. Step onto the magic circle between the candlesticks.{nl}If you are indeed a Revelator, the magic circle will react and {nl}you will be able to oppose the Demon Lord with that power.{nl}
I thought that someone would come and try to rescue their colleague...{nl}It seems that I have caught someone completely different.{nl}
Tell me... {nl}How are you free of my power within my sphere of influence?{nl}
Yes... Of course.{nl}You are the Revelator that miss Giltine was speaking of.{nl}
Today is my lucky day.{nl}Not only have I almost found where the orders are hidden, but I also get to catch a Revelator...
There is no need for I, Marnox, to step forward.
Unbelievably, the piece of lead turned into gold in front of Modestas after a flash of suspicious light. The alchemist impudently said the following.{nl}[Now you owe me a gold bar, so make sure you bring it to me.]{nl}Modestas protested and argued, but the alchemist had never explicitly stated that what he was holding was made of lead.{nl}

Listen up, a pretty good request just came in.
Welcome.{nl}Are you looking for any requests?
Hm... This cannot be done all by your own.{nl}Speak to me again once you've gathered a few allies.
Do you want to go?
Darn... I am sorry, but I don't have an appropriate request for you.{nl}Maybe I'll have something for you next time.
Don't bite off more than you can handle. You seem to have a request already.{nl}Please come back after you've finished your current request.

Valis
There's nothing better than sparring to improve your skills!{nl}What do you say, would you like to participate?
There seems to be some sort of mysterious power indwelling in it.{nl}Would you mind me taking a closer look?
It seems research worthy.{nl}I sense an unknown power.
Unfortunately you didn't bring enough to create a combination with.{nl}Come visit me again once you've found them all.
There seems to be something missing.{nl}I think you'll have to have everything in order to realize the full power.
There now seems to be enough ready.{nl}It's all thanks to you.
I've collected all that I need for my research.{nl}Thank you for helping.
Sister Aiste
I don't think I'll be able to ask for any more help today.
I think it'll be too much to ask for more help since only the most difficult tasks remain.
I'm doing my best to stop the demons, but it will become more difficult.{nl}I'm sure I'll manage to prevail if you lend a hand.{nl}Please help me.
Sister Lhasa
Please...{nl}Although we are weak, we are holding the demons back for the sake of humanity.{nl}But our strength alone is not enough. Please! We need your help.
Thank you so much for saving me!{nl}I'm Ruina from the second group that was supposed to demolish that gate.{nl}
We came here to destroy the gate at the request of Saalus Convent.{nl}They said that monsters have been coming through that gate that suddenly appeared one day.{nl}
The advance contingent succeeded in pushing back the monsters, but failed to destroy the gate.{nl}That's why we came with divine magic scrolls and bomb materials.{nl}
But we were ambushed by a group of Hogmas on the other side of the lower bridge...{nl}We ended up losing all of our prepared bomb material.{nl}
Please.{nl}I think we'll be just be able to procure the necessary firepower {nl}to destroy the gate if you can retrieve some usable materials.
Book written in Runic Characters
This is a story about the nearly forgotten runic characters.{nl}Runic characters had been used since before the foundation of the kingdom by smaller northern tribes.{nl}Peculiarly, these people believed that the characters held magical powers.{nl}That's the reason why the northern people spent a long time to find those powers.{nl}
Finally, a person was able to find the powers dwelling in the runic characters.{nl}They do not have any powers by themselves, but they are a channel for powers that can only be manifested through them...{nl}That was the secret behind the runic characters.{nl}
He went straight to Goddess Saule and told her of the hidden powers of the runic characters, and the goddess rejoiced and blessed him.{nl}
People came to call him a 'Rune Caster'.{nl}He became the first Rune Caster Master and fostered many more Rune Casters.{nl}He also created the Rune Stone so that the new Rune Casters would easily be able to use runic characters.{nl}
One day, he vanished leaving only his Rune Stone behind.{nl}The Rune Stone he left behind has become a symbol of the way of the Rune Caster and has been passed down from master to master.
People often say that the goddesses are always with us.{nl}This is right not only in a spiritual sense but also a practical sense.{nl}That's because it symbolizes the fact that the goddesses are tending over us from their abodes.{nl}
{nl}For instance, it is said that Goddess Vaivora manages a massive library only permitted to the goddesses.{nl}This library is also the dwelling place of Goddess Vaivora.{nl}
{nl}Another example is the residence of Goddess Jurate which is rumored to be on a mysterious sea where human ships cannot reach.{nl}They say that a ship larger than most islands is the residence of Goddess Jurate.{nl}
{nl}It is said that even Goddess Vakarine that goes around numerous locations has her own abode.{nl}Some say that there is a demon prison in a dimension that we do not know of, and that is the domain of Goddess Vakarine. {nl}But that is only one of the many locations that Goddess Vakarine visits.{nl}
{nl}There are also legends that Goddess Laima has a palace deep underground where nobody knows of.{nl}There is no way to find it, it is also said that the Demon Goddess Giltine also resides there.
The Rune Stone...{nl}I haven't heard of that in a long time.{nl}
In the past, I've met a person that was searching for the {nl}special powers hidden within the runic characters.{nl}He was filled with a pure passion for the task.{nl}
He eventually found the hidden powers in the runic characters and became the first Rune Caster.{nl}A channel for power... The power of the runic characters was their {nl}ability to allow the casters to realized their strength through them.{nl}
He crafted a Rune Stone to let others use the powers of the Rune Stone with easier access.{nl}Although his Rune Stone was nothing extraordinary, the following generations of {nl}Rune Caster Masters have carefully guarded his Rune Stone out of respect...{nl}
Unfortunately his Rune Stone was lost during the Petrified City incident.{nl}That is why the Rune Caster Master is still looking for his Rune Stone.{nl}
The fact that you've come to me with knowledge of the Rune Stone... {nl}Perhaps it means that you were led here by its powers.
Yes. Although it is an old tale...{nl}I do have an idea of where the Rune Stone may be.{nl}{nl}
The last place I sensed the Rune Stone was at the Royal Mausoleum.{nl}But that was a long time ago... I don't recall exactly where I sensed it.{nl}
I remember the traveler that came to me asking for a blessing a few hundred years ago.{nl}He said that he had seen a mysterious stone with {nl}strange characters engraved on it near a waterfall.{nl}
Unfortunately I was not able to know about what was occurring{nl}around the world after I had resolved to protect the revelation.{nl}Perhaps humans may know more about the whereabouts of the Rune Stone than I do.{nl}
Yes. Maybe a human family that has survived for a long time such as the Jonas family...{nl}Someone that has eternal life like the Amjinas is sure to know something.
You mentioned 'Rune Stone', didn't you?{nl}Ah, could it be...{nl}
If you are talking about a stone with strange characters engraved on it, yes I do have one.{nl}I don't know how long it has been, but it has been in {nl}the possession of the Jonas family for generations.{nl}
But it is treated as rubbish since there is no way of knowing what it is used for.{nl}Now I know it is Rune Stone thanks to you.{nl}
Why are you searching for it though?
I see.{nl}It is useless in our hands, so we'll give it to you if you absolutely need it.{nl}
No matter how valuable an object may be, {nl}it has to be in the hands of someone that needs it to be worth anything.
You've come here in search of the Rune Stone?{nl}
I don't know where you've heard of it, but I do have one.{nl}I threw a tantrum when I was young to get it when {nl}it was gifted to the Winterspoon family long ago.{nl}
Though, that's already a few hundred years ago.{nl}Now where did I put it...
Oh, as it happens, I have it right here.{nl}I have no use for it, so you may have it if you need it.{nl}
It may have been destined for you since you are the first person {nl}to seek something that nobody wanted for hundreds of years.{nl}As a handler of time, I am thinking that perhaps it was a future promised in the past.
I can't seem to find where I've put it.{nl}I'll keep an eye out for it, so would you mind coming back later?
Do you mean the Rune Stone?{nl}
I don't have anything like that...{nl}But I do have something that comes to mind.{nl}
There is a place in West Siauliai Woods that cannot be accessed through ordinary means.{nl}I had faintly sensed a mysterious aura for a few hundred years...{nl}But I couldn't find a way to get there.{nl}
Perhaps the item you are searching for may be there.{nl}How about taking a look if you know how to get there?
Do you know that there is a place in West Siauliai Woods {nl}that cannot be accessed by ordinary means?{nl}I had sensed a mysterious aura there for hundreds of years.{nl}
I don't know how to get there, or what to expect to find there.{nl}You might be able to find something if you find a way to get there.
Rune Stone
(Unrecognizable characters are glowing.)
(It seems as if you require more Rune Stones.)
Something glowing seems to be embedded behind the tombstone.{nl}Take it out?
You can see many interesting things if you sit here.{nl}
Not too long ago, a lady that seemed to be a mage came to ask something strange.{nl}I think she was looking for a stone engraved with characters that glow blue or something?{nl}
I said I didn't know anything of the sort since I have never seen anything similar.{nl}She said something about going somewhere past Escanciu Village... I can't quite recall.
Rune Caster Master
Eh? Why am I sensing rune powers in you?{nl}
Goodness! {nl}That is the Rune Stone of the first Rune Caster Master, isn't it?{nl}
How did you manage to find it?{nl}I've been looking all over for it...{nl}
That Rune Stone... Could you give it to me, please?{nl}Although it may not mean too much to ordinary people, {nl}it means a lot to Rune Caster Masters.
Thank you so much.{nl}The Rune Stone of the first Rune Caster Master is finally back in {nl}the hands of Rune Casters after hundreds of years thanks to you.{nl}
I don't know if it is sufficient as a reward, but let me teach you a little about runic characters.{nl}While extremely rare, there are some books written in runic characters.{nl}
Perhaps if your magic is compatible with the runic characters...{nl}You may be able to become a Rune Caster.{nl}
No, I am certain that you will be able to become a Rune Caster.{nl}I think that the will of the runic characters led you here to me.{nl}
Rune Casters can cast powerful magic through Rune Stones.{nl}However, it does take a long time to gather the required magic.{nl}
Oh... Have I been talking too much about Rune Casters?{nl}My bad, but thank you so much for finding the Rune Stone.{nl}
Come back to me if you wish to become a Rune Caster.{nl}
I don't know if you could call it a reward, but I will teach you some runic characters.{nl}Although quite rare, there are occasionally some books written in runic characters.{nl}
You may be able to obtain important information from long ago.{nl}Not a bad deal, don't you agree?
Wandering Bard
Ask an owl of the forest, and he will answer.{nl}Oh, birch tree, only the owls are there for you. {nl}Oh.... Only the owls...{nl}
Oh, the youth. Oh, the beautiful...{nl}To introduce my poor self, I am a a mere dandelion seed wandering as the wind takes me.{nl}
My song flows as the wind blows, as your soul glitters brightly...{nl}Do you have an interest in the songs of this poor bard?{nl}
But poor old me. {nl}Though I wish to tell you, your lonesome friend must soon leave. {nl}Farewell...

Kupole Lhuta
Revelator, I've been waiting for you.{nl}Goddess Zemyna is hiding somewhere in this Earth Tower.
After the day in which you humans call Medzio Diena...{nl}Goddess Zemyna has hidden herself from the human realm.{nl}
The life of humans and the fertility of vegetation...{nl}Medzio Diena must have been a great woe for the goddess of fertility.
We Kupoles have asked for her presence as the humans are longing for her...{nl}But Goddess Zemyna is obstinately refusing to meet us.{nl}
To make things worse, the demons have started to attack the Earth Tower.{nl}It has become hard to even request a meeting with her because of the attacks.
Revelator, please find Goddess Zemyna.{nl}Maybe you will be able to change the goddess' mind.
If it helps finding Goddess Zemyna...{nl}I'll tell you what I know about the Earth Tower.
Unfortunately, there is not much I can tell you about Goddess Zemyna.{nl}I am sorry.
I pray that you will be able to meet Goddess Zemyna.
Relic Collector
They say that there are many artifacts from unknown periods in the Earth Tower.{nl}If you find something, how about exchanging for something I have?
There is someone who will want what we have even if the world ends.{nl}Our job is to supply it if there is a demand for it.
There is almost nothing known about the Istora Ruins.{nl}The fact that they were discovered thanks to being pushed up after Medzio Diena is about it.{nl}
Then some adventures came to know about the Earth Tower here.{nl}It won't even open unless you are a Revelator.{nl}
That's why we're making a living selling various of items to Revelators.{nl}Since only Revelators can carry relics from inside the tower.
One thousand and two hundred years ago...{nl}This tower has been built by the remaining vestiges of an ancient era forgetten by humans.{nl}
A long time ago, the humans that lived together with the goddesses...{nl}They created the tower out of desire for the goddesses.{nl}
But time erased even the memories of the tower.{nl}A thousand years after the rule of King Zachariel, only Zemyna is hiding here now.
It is certain that Goddess Zemyna is in the tower...{nl}But unfortunately, even I do not know where she could be.{nl}
As Goddess Zemyna does not wish to see anybody...{nl}I assume she is in the innermost depths of the tower.
Stories of battles with monsters and demons are always useful to the goddesses.{nl}Will you tell me a bit more?
It seems you're still lacking.{nl}Will you tell me more stories later?
New monster stories?{nl}Will you tell me more about it?
Oh, they're all stories you already told me before.{nl}Will you come see me next time?
Oh, you've been to a new region.{nl}Will you tell me about what it was like?
You already told me about that.{nl}But if you go somewhere new do come and tell me about it.
Many places have changed after Medzio Diena.{nl}The information you shared will be very useful for everyone.
It looks like you don't have any new stories to tell. {nl}Come back if you get to explore any new areas.
Because of the monsters we can't do anything the way we want.{nl}We used to go to Siauliai Woods to pick herbs, eat fruit from the trees or get some rest, {nl}but not anymore.
Living in a place with these monsters running outside is driving me insane.{nl}But because of them I can't even dare to move somewhere else...
Lately I can't do so much as get a good night of sleep.{nl}All because of the monsters.
Manual

Before you read this, please make sure no one else is around.{nl}I'm Gatre and I'm helping Sarma with his experiments.{nl}Sarma approached me saying he wanted to do research to get the forest's fruit trees back to normal.{nl}
We had lost a place to live after the trees grew too big and we couldn't eat the fruits, so Sarma's proposal appealed to us.{nl}He offered to share food with whoever helped him so most people from my village ended up accepting.{nl}
At first we worked hard to help him save our hometown.{nl}But then Sarma's research started to feel somewhat strange.{nl}It seems like Sarma's research has little to do with getting the overgrown trees back to normal.{nl}The experiments are mostly done on monsters, not on trees, and I've even fallen unconscious during one experiment.{nl}
I suspect Sarma is doing this to cover up for something evil.{nl}Since I have no proof, there's really nothing I can do.{nl}I can't ask you to trust every single word of mine,{nl}but I at least want to know if my suspicions are correct or if I'm simply overthinking it.{nl}
I'm being watched by Sarma almost constantly. {nl}Please understand that this is the only way I could communicate this to you.{nl}If you agree to help me, when you bring back this manual please say you did everything according to it.
Discarded Document
For the experiment, we collected juice and seeds from the fruits of the overgrown trees.{nl}We were lost in despair, but now we feel hope again.{nl}I only wish this research will bring back our town...
Sarma asked us to capture a weak monster.{nl}We aren't fit for fighting, but we did our best for the village and managed to catch a monster.{nl}Only a few people were injured in the process.
Sarma was looking for a volunteer for an important experiment.{nl}We don't know much about magic or experiments, but he said anyone would do.{nl}This time, only he and Boldas, who volunteered, participated in the experiment.{nl}
Then, 5 days later... the accident.{nl}We heard a strange scream and, after following the sound, we found Boldas lying on the ground unconscious.{nl}Sarma said the experiment had failed and apologized.
Yesterday I went inside the place where Sarma did the experiment.{nl}I didn't notice it when we were trying to save Boldas, but looking closely there were traces of a struggle all around.{nl}I also saw hideous monster corpses that seemed to have been melted by something.{nl}What kind of experiment could he have done with that?

He created Rune Stones to allow people to easily use their power.{nl}His runes may have been common, but the best Rune Caster Masters have {nl}great respect for him, and have treasured and carried on his runes to this day...{nl}
Yes. It's an old story but...{nl}I had a hunch about the location of those Rune Stones.
After that, the shepherd and the girl would often meet and play together.{nl}They say the girl didn't talk much and could only string together a few simple words.{nl}
Naturally, priests learning the teachings of the goddesses{nl}are not permitted to use them unless it's for research.
Unlike the other goddesses, Laima, the goddess of fate and foresight, exists only in records. {nl}Goddess Laima's encounters with humans are scarce and so are her known blessings, making her a lesser known deity despite being one of the main goddesses.{nl}

I never thought you'd interfere...{nl}But there is no time to fight your people.
There isn't much time left... Soon we can bring her back.{nl}If you try to stop me I will turn this land into your graves.
Your time is almost up...{nl}Until when are you going to keep trying to stop me! Lemija!{nl}
...Alright.{nl}Let's bring out the friend you wanted to meet so much...
Missing Adomas

I knew he had returned to the goddess...{nl}But in a way it's good to know I can now bury him in my heart...{nl}

I come before you once again to share the teachings of the Divine Tree.{nl}Only those who believe in the Divine Tree can receive salvation.
The world was turned over by monsters... and who saved you?{nl}Was it the goddesses, who neglected you and then disappeared without a trace?{nl}
Or, I ask, was it the monks, the liars who locked you in this monastery and then deserted you?
That's right.{nl}Only the Divine Tree can save you, and no one else.{nl}
Medzio Diena was but a warning to the arrogant goddesses.{nl}If we believe in the Divine tree and receive salvation, we will become one within the tree.{nl}
Then we shall be blessed with eternal life!

Suspicious Note
Occupying Elgos Monastery{nl}-{nl}1. Free monsters in Nahash Forest to drive Paramesh Village residents into the monastery.{nl}-{nl}2. Make crops multiply to separate the villagers from the monks.{nl}
3. Make them think the monks ran away and abandoned the monastery.{nl}-{nl}4. Teach the hopeless villagers about the great deed of the Order of the Tree of Truth.
The grace of the Divine Tree has fallen upon you to save you from starvation!{nl}
The power of the tree will multiply your crops and feed your people!
What are all these bugs...{nl}This must be the wrath of the Divine Tree!{nl}
Someone among us must doubt the might of the Divine Tree!{nl}Who, I ask, dares to think of such sacrilege!{nl}
...Ever since they came the demons became difficult to control.
It was you!{nl}You are the one who dares to doubt the might of the Divine Tree!

I knew you were a Revelator from the beginning.{nl}My mind control powers didn't work on you...{nl}
But I was careless.{nl}I didn't think you'd break through my barrier so easily... You're no ordinary fool.
The curse to multiply the crops is ready.{nl}But I can't have you around and risk you ruining our plans.{nl}
This is the judgment of the Divine Tree!{nl}Be doomed, you and the monastery!!
I may have failed once, but I won't be deterred!{nl}You just wait and see.
This time... I know I received help but...{nl}Vaidotas... I really hate him...
I was definitely possessed by something...{nl}I felt like I was in a dream...
To think I spread demon blood all over the monastery...{nl}I need to help the monks clean it now...
Thank you for saving us from the Order of the Tree of Truth. {nl}The power of the goddesses was corrupted, they said; what a ridiculous idea...
Lucienne helped us a lot, too.{nl}She was the one who released Dominikas.{nl}
I'm going to take care of the village now... and the monastery.{nl}There's really nothing I can say to the monks.
The crops never multiplied like Dominikas said.{nl}Did the curse not work?
Suspicious Pouch

I will try to find what I can.{nl}Let's talk again later.
It seems we're getting close to finding an solution.{nl}You've been very helpful.
Will you look at the corals around the area where this Agnim came from?{nl}It'll be a great help to the refugees.
We used to get by even with the occasional tribute.{nl}But now... with the extra tribute to pay to the Lord Lieutenant, we can barely survive.{nl}
Everything was wrong.{nl}I need to get away...
Something strange that happened recently?{nl}Sigh, don't even mention it.{nl}
I thought it smelled like rotten fish at first.{nl}Didn't you smell it?{nl}
Anyways, it never smelled like that when a monster died.{nl}Then one day it started to smell weird and suddenly it was crowded with monsters. Really.
Something strange that happened recently?{nl}
I don't know...{nl}Other than the sea by my town drying out because of Medzio Diena, not really.{nl}
Well, if anything...{nl}The Lord Lieutenant is suddenly acting all bossy and important, does that count?
A strange smell fills the air. Shall we investigate?
A strange smell fills the air. The pouch could be around here.
I want to know how my family is doing but I'm scared of the monsters so I can't go back.{nl}I really regret running away.
You say you brought some Rune Stones?{nl}
You expect me to just sign your petition?{nl}No. You should at least pay me...
Yes, I'm aware of what Horacius is doing.{nl}I knew this day would come. I'll gladly sign my name.
Kalejimas. Such a delightful word!
(A warning sign is visible.)
Now you just need to find the food stolen by the ferrets and coat it with some red water.{nl}They hid the food in between the fruit baskets.{nl}
Find something to throw at the monsters.
Try throwing something.
(There is no reaction.)
Kabbalist Lutas
Ah! Sorry!{nl}That hidden magic circle is made to catch monsters, I didn't know it would catch people!{nl}
Just a moment.{nl}I'll disable it in a second.
Oh my...{nl}The earthquake is getting stronger.{nl}
I'll quickly draw up a magic circle.{nl}Meanwhile, protect me from the monsters so I can concentrate.
W-What's this?!{nl}No!!
The magic circle should disappear if its magic core is destroyed. Try and throw something at it.

A new disaster is brewing in this prison.{nl}The demons are invading through the dimensional crack, {nl}and are trying to take over this prison as a new base.{nl}

The fear of demons made us forget who we truly are.{nl}

Because of Helgasercle, a great chaos will come down on this world. {nl}It's a desperate gamble to leave the tower to a goddess who should be taking care of the world's flame.

Have you brought the handicraft with you?
May be the goddess' blessings be upon you.{nl}We must protect more of those who the goddess favors.
I'm sure you'll do a great job.
What should I explain first?
We, the Loremasters, are the clerics who followed Goddess Jurate.
Unfortunately, Goddess Jurate no longer responds to us...{nl}Such disconnection decreased the number of clerics and only the rituals and traditions remain.
However! If we don't let this golden opportunity slip by...{nl}We believe that Goddess Jurate could answer us again.
Goddess Jurate is the goddess of the sea.{nl}
But the thing is, how shall I put this...{nl}She loves the ocean more than she does humans.{nl}
She is mostly despondent...{nl}The offerings or prayers from the surface do not interest her, so she often went into the ocean.
She went even as far as to tell our high priest not to go out to the ocean.{nl}She no longer answers to our prayers.{nl}
But faith isn't something that can be abandoned easily.{nl}The lifespan of our Order is almost over... This just makes us even more desperate.
This land you stand on is a fairly new one.{nl}It emerged from the ocean on Medzio Diena.{nl}
Goddess Jurate told us not to go out to the sea...{nl}But we believe that this land would be a good place for us to pray to her without violating her words.{nl}
There are other places that emerged from underwater.{nl}But none had such oceanic energy so abundant as this one.
You have already buried the powder.{nl}On to the next spot.
Goddess Jurate
You have found the place that is simultaneously land and sea...{nl}Loremasters, your will has been heard.{nl}
In the past, I took no side nor interest in the affairs of the goddesses and demons.{nl}But after Medzio Diena, the sea has changed, too.{nl}
The ocean becoming land. The land becoming the ocean...{nl}Those who fled to survive...{nl}
Their desparate prayers dimly echoing.{nl}However, Medzio Diena and the demons defiling the ocean are making me weak.
I cannot ignore it any longer..{nl}From now on, your prayers shall be answered.
No reaction. It's just a stone.
The stone is glowing blue.

One demon barrier is down.{nl}Four more to go now.
Let's head to the Storage now.{nl}There's another spirit there hiding from the monsters.
That's two barriers.{nl}We should be fine if we keep going at this pace.
Be careful around the Solitary Cells.{nl}You never know when the demons will be on to us.
You heard about the intruder, right?{nl}I'm thinking it's Zanas.{nl}
This is someone who took his own life to become a spirit and escape.{nl}He's gonna be in trouble when we find him.
Didn't Grinender catch Zanas' spirit?{nl}They should be at the Common Room... Did you go an salute?
It's an order to capture the intruder.{nl}If it's human we kill them, if it's Zanas we take him.
Grinender created a powerful magic circle.{nl}No intruder is gonna enter the Common Room.
Only those with the Grinender Seal can get past the magic circle.{nl}You didn't lose yours, did you?
This makes three demon barriers down.{nl}
Let's go to the Workshop.{nl}Nebulas has another one of my spirits there.{nl}
We'll know more if we rescue that spirit.{nl}Meet me at the Worshop.
Wall
There's something written here.{nl}Shall we read some of it?
What will you use?
There's only one demon barrier left now.
I still have a bad feeling somehow.{nl}We should be careful in the Interrogation Room.
I... I feel a very intese power in Nebulas.{nl}This is dangerous.{nl}
We should get out of here.{nl}I'll use the Teleport Magic Scroll!
This is my last calling.{nl}I just hope this will be enough to complete my mission.{nl}
I'll deploy the Dominance Magic now.{nl}Once it's activated, I'll be gone forever.{nl}
I'm sorry I couldn't be with you until the end.{nl}Defeat Nebulas, take back the revelation.
It's too late, Nebulas!{nl}The demon barrier will be destroyed and you too will end at the hands of the Revelator.
Savior.{nl}Many are those who continue to sacrifice for the salvation of our world.{nl}
I knew well what destiny awaited Zanas...{nl}And I knew he himself was ready to accept it, yet I had no choice but to trust him with the revelation.{nl}
The power that led Zanas, a mere boy, unto the revelation...{nl}His last breath, his last prayer... were but for your own and our world's salvation.{nl}
He shall be remembered for as long as I live.{nl}
I understand this is a sin that cannot be forgiven.{nl}But the lives being lost in our world every day are far too many.{nl}
A grave disaster is upon us...{nl}The same disaster that forced us to give up on the petrification curse, that nearly reduced the kingdom to ruins.{nl}
The goddess that could not be saved will soon be free of Her chains.{nl}
Past chains of a relinquished salvation crushing Her...{nl}The one taken by the curse of the demon queen shall descend once more as the Goddess of Destruction.{nl}
Savior. You must go to the caves holding the hidden goddess captive.{nl}Please... protect Her from the demon queen.
Letters of a Prisoner
To my dear parents,{nl}How are you? I hope you're safe and healthy.{nl}I sneaked out of breakfast today to write to you.{nl}Sorry I couldn't reply sooner; I was busy.{nl}Weekdays always make me a little anxious.{nl}On prayer days, the prison guards don't mind us as much so it's not that bad.{nl}
I'm doing well myself.{nl}I'm not sick or hurt.{nl}Not much is left for me of this hard prison life, either.{nl}Who knows, I could be free by the time this letter reaches you.{nl}To think it was all because of one mistake... I sure regret those days.{nl}I miss you a lot.{nl}Your son, Gav.{nl}
P.S.{nl}The guards said there was an earthquake at the capital.{nl}Is everything okay in Fedimian?{nl}Please, be careful.
Let me have a look.{nl}
Hmm... This was written by Gav. He used to live around here ten years ago.{nl}I'm too old to remember why he was in prison, but...{nl}
I know his parents moved to Delmore a few years ago.{nl}They did return to Fedimian a couple of times after that... but we lost touch lately.{nl}
You can leave the letter to me.{nl}I'll make sure to deliver it to them when they return.
Zanas' Echo
I can hear my own voice...{nl}That must mean Nebulas was defeated and you have the revelation.{nl}
That's great.{nl}I knew you could do it.{nl}
I spent a lot of time in prison.{nl}Wondering... I'm just a man, what could I possibly do?{nl}
I spent years hiding the revelation...{nl}And many more trying to protect it from the demons.{nl}
I was chased by them and had no choice but to split my spirit with a magic device...{nl}It was not fun.{nl}
I became tired...{nl}Waiting for a Revelator I wasn't even sure was going to come.{nl}
And then you appeared.{nl}I could finally complete my mission.{nl}
I couldn't stay for long but...{nl}I'm glad you're the Revelator.{nl}
There's no way I could defeat Nebulas without you.{nl}I dunno about you, but I made a really precious friend here.{nl}
Sorry I couldn't be with you until the end.{nl}And thank you.{nl}
Goodbye?
The sound of Zanas' voice is heard.
There seems to be a sound coming from somewhere.
Reagent Maker
What materials do you wish to use?
Recipe List
Overgrowth Neutralizer{nl}A neutralizing agent for returning plants affected by an overgrowth solution to their normal state.{nl}First, you'll need the black catalyst solution from the storage.{nl}Add the catalyst to the reagent making magic circle to make the neutralizer.{nl}
How to Use the Reagent Making Circle{nl}First, you need to add magic to the reagent making circle.{nl}You will see lights appear around the circle after you add the magic.{nl}Activate the lights starting from the fastest one to turn on the magic circle.{nl}
Antidote{nl}A solution to detoxify overgrown plants.{nl}You will need Barha herbs and Griba juice.{nl}With the reagent maker, process the Barha herbs on high temperature and and Griba juice on medium temperature.{nl}Pour both processed ingredients in a flask and add water to make the antidote.{nl}
How to Enhance an Antidote{nl}Antidotes alleviate the symptoms of intoxication, but they don't completely remove the toxins.{nl}As such, there is a need to enhance this effect.{nl}Sarma found from research that adding specific ingradients can increase the power of antidotes tenfold.
Sarma's Research Documents
I found by experimenting that Rafflesias aren't affected by venom.{nl}The results show that their sticky sap is resistant to toxins.{nl}By adding sticky Rafflesia sap to an antidote solution, then, I verified a remarkable increase in its effectiveness.{nl}Using this could allow the other researchers to work with stronger types of poison.
I can't move around because of the demon barriers.{nl}There's five of them, you see?
I think we can talk here.
We'll need memories if we're going to get the Revelatin back.{nl}I should round up my spirits.
I don't know what I'd do if the demons had found me first while I was hiding.{nl}Fortunately you're here now, I'm glad.
We need to be really careful from now on.
The demons gotta be out of their minds by now.{nl}We should move.
We need the memories of my spirit that's in the workshop.{nl}It'll have important clues about the revelation.
I'm glad you came before it was too late.{nl}I bet Goddess Laima is the one who guided you here.
We're almost done gathering up my spirits.{nl}We'll find the revelation in no time.
Something's wrong.{nl}I have this weird feeling.
Nebulas is not one to be joked with.{nl}We should hurry.
A curious object arrived at the Alliance recently.{nl}It came from outside the kingdom, but there was a slight problem with it.{nl}
It's a sort of stick with strips of paper on it, and whoever touches it starts to see ghosts and other strange things.{nl}People at the Alliance were talking about disposing of it, they think it's evil.{nl}
I'm not sure if we should throw it away though.{nl}Will you have a look at it instead?{nl}Who knows, it could be important.
Divine Spirit Gem
A strange energy is felt in the air.
Something went wrong...{nl}Try another way.
There isn't much of a reaction?
Abandoned Altar
There is no reaction?
Divine Spirit Sphere
The Divine Spirit Sphere disappeared without any other reaction?
Huh?{nl}Is that a gohei?{nl}
I met this person wearing some funny-looking clothes the other day and they had one too.{nl}Looks like they came from outside of the kingdom...{nl}
They said something about what they were doing but I can't remember what.{nl}They were headed to the bee farm though?
They asked how to get to the bee farm.{nl}So I told them, you take the shortcut from the underground passage and you're there.
If only we had the skill, we could go with you and help you...{nl}I'm just sorry about my own limitations.
To think they wanted to kidnap a person and run away...{nl}That was no normal human being.
My father has been bedridden for a long time.{nl}An elder who came by our village had a look at him the other day.{nl}He used to be a doctor and said Tini shiny horns will help.
I came to Thaumas Trail because this is our last hope.{nl}But fighting those monsters is just too much for me.
{nl}Please.{nl}Get the Tini shiny horns for me.
Right. The Order helped us a lot on our way here.{nl}They were nothing but friendly to us.
{nl}The way they worship the goddesses may be a little different, but taking over the monastery...{nl}I don't think the monks are lying, but I can't believe that.
My friend is not one to tell lies.
{nl}Someone who believes in good would never take over a monastery and expel the monks.{nl}I'll take my friend's word and cancel this pilgrimage.
We came all the way here, so we'll keep heading to the monastery for now.{nl}The Order of the Tree of Truth I know wouldn't harm us.
{nl}Take care, then. We'll be on our way.
Thank you.{nl}With all these monsters around it's hard to pull myself together, as much as I want to.
{nl}If you don't see any leaves, try again later.{nl}Some leaves may have fallen meanwhile.
Deaft the Yellow Dumaros in this region.
Old Tomb
Here lies a humble servant of the goddess who all sacrificed until their deserved eternal rest.{nl}To fill the world with the grace of the goddesses.{nl}To protect it from the evil hands of the demons.
Uh...hm? What?{nl}I don't know either.
{nl}I'm just tired... I made it all the way here and now I can't even go inside the monastery...{nl}Tree of Truth followers only.
I don't know why I'm so tired. Are you okay?{nl}Usually this place would be filled with monsters?
{nl}Not anymore though.{nl}Ever since the Order of the Tree of Truth put that black crystal there, they don't even dare to come near.
{nl}The crystal is a relic from the Divine Tree, they say.{nl}Seeing how the monsters won't even dare to come close, I'd say they're right.
I do feel a little sluggish... but the people from the Order said not to worry.{nl}It's all part of receiving the blessing of the Divine Tree, they said.
{nl}There's nothing to worry about if we just listen to them...{nl}Truth is, nothing they said so far is wrong.
{nl}Let me tell you a secret. The crystal in the Shinikti Vacant Lot is a goddess!{nl} Every night it turns into Goddess Lada and tells us to believe the teachings of the Tree of Truth?
We've all been blessed by the Divine Tree and the goddess.{nl}And I know...
{nl}This is all because of the Order of the Tree of Truth...{nl}Goddess Vakarine also appears every night, telling us to follow the Order.
{nl}They chased away the monsters... they set up a divine relic.{nl}You can go the Shinikti Vacant Lot if you want to pray to the relic?
High Officer Domantas
You. I remember you. Said your name was Stella, was it?{nl}You ought to convert to the Divine Tree already if you don't want to end up like the others.
{nl}You may have been innocent yourself, but the monastery was corrupt.{nl}Do you deny that there were demons among you?
{nl}Let's not be stubborn now. That helper your brought won't be of any use to you.{nl}I trust that you know what I'm capable of by now.
I remember the day you mercilessly slaughtered my brothers very well indeed.
{nl}I have but three things to tell you.{nl}One, I will never abandon the teachings of the goddess.
{nl}Two, the person next to me is not a common traveler, but a Revelator.
{nl}Three, the real demons are hiding among you!{nl}Allow me to prove it.
Mattas, what happened?{nl}You... you converted to the Order of the Tree of Truth?
I'm deeply ashamed... But I had no other choice.{nl}They captured us and kept us starved?
{nl}The pain was unimaginable.{nl}It was as if my entire body was burning down?
{nl}I realize there are still brothers who refuse to surrender.{nl}My words must sound like an excuse.
{nl}However... They're not just starving them, they're threatening their own lives!
{nl}When the goddesses themselves show no signs of returning, there is no hope whatsoever.
You're wrong.{nl}The goddesses will shine the light of salvation upon us.
{nl}I have with me a Revelator.{nl}Leave behind your past mistakes and help us take back the monastery.
What did you say?{nl}This is... a Revelator?
{nl}That means we have a real chance of expelling the Order from the monastery!{nl}
Please, let me help.{nl}I shall pay for my sin after we recover the monastery.
Very well. However...{nl}Did you happen to see the keeper of the monastery keys among the brothers who escaped?
I did see them, but...{nl}To tell you the truth about what happened... I'm very sorry.
{nl}The keeper was taken by High Officer Medea and lost their life.{nl}The keys are with Medeja now, I'm afraid.
{nl}Medea was here on duty at the time, unfortunately.
{nl}She specializes in hallucinations.{nl}She can make others see what she wants, I imagine that's why she was working outside the monastery.
{nl}She did say, however, that she had been sent by the High Officer of an organization above the Order.{nl}The strong divine energy of the monastery was interfering with their power; she came to suppress it.
{nl}High Officer Domantas is also attempting to contaminate the energy of the monastery.{nl}They both want to suppress its divine power.
{nl}I was called for this very same task and was reporting to them the locations where the energy is strongest.
It's a shame to see such a kind person gone...{nl}But this is not the time to commiserate.
{nl}We must stop Medea's cruel deeds and take back the keys to the monastery.{nl}Brother Mattas. How can we lure Medea?
Destroying the energy suppressing devices as you intended is likely the best way to go about it.{nl}There are more in Rijekavi Fields and Krasjia Hill.
{nl}Go and destroy both devices.{nl}I'll stay with Medea and convince her to take matters into her own hands.
{nl}May the divine grace of the goddesses be with you both.
You're very hardworking.{nl}Managed to get the last device in the end.
{nl}You seem uncertain.{nl}There should be nothing more to hide now, should there?
Did you not hear about my specialty?{nl}That's a shame. The one called Stella is already under my power.
{nl}She's rather popular with the monks, isn't she?{nl}Having her surrender will do wonders in converting them.{nl}Do you see? This was all to get to you both.
{nl}I heard you defeated Domantas. Not quite the commoner, are you?{nl}And yet, you were no match for my wits.
{nl}You have no choice now but to become a loyal puppet of our Order.{nl}When my superiors see your talent, losing one or two devices will be nothing but a minor concern to them.
{nl}Now, convert to the Order.
Not a weak mind, I see, you can even move inside that magic circle.{nl}But then, I'd already figured that from the way you refused my kind proposal. I guess you've made your mind, then?
The magic circle is activated.{nl}Fortunately we have brother Mattas watching out for us.
{nl}Let's head to the monastery now.
It seems, not enough demons have been defeated to satisfy the dead.
High Officer Deimantas
Well look who we have here.{nl}If it isn't Stella, head of the monastery library!
{nl}I heard a lot about you from the other monks. Nice to finally meet you.{nl}I figured you would do anything to come back, from the things I heard.
{nl}Are you perhaps here to rescue the brothers?{nl}Seeing how you broke the barrier, you seem not just brave but rather clever as well.
{nl}I'm afraid your brothers will soon join our Order, however.{nl}And you will be next, of course. The question is whether we need to force you or not.
{nl}The so-called Revelator you brought along has hurt my kin and can therefore not be spared, but you...{nl}I am giving you a final chance.
{nl}Be reborn under the Order of the Tree of Truth.

It's been confirmed that the king commands a large army. {nl}But if General Hayatin can muster enough volunteer soldiers,{nl}the incompetent king will likely surrender or retreat.
Alas, everything occurred as Laima predicted.{nl}All we could do was endure this long and strenuous war, weakened as we were.{nl}

King Zachariel had made many arrangements for future generations. {nl}We and the Jonas family were one of them. {nl}But the meaning of the arrangements is only known by the goddess. {nl}At least we know that the will of the king that we are protecting and the secret of the tomb indicates one person.{nl}
We've finally arrived in front of the Zachariel's Royal Mausoleum. {nl}He was the first king of this kingdom and used an enormous number of people to build it. {nl}I believe only this place can answer the question I've had in my mind for a long time.{nl}
There are mainly two ways to spread the curse. {nl}First, using equipment and uttering simple words. It sounds easy but it is, in fact, the hardest way. {nl}Therefore, from the example of the Pilgrim's Way, we mainly use the cursed ones as the mediums to spread the curse.{nl}
They say there are many holy relics hidden in the Tenet Church. {nl}Some of them are said to transport people to a place where no one can go... {nl}Amazing, isn't it?
Shapeshifting is a very profound type of magic, but simply learning it will not make you stronger.{nl}If you can't use it in battle, you're better off learning something else.

I found by experimenting that Rafflesias aren't affected by venom.{nl}The results show that their sticky sap is resistant to toxins.{nl}By adding sticky Rafflesia sap to an antidote solution, then, I verified a remarkable increase in its effectiveness.{nl}Using this could allow the other researchers to work with stronger types of poison.
Unlike priests who control the blessing of the goddess directly, {nl}the wizard is defined as a person who releases various magic information or the blessing of the goddess.

You're a Revelator that has reached Rank 8.{nl}This is a small gift for all of those that have endeavored to bring peace to the world.

The thief who had foolishly entered this tower to rob it was burned alive. {nl}At the very least, the monuments he left will serve as a warning to other trespassers. {nl}- Agailla Flurry
Fedimian is a very old city, and is surrounded by countless ruins and wonders. {nl}The Mage Tower, the Cursed City and the Great Cathedral are the most noteworthy.
The goddesses left several things in the hands of the first Paladin.{nl}For instance, the threat of Demon Queen Gesti, the commandments and much more...{nl}
You must be the one who released Goddess Saule.{nl}What are you putting your life on the line for?
Trees become bigger as years pass.{nl}There are only Woodmen here, but when you think of the large trees or even the giant tree that stands in the old capital city...{nl}You can't help but think of the existence of even larger tree monsters.{nl}We must always consider the possibility, since so many plants turned into monsters after the disaster.
It seems as if it needs a bit more purification...
While I was doing that, I learned of the field of accumulation. {nl}It's an empty field. The theory of the beginning and the end is a fantastic library,{nl}at the boundary of transcendency, all for one purpose.

The First Clue
{@ST43}First{/}{nl}There are Broken Magic Circles and Magic Stones left.
The Second Clue
{@ST43}Second{/}{nl}There are many locations and devices on the documents that are difficult to see as military use.
The Third Clue
{@ST43}Third{/}{nl}There is a magic circle that reacts by blinking a green light.{nl}This magic circle is top secret.
The Fourth Clue
{@ST43}Fourth{/}{nl}The Wall Maintenance Mage had researched chemicals that kill or stunt the growth of plants.
{@ST43}Second{/}{nl}There are many locations and devices on the documents that are difficult to see as military use.
The Fifth Clue
{@ST43}Fifth{/}{nl}The magically enhanced paper contained Operation Orders.{nl}The Orders mentioned 'The Day of Revelation' and measures to take when it happens.
Kupole Jore
Wait.{nl}I think we're looking at something the wrong way.
Let's take a closer look.{nl}I'm sure we missed something.
Perhaps the true meaning of the Three Layered Castle Wall is...
Yes! That's it.{nl}There was a reason why Goddess Laima raised the walls here!
I don't think that makes sense.{nl}I think something might come to me... Let's think this one through carefully.
Kupole Liepa
I think that our current hypothesis is faulty.{nl}Let's try thinking this through once more.
But it says that there was oil in the oil barrels...{nl}Why would the Oil Barrels be out of the storage if they weren't used during Medzio Diena?
Yes...{nl}I get it now.
There's something bothering me about considering that as an answer.{nl}Let's try rethinking it.
{@ST43}First{/}{nl}The Impact Absorption Magic Circles are all full of magic
{@ST43}Second{/}{nl}There are no oil barrels in storage.
{@ST43}Third{/}{nl}All of the oil barrels are out of storage and are full of Oil.
{@ST43}Fourth{/}{nl}The Flamethrowing Magic Stone is functional and spews flames to all that approach.
{@ST43}Fifth{/}{nl}There are action plans that indicate preparations for Medzio Diena.
Being stationed at the Wall is so tiresome.{nl}When I listen to my friends stationed elsewhere, it seems as if we have at least twice as much work to do.{nl}I have no idea why they're so concerned about this place.
This place must be important to someone when looking at the frequency of visits from higher-ups.{nl}I hate how much we have to clean the place and look disciplined every time they come over.
There are rumors that the Wall was constructed for use against demons as well as humans.{nl}There may be some truth in these rumors when you take in the fact that it has three layers, as well as a large amount of magic circles and mysterious devices all over the place.
Whenever someone comes from the capital, they always seem to have a long talk in the commander's quarters.{nl}Normally, soldiers are prohibited from approaching during those meetings. A colleague has managed to catch a glimpse of them hiding something in a box though.
Emergency Orders
These are orders of the highest priority, so see to it that they are carried out immediately.{nl}
First, all commanding officers are to report to the Royal Palace at once.{nl}
Second, do not be alarmed as there may be large scale tremors due to the testing of new military equipment.{nl}
Third, the entire maintenance crew of the Flamethrower Magic Circle and Magic Stones are to head to the education field.{nl}They are not required to hand over their tasks to other soldiers.{nl}
Fourth, there has been an issue with the magic circle that controls the core.{nl}All soldiers protecting the Outer Wall Cores are to fall back for safety purposes.
Revelation Day Action Plans
You are to activate all of the prepared magic circles.{nl}It will take longer than one might think, as they consume a lot of magic.{nl}You will not be able to activate them again after using them, unless they are recharged.{nl}
The Oil Barrel Manager is to spray all of the oil on the Walls.{nl}After that, he is to activate the Flamethrower Magic Stones.{nl}Not even the soldier who activates the Stone will be able to escape, for there will be flames strong enough to burn the walls.{nl}
As such, the soldier must be sacrificed.{nl}This is a necessary sacrifice to save the Kingdom.{nl}The family of the soldier is to be given proper compensation for their loss.{nl}
If it is deemed to be unstoppable despite the above measures, you are to activate the Cores on the Outer Walls.
Operation Orders
All measures that have been in preparation must be put in place on Revelation Day.{nl}Set fire to the Wall and spray Withering Potion on the required places.{nl}You are to also activate the Retrogression Magic Circle immediately to return it to where it came from.{nl}This will override any other orders and must be followed at all costs.
There are many bottles filled with a wine colored liquid...
Inner Wall District 8 Management Book
...{nl}All magic circles are managed differently.{nl}You will be able to check the magic circles with the Magical Eye.{nl}They must be managed according to their colors, which can be seen when using the Eye.{nl}The Magical Eye is in the Storage Room.{nl}...
Magic Circle Maintenance Department
The Magical Eye shows different colors according to the type of magic circle.{nl}Yellow represents healing properties and green represents top secret military grade circles which require careful handling.
As the base property is that of a plant, I believe that this research will help when the day comes.{nl}No, it must be of help when that day comes.
Research into Chronomancy has resulted in returning a blooming flower to its bulb.{nl}Although we have only succeeded with small flowers over a short period of time, it still shows great promise.
We discovered that the sap from a peculiar plant allows other plants to grow at an unprecedented rate.{nl}We may be able to reverse its effect to make plants grow smaller.
We tried applying Chronomancy to the sap we had previously acquired.{nl}We were able to temporarily halt plant growth.{nl}It didn't have any effect on animals, but it was able to affect plant growth for a few hours.
We have obtained some Wugushi poison that is said to be particularly effective against vegetation.{nl}We used it to create a wine colored liquid that is capable of withering plants in a very short time.{nl}I believe that we will be able to use this to wither large plants in a manner of minutes.
I think that we've got this wrong.{nl}Let's try another theory.
Aha...!{nl}I think we've figured out the secrets of the Wall!
Miko Master
Wait. I feel the energies of a Divine Spirit within you.{nl}How can this be?{nl}
Is that... Gohei?{nl}It even has a Divine Spirit residing in it.{nl}
It may be from one of the Miko Masters that came to the Kingdom long ago.{nl}You know, I think we can utilize it to help with the problems plaguing the Kingdom...
We seem to always be underhanded in this line of work.{nl}Come back to see me if you have an interest in becoming a Miko.{nl}
I sense that the Divine Spirits residing in the Gohei have taken a liking to you as well.{nl}An individual that Divine Spirits like will be able to adjust to Miko work easily.
We seem to constantly be underhanded in this line of work.{nl}I always hope that there will be more volunteers willing to work as Mikos...{nl}
Thank you anyways.{nl}Our work was made a bit easier thanks to the Gohei you brought us.
The Divine Spirits seem to like you even if you aren't linked to the Miko path in any way.{nl}
The Kannushi always has something to criticize.{nl}Stuff about always having to be modest and to persevere and such.{nl}
Protect the weak and show any bad guys why they shouldn't be bad!{nl}Don't you think that's enough?
It's so irritating.{nl}I'm already busy as it is by myself, but there always seems to be something else that pops up.{nl}
Not too long ago, I had to nurse a weakened Water Divine Spirit, as well as take care of a fiesty demon.{nl}I wasted time on the way back as well trying to help someone that was lost.{nl}I don't even know this area myself.{nl}
Then I had to go and visit the Earth Divine Spirit, and also go and tend to a Divine Spirit who was depressed because the house he had been protecing had collapsed.{nl}Not only that...{nl}
What? Why are you looking at me like that?{nl}Let me tell you, I'm not doing this because I want to.{nl}I'm only doing this because I have to as a Miko.
Would you really do that?{nl}Thanks.{nl}
I'm a Miko from a relatively famous Shrine outside of the Kingdom.{nl}I am researching the calamities that happened after Medzio Diena on the the orders of the Kannushi.{nl}
It was all fine and well up to the point where I became the Miko Master...{nl}I haven't had a moment to rest after Medzio Diena.{nl}
There I was, thinking that I would be able to relax in my room sipping tea after becoming Master.{nl}That was so naive of me...{nl}
It's an annoyance, but the Kannushi did ask me to look into matters, and I can't really leave the Divine Spirits trembling in terror either.{nl}So that's why I am going around putting barriers up, finding Divine Spirits and settling matters.

The owl can no longer argue its place to the dragon now that night has fallen.
Divine Spirit
I am a Divine Spirit helping the Miko Master Hitomiko.{nl}I know more about her than anyone else.
Hitomiko came here because of the Divine Spirits.{nl}Those who had been awakened long ago in the Capital.{nl}
Any of the antique items from the Royal Family could have Divine Spirits residing in them.{nl}They have awakened by recieving spiritual energy from the Divine Tree for a long time.{nl}
However, that spiritual energy was cut after Medzio Diena...{nl}They were about to... I believe the word they use here is 'explode'?{nl}
Hitomiko couldn't let the precarious situation be left unattended...{nl}Especially since Princess Kaonilla could be put in danger, as she is always surrounded by the antiques of the Royal Family.{nl}
That's why she came here, even though she knew she might not be welcomed.{nl}
Why can't the Priests feel the Divine Spirits?{nl}Hmm... think of it as the inability to see things at a distance while using a magnifying glass.{nl}Though, I'm not quite sure myself.{nl}
Hitomiko managed to gain Princess Kaonilla's permission to prepare the ritual.{nl}She needed to know how the Divine Spirits looked after Medzio Diena.{nl}
I think that the ritual itself was nothing new to Hitomiko.{nl}However, it must have been something surreal to the royalty and priests watching her.{nl}
You know, the way she would sway the Gohei and sprinkle something.{nl}Seeing blue energies emerge from certain items to go into Hitomiko's red pouch was a sight to behold.{nl}
Finally, the red pouch was placed on the black table with the golden silks that Hitomiko had crafted...{nl}The pouch was then burned by Hitomiko, in front of numerous onlookers.{nl}
I bet that was a sight to write down in any history books published after Medzio Diena.{nl}That's how Hitomiko was able to deal with the Divine Spirits near Princess Kaonilla.{nl}
That wasn't all though.{nl}The Princess lost consciousness right after the ritual.{nl}
The impressive performance hadn't ended though.{nl}Hitomiko remained calm as if she had expected this when nobody else had, and started moving towards the Princess.{nl}
Hitomiko approached the throne where Kaonilla was and took a close look.{nl}Then she slowly turned around to all that were watching and said the following.{nl}
There had been an evil Divine Spirit that had been possessing Princess Kaonilla...{nl}The evil Divine Spirit had gone to hide in the depths of the Princess' consciousness.{nl}
I think she was trying to express the situation in terms that the people of the Kingdom could understand.{nl}Anyways, the room became silent before erupting in outrage.{nl}
It was to be expected of course.{nl}It could've be interpreted as an attack on the Princess under the guise of performing a ritual to appease the Divine Spirits.{nl}
However, Hitomiko calmed the people in the room and started talking to the priests.{nl}She said that she required their help as well in order to rid the Princess of the Divine Spirit...{nl}
Hitomiko calmly told the priests what they needed to do.{nl}They took places near the throne where the Princess was sitting.{nl}After that... just imagine.{nl}
All of the priests gathered under the guidance of Hitomiko...{nl}Using their powers on one person!{nl}I don't think that any evil presence could withstand such a situation.{nl}
The Princess was able to regain consciousness.{nl}Even if she was a bit worn out.{nl}
Hitomiko's work was recognized and she was given similar prestiege as the priests.{nl}In this Kingdom at least.
My signature for the petition? You think I'd just give it to you? {nl}No. At least pay me for it or something...
I'm dizzy. Come back later.
Ah, you're the one Adrijus sent. {nl}I've obtained the diluting solution he ordered. {nl}Be careful not to break the glass.
If you understand, start trying to think of a way to revert this.{nl}This simply cannot be ignored.
This is my true identity.
Which of the Goddesses do you wish to learn about?
Goddess Vakarine is at the Demon Prison.{nl} Goddess Gabija is at the Mage Tower and Goddess Saule is at Septyni Glen...

Goddess Austeja is currently at Vernike Island.

Goddess Zemyna is staying at the Earth Tower.

Goddess Ausrine is said to be in such a far away and mysterious realm to answer us.

Urgh! Monsters! Look out!
I see you've heard about my predicament from my apprentices.
I am a sibling to the previous leader of the Astral Tower and was also once a member.{nl}I made the mistake of providing influential information to Ignas when he was trying to  take over the Tower.{nl}The other members of the Tower have never been the same to me ever since that mistake.
No matter how I tell them that it was a mistake, they refuse to listen.{nl}That's why I have decided to try and find Lydia Schaffen's Flechette to try and undo my wrongdoings.
I've come to this place as I am almost certain that her Flechette must be in Ziburynas Forest.{nl}My apprentices and I have been trying to look for the Flechette but there's been no progress.
Have you found it?{nl}So that's how the Flechette looks like.
I can't imagine the work you've had to go through to find it.
Vaivora's Koru is answering me.{nl}In a soothing voice...
It seems as if the Flechette is nearby.

I, Kadumel, from the line of King Zachariel raise this Epitaph in order to leave records of the victory over the rebellion that was put down on Year 464 of the Kingdom.
Year 1096 of our Kingdom, Priest Lintas and his colleagues who are upholding the will of Maven the Wise are only now correcting the wrong records and accurately describing the wrongdoings of the Royal family and shortcomings of heroes.{nl}We swear by the name of the Goddess that this is the truth and may we suffer for eternity should this not be the case.
The Fortress of the Land which was created by Ruklys in order to safeguard Goddess Laima's Revelation from the demons raised King Kadumel's suspicions and the civil war that resulted from that caused great damage to the Kingdom and the death of Ruklys.{nl}We would like to bring to light the fact that Ruklys had no other intentions than devout faith in the Goddess and that King Kadumel was also influenced by Eminent.
We announce that those who died as prisoners here as traitors were the victims of misunderstandings.{nl}We argue that we should not mistakenly judge their actions when their only fault was to follow the lead of the devout Ruklys.
The reason Ruklys was unable to tell the King about the Commandments of the Goddess was because the King was Kadumel.{nl}Even King Oluche who had been making wrong decisions remembered to ask the will of the Goddess and decided to step down and raise King Enael the Kind to the throne.{nl}All that read this monument should do well to remember that no good comes from infighting within the Kingdom and to view that as a great deed is even more foolish.
Pouch
You can see a pouch.{nl}You are curious to what is inside.
Rewritten Monument
Priest Lintas and his colleagues, who are upholding the will of Maven the Wise, rewrite the contents of the Monument.
{nl}We finally started to right the wrong on the Year 1096 of our Kingdom.{nl}We have corrected it to mention the wrongdoings of the Royal Family and shortcomings of heroes.
{nl}We swear by the name of the Goddess that all that is written here is the truth.{nl}May we suffer for eternity should that not be the case.
Monument
I, Kadumel, who resides over my people with the blessing of the Goddess raise this monument on the Year 464 of our Kingdom.
{nl}This is to mark the victory over the rebellion that was put down one year prior.
{nl}It also holds great meaning as this is where the remnants of the rebellion are to remain for their lives.
Priest Lintas and his colleagues rewrite the contents of the monument.
{nl}The Fortress of the Land was created in order to safeguard the Revelation of Goddess Laima from the demons.{nl}However, that raised the suspicions of King Kadumel.
{nl}The civil war that resulted from that small suspicion resulted in the death of Ruklys.{nl}We wish to prove that Ruklys had no other intentions than devout faith in the Goddess.
{nl}We would also like to mention that King Kadumel was also influenced by the evil tongue of Eminent.
{nl}Those that lay here have died as prisoners and traitors.{nl}However, we announce that they were the victims of misunderstandings.
{nl}They who are now resting in peace had no fault but that of following Ruklys...{nl}We argue that we must now properly judge their actions under a new light.
{nl}The misunderstandings against Ruklys could only worsen as Kadumel was king.
{nl}Even if King Oluche made many wrong decisions, he listened to the Goddess.{nl}As a result of the consultation, King Enael was able to rise to the throne.
{nl}All that read this must learn from the examples mentioned.{nl}There must not be another civil war and people must not beleive that such conflicts are proud deeds.
Priest Lintas suddenly seems to be acting a bit strange...
It seems as if Goddess Vakarine is at the Demon Prison.{nl}Goddess Gabija is at the Mage Tower, Goddess Saule at Septyni Glen...
{nl}Goddess Lada seems to be at Seir Rainforest.
{nl}They all seem to be in areas where demons often appear.
{nl}Uskis Arable Land is famous for it's bees.{nl}I've heard that Revelators are lured there though.
Goddess Austeja is said to be in Vernike Island, but I've never heard of that place before.
Goddess Jurate is on her boat and palace, the Kivotos.
Goddess Dalia is said to be at Tevhrin Stalactite Caves.{nl}Humans are forbidden from entering that place.
{nl}What type of place do you think the Fantasy Library is?{nl}I suppose there will be a lot of books but what else?
The secret location within the Great Woodlands?{nl}There are more places where I don't know about even if I did hear them from Vaivora's Koru.
Goddess Laima captured by Giltine... Why would she be keeping Goddess Laima?
Unlike the others, Goddess Ausrine is somewhere mysterious where Koru can't talk about.
We've learned about the whereabouts of the Goddesses, but most of the locations are unfamiliar.
Sage Baseline
The underlying power of the Sage is magic.{nl}However, in order for that magic to actually be applied, a Sage requires two more things.{nl}One is the ability to focus magic on one location, and the other is a baseline on which to focus the energy.
If any wizard has enough magic to control space, the tenacity and concentration to focus that magic, all he would require is this baseline.
Sages can't usually use specific objects or geometry to focus magic as they cannot balance the otherworldly space that the Sages usually borrow or connect to.
This is like tying a rope to a twig before casting it into the abyss.{nl}Therefore, any baseline a Sage uses must always maintain a certain capacity. This means that there are sever limitations on what can be used.
A highly trained Sage might be able to use the mountains or the sea, but those will be much to large for most Sages to utilize.
 In other words, they are more than usable, but the Sages do not have the capacity to fully realize their properties.{nl}As such, suprisingly, most Sages are recommended to use the stars.
There are problems when using the stars as well.{nl}There are issues when connecting the wizards to stars far away and also to stars that can't be seen.
In practicality however, Sages can easily utilize stars even if they aren't skilled if they select to rely on the power of the Goddess that controls that star.
As can be seen by this fact, Sages also rely on the Blessing of the Goddesses in order to use magic just like Pyromancers.
The Goddess' Abode of Mount Monderor Volume I
The Goddess' Abode disappeared during the rule of King Jeromel the 2nd.{nl}More than 300 years after the foundation of the Kingdom, there are still many Goddesses and enemies that we don't even know about. As such, they would not have had any clues to which Goddess erased her traces at that time.
What is surprising is that despite the Kingdom's borders growing, the only Abode we know about and can approach above ground is the one at Mount Monderor.
Apart from that one, there is no history of a Goddess selecting a place for her abode that is accessible by humans.
It has been debated amongst many priests and scholars about whether the place at Mount Monderor was actually used by a Goddess.{nl}The decision was made by those that know best about the Goddesses, so I should be irrefutable.
Of course, the easiest way to reach the truth is for priests to ask their Goddess about their sister that lived at Mount Monderor.
However, as you might well be aware, the majority of prayers are focused on the well being of humanity and knowledge, not idle curiosity.
I consider it to be similar to why asking the Goddesses about our neighbor's private life is futile since it will never be answered.
Book of the Void
The book you are looking at is a literal wealth of information.{nl}However, there is not much information you will be able to gain from it other than the fact that you cannot learn from this book by reading it.
To be more precise, this book is a medium in which knowledge is stored in an otherworldly place and transfered to the Sage Master. As such, only the Sage Masters will ever be able to learn the knowledge being provided by this book.
If the person reading this book is currently walking the path of a wizard, we hope that you will return it to it's rightful owner.{nl}This book exists for only a certain moment and returns to a normal book after the next Sage Master learns from it.
Before or after that particular moment, this book may exist, but it will not have any particular meaning.
 New Inquisitor's Creed and Decree
We Inquisitors have prided ourselves to not have ever been lax in our duties even when the Goddess' were announcing their presence to you on a daily basis.
The duty of the Inquisitors has always been a heavy one as we cannot forgive those that imply that they are one with the Goddesses and have reached their authority.
Historically, the role of the Inquisitors have been about judging and settling petty disputes that arise between people due to the differences in how they view the Goddess' Blessing and not about the interactions between Goddess and human.
However, the horrid Medzio Diena occurred while I was Master and the Goddesses have disappeared making our responsibility even more important.{nl}The duty of recording and auditing the teachings of the Goddesses has become even more important after the confusion and destruction of Medzio Diena.
We have come to a state in which we now must make decisions ourselves when we had not needed to do so when the Goddesses were interacting with us.
I, the Inquisitor Master, am more overwhelmed than enthusiastic about this sudden increase in authority and reach.{nl}Even so, I shall gladly embrace these newly bestowed responsibilities and order all other Inquisitors to do the same.
This is the difference between our responsibilities and those of other priests in this era without the Goddesses post Medzio Diena.
We must prevent any discord between those of the cloth whether it be internal or external and this is the only way we will be able to stand in front of the Goddesses and humbly offer our achievements.{nl}Year 1096 of our Kingdom{nl}Inquisitor Master - Thomas Iquinostasys
Jane, who was the apprentice of Agailla Flurry, was unable to use magic.{nl}That's why she started research on how people like herself could use magic as well.
{nl}Wizards that followed in her footsteps invented Enchant Magic.{nl}It's a new branch of magic where wizards use their powers to give or extract magic from objects.
Allowing people that are unable to use magic to use magic is still a very difficult taks.{nl}That doesn't mean that we are going to give up on it.
{nl}We Enchanters are still tirelessly looking for better ways to do so through our research.
Every night, I dream of running away from a rampaging tree.{nl}I'm just watching as my husband runs to save other people.
{nl}Every time I try to stop him, I wake up.{nl}I wish I could at least stop him from going in my dreams...
I'm just thankful that Liel grew up to be such a bright and cheerful person.
You have told Curtis about the news.
What's going on? Let's finish what we've been asked first.
Beyond Pilgrim's Way is the Great Cathedral, which was built by Maven. {nl}Ruklys, Lydia Schaffen, and Agailla Flurry were all his disciples.{nl}
The Great Cathedral was significantly damaged on Medzio Diena, so I wonder if people {nl}still go there. Back then, a great number of people would go there to do various rituals.
The base forms of all things are water, earth, wind, and fire, {nl}and these are controlled by the goddesses.
Goddess.{nl}As the commander that leads the knights, I hope I can protect Klaipeda myself.
Highlander Master {nl}[Douglas Black] {nl}An experienced general from the noble class who was in charge of the Royal Guards. {nl}As the leader of Highlanders, he worked up front, saving the world from chaos.
Written by Lucid Winterspoon on Year 1096 of our Kingdom{nl}I have labored long as the Chronomancer Master, but my mission has been even more complicated after Medzio Diena, 4 years ago.{nl}
At first, I thought of the changes in Nheto Forest as a side effect of Medzio Diena just like the other regions.{nl}However, I have always been alert as to the possibility of using Chronomancy illegally and started searching since I felt some irregularities.{nl}I found surprising results as a result of my research, even when I was expecting some time shifts.{nl}I found that there had been considerable damage done to the time frame as well as vegetation as a result of Medzio Diena.{nl}I am worried that there may be those trying to take advantage of these issues, especially the demons.
However, finding the irregularities in Nheto Forest will become my short term mission.{nl}All I can do is to focus on my work about finding the issues and looking for a solution even if it may be too late to stop the side effects plaguing the region.{nl}
Recent findings by the Vaivora have been alarming historians.{nl}There had always been a sort of unspoken consensus on the fact that Ruklys was innocent, unlike what is believed by the masses, by those who knew all the facts about the incident.{nl}However, we can see from the documents that this can now be confirmed.
{nl}The documents contain the following contents.{nl}The Fortress of the Land which was built by Ruklys had been authorized through official routes and the seal of King Kadumel had been found on the orders to utilize soldiers and materials for it's construction.{nl}The Vaivora, mages and historians have verified the seal and all the documents to be real. This means the theory that Premier Eminent had played the two main characters against each other has been proven to be true.
{nl}As the truth has been revealed, we feel that it is only right that the heroes are recognized once more and that the misconceptions spread among the masses should be altered.{nl}Even if you take into account that the aftermath of Medzio Diena is still being felt.{nl}Written by Pyromancer Master Abreh Melinn on Year 1096 of our Kingdom.
Welcoming Speech
An illusion of the past has appeared.
You have found an illusion of Agailla Flurry.
Agailla Flurry's illusion{nl}is doing something.
There was no reaction
The last guest has yet to arrive.{nl}We shall start as soon as he arrives.
{nl}Have you managed to get all of your equipment and potions?{nl}Please let me know when you have prepared.
Only the Goddesses and Kupoles are to be invited here.{nl}We must quickly and quietly accomplish what Goddess Laima wishes.
{nl}That's why we must be fully prepared before we embark.{nl}Please let me know when you are prepared.
Very well.{nl}Just in time for our last guest.
This will require attention to detail even if it is quite simple.{nl}First of all, we must find a book.{nl}This is, of course, in order for as to meet a very special person that is looking for it.
{nl}After we find the book, we will take it to him.{nl}We will encounter difficulties when we get there.
{nl}You must protect me when we get there.{nl}That is about it.
The book cannot be acquired in the mortal world.{nl}This place has records of everything within this realm.{nl}Even about things we are not meant to know.
{nl}You will know if the plan succeeds.{nl}Please hold your curiosity for a moment.
This is who will lead us.{nl}He has his own problems and is being forced to help us.{nl}You may feel a bit threatened by his presence.
{nl}However, please refrain from any violent behavior towards him as he is also my guest.{nl}He is the key that will allow us to succeed on this endeavor.
Goddess Laima had prophesied about the dangers that will come to bear.{nl}What we must do here is to prepare for those dangers and look to overcome it through various means.
{nl}What we do here must not be known by the people of the mortal world.{nl}Even the decendents must not know about it.
{nl}All of you as well as myself will have to put our lives on the line here.{nl}I am sorry that I cannot let you know more even when I am asking so much of you.{nl}My apologies.
Please wait one moment.
All the preparations have been finished.{nl}We will be called upon soon.
Our final test is approaching.{nl}Are you all prepared?
Very well.{nl}Please do not be alarmed no matter what you see.{nl}Prepare to forget it if we manage to make it back alive.
They will call us soon.{nl}However, they probably won't have the faintest idea that we're here.
{nl}We'll be able to make it out if the situation is tense enough when our plan succeeds.{nl}Don't worry.
Alembique Cave Memo
Everyone might think that I'm crazy, but I swear I saw it!{nl}That huge mouth swallowing Bember!
{nl}At first, the small ones swarmed and bit it...{nl}Then the big thing appeared and swallowed it whole!
Records of Test Subject Number 285(1)
{nl}This test subject was captured near the center of the continent from a forest full of mammals.
{nl}It is a remarkable specimen that can survive for months on end with only a very limited food supply.{nl}We are thinking of making it into a monster that can survive without eating anything.
Recently gathered the members in a hurry.
{nl}Beggars and vagrants... Even some former soldiers...{nl}Those that are suffering from debt...
{nl}I got this contract before any other adventurers or treasure hunters, but I was still a bit nervous.
{nl}This was all because of what I heard from the right hand man of my western employer, the Oracle...{nl}
There will be many losses.
{nl}She had given me an extremely forboding prophecy.{nl}That's why I gathered those that would be injured or killed in my place.
Records of Test Subject Number 285(2)
{nl}The fact that the lords do not trust us non-demon followers is a given.{nl}However, they will change their minds when they see this subject.
{nl}I think we have succeeded in taming the subject since there has been no incident even after we starved it for more than a month.{nl}We've been capturing people and putting them near it, and the screams didn't stop for more than a while.
{nl}However, it soon became calm and has remained so for a few weeks.{nl}That's why we started using the villagers for other tests.
Records of Test Subject Number 285(3)
{nl}There was an accident yesterday.{nl}A researcher had gone missing and all we could find was his remains.
{nl}We thought that there had been an intruder but soon found that test subject 285 had disappeared from it's cage.{nl}It had dug a hole and vanished!{nl}
We are looking for it.
Records of Test Subject Number 285(4)
{nl}This may be my final entry.{nl}We've requested help from our lords but they looked down upon us as insects.
{nl}This creation that was made by our magic ate and dragged our brothers under the ground.{nl}Even those that were bred to protect us were no match for it,
{nl}If it's larvae are the same...It will not be any use even if we defeat test subject 285.{nl}It is only a matter of time before this place becomes it's lair...
{nl}All surfaces that we can step on is it's playground and we are merely it's playthings.
{nl}We are detected even if we move just a bit.{nl}Who will save us who have forsaken the Goddesses...
Former Fantasy Library : Sausis Room 9
Former Fantasy Library : Sausis Room 9, only you and your party members will be able to enter together.{nl}Do you wish to enter?{nl}(Recommended Level:315)
Earth Tower Solmiki Area (Recommended Lv: 310) {nl}Only you and your party members can enter together. {nl}Are you sure you want to enter?
Of course it is impossible to press down both footrests alone. {nl}You can use the wood chunks the demons scattered around... or ask colleagues for help. 
I've changed the name on this certificate for you so return the rest of documents to me. {nl}I guarantee either his assets or his land document. {nl}Please pay me the deposit as you did last time.
You will help Melchioras then.{nl}As far as I can tell it's time for us to act separately.
Let's check the documents after opening the chest.
I had never thought of opening it since I had orders from the Prime Minister.{nl}If it holds such important documents, it should be locked.
{nl}Even Hayatin's officer who brought the chest over didn't seem to know anything about it.{nl}I suppose we will have to ask Hayatin himself on how to open it.
Hayatin...It's been a while.{nl}I have come here despite being the person who took your life.
{nl}I have learned the truth about Ruklys.{nl}He had been framed and I was also given misinformation as a soldier of the Kingdom.
{nl}I pride myself in doing my duty as a soldier and being loyal to the Kingdom.{nl}Therefore, I do not believe that I did anything wrong.
{nl}However, I do believe that I owe you an apology.{nl}Ruklys and yourself were the people who kept resisting lies to the end.
{nl}I do not deny that I have some part in your deaths.{nl}Do you believe that I can be forgiven?
What is there to forgive.{nl}That was already a few hundred years ago...
{nl}You were a soldier merely following order.{nl}I would have done the same if I had been in your position.
{nl}I simply wish to let the world know about Ruklys and his innocence.{nl}I am thankful that you had a part in finding the documents.
I am grateful that you feel that way.
{nl}All truths must be fully disclosed.{nl}I wish the world will reevaluate Ruklys and his deeds.
{nl}I believe that it is time to say goodbye.{nl}I hope you don't mind me leaving first.
Victoras must not be the only one to learn of these facts.{nl}We must let the world know about the innocence of Ruklys.
{nl}However, I have been gone from the world too long.{nl}So I ask of you to find a way to effectively let the people know about these facts.
Mysterious Hunter
Are you a refugee?{nl}I'm sure you've seen the warning notice out front...
{nl}You'd better turn back if you value your life.
I warned you...{nl}Hey, wake up!
I told you it was dangerous.{nl}Don't you value your life?
{nl}Or have you come after me?{nl}If so, I don't care if you're a demon or from the Astral Tower. You'd better be prepared.
What?{nl}I'm chasing people away by taming beasts?
{nl}I did stop people from approaching but...{nl}There seems to be an unreasonable rumor going around among the refugees.
{nl}...So?{nl}Would you believe me if I told you that I've been chasing people away to protect them from the beast?
{nl}I'm going to return to my hideout.{nl}You can follow me if you don't believe me.
{nl}I'm warning you though... The monsters here are extremely violent.{nl}Take care of yourself.
The arrow would have hit if it wasn't for the curse...{nl}It went towards Absuptas Plateau! We should follow before it gets away any further!
This was unexpected...{nl}I've been wounded by it's attack...
{nl}I wouldn't have made such a mistake if my eyes were okay...{nl}We should find a place to hide over there...
How stupid do you have to be!{nl}I told you many times!
{nl}I have papers from the Kingdom recognizing my ownership of this land!{nl}How can this land be yours?
You not a lord or a noble. I don't care what you say.{nl}I don't even wish to speak to them so you take care of them Roberta.
Representative...of Lord Ryudhas...{nl}We have already found relics and monuments with our family's seal on them.
{nl}What do you think the people will believe when they see such evidence?{nl}I am certain that you will make the correct decision.
Hmph...{nl}I thought of forcing myself to talk to you, but it seems as if that won't get me anywhere.
Is it you...Good timing.{nl}I can't seem to talk amicably with these people. It was expected of course.
{nl}Have you not seen evidence that this is my land while working for me?{nl}Please let these dimwits know about the truth.
What are you talking about? He has seen solid evidence with his two eyes.{nl}It isn't possible to talk everyone to your side.
{nl}I guess you cannot be reasoned with. I have no other choice but to teach you a lesson through strength.
Save me!{nl}Monsters are attacking at Pastoghe Bend!
The refugees seem to be in trouble...
{nl}They are also my people.{nl}As their lord, I cannot ignore their troubles.
You must show them who the real lord is.{nl}As true owner of this land, you must be the one to help the people.
Boundary Notice
The following is the agreement between Lord Ryudhas's Representative and Lord Joquvas.
{nl}This notice declares that Lord Ryudhas shall rule the land right and above of this notification,{nl}Lord Joquvas will rule the lower left.
I will give you a note with what is written on the stone slate just in case.{nl}You'll be able to check what was written on it at any time.
{nl}You said that the light you last saw was...I think you said it was red?{nl}I think it may have something to do with what you said about it being the last light.
{nl}You said that the light you last saw was...I think you said it was blue?{nl}I think it may have something to do with what you said about it being the last light.
{nl}You said that the light you last saw was...I think you said it was yellow?{nl}I think it may have something to do with what you said about it being the last light.
{nl}You said that the light you last saw was...I think you said it was green?{nl}I think it may have something to do with what you said about it being the last light.
{nl}You said that the light you last saw was...I think you said it was purple?{nl}I think it may have something to do with what you said about it being the last light.
Indraja's note
Grasp the time at which you are granted audience with the King.{nl}The guardian will appear as the King looks down upon your last light.
Now let's try to make sense of this with the words written on the stone slate.{nl}It seems as if the King is signified by the statue in the center.
{nl}If so, do you think that the twelve pillars on either side represent when you meet the King?{nl}Does it mean that you should touch the pillars?
{nl}I think we'll have to activate the pillars and statue in the correct order.
There seems to be a switch within the pillar.{nl}Do you wish to activate it?
I was in the middle of activating this switch...{nl}Do you think I should move to another pillar?
It simply says that you must prove you are of royal blood to the guardian.
{nl}It seems as if simply touching it doesn't have an effect.{nl}We should take another look at the slate.
You have finally arrived at Taniel the Second's Royal Mausoleum!
{nl}I feel as if I am finally being rewarded for our efforts...{nl}I wouldn't have been able to come this far without your help.
{nl}I don't know how to repay you.{nl}I am sure that General Lamin will be pleased as well.
The Ashaq Underground Prison is the only remaining prison out of several built in the south part of King Kadumel's kingdom.{nl}Despite its connection to Ruklys Civil War and King Kadumel's tyranny, the building remains to this day as it was maintained through the years for various purposes other than a prison.{nl}
 I'll start repairing the Teleportation Magic Circle
You only seem to be able to notice the strangly shaped sculpture among the Kupoles.
You cannot seem to figure out where it is used.
You feel an energy that is sufficatingly evil.{nl}Try finding Kupoles first.
You feel as if holy power is embracing you.
Savior. It feels as if the protection magic has been removed.{nl}You should go and recieve it again before going on.
I will disarm the barrier.
That is...{nl}Siute must have been turned by darkness!
{nl}Just as I had worried...{nl}That's why there was no answer!{nl}
We should at least subdue Siute.{nl}Please stand back!
We can barely tie Siute down.{nl}Please gather the other Kupoles.
You have a feeling that it will be too late if you go and gather the other Kupoles.{nl}Could there be something you can do?
Now.{nl}Please use your energy!
Goddess Dalia
Ah... I feel the presence of Laima in you.{nl}Thank you, Savior.{nl}You have purified the darkness within me with your divine energy.
{nl}We don't have a lot of time.{nl}The carving on my arm is already emitting evil energies again...
This carving is Giltine's curse.{nl}I am getting evil energies that are in contrast to my own powers.
{nl}I cannot retain my conscious when Giltine's energy fills my body.{nl}I only destroy everything in front of me with the power of chaos.
{nl}This is why I had been held here...{nl}I am feeling the evil energies fill me once more.
{nl}Please go before I can't control myself.
600 years ago, a demon had cursed this city with petrification.{nl}The people here turned to stone, including their souls.
{nl}I tried to save the city.{nl}But the demon was adament.
{nl}He said that he didn't harm either the bodies or souls of the humans.{nl}Therefore, I shouldn't be able to interfere.
{nl}Neither a goddess or a demon is allowed to interfere with humans as long as they don't harm them...{nl}That was our deal.
The demons captured me and put the curse on me with Giltine's powers.{nl}I started destroying the forests after being consumed by the power of chaos.
{nl}Only the Demon Goddess is able to control the power of chaos.{nl}My sisters made another agreement with the Demon Kings.
{nl}We agreed to give up on the petrified city...{nl}In return for myself being sealed here by Gesti, Kartas and Baiga.
{nl}After sealing me here, they gave control of this cave to my sisters.{nl}The Kupoles have been guarding it ever since then.
It is unlikely that they would have hidden Dalia somewhere this obvious.
This seems to be a portal being used by the demons.
I'll infuse the divine energy from the Zolem Core after purifying it...{nl}Medena, please give me strength.
You demons!{nl}These are the demons that kidnapped Goddess Dalia!{nl}We will be able to pinpoint her location if we read their minds.
{nl}We can't know where District 5 is from the information we already have.{nl}I'll have to absorb their souls and read their minds that way.
{nl}Serija said that it is dangerous but...{nl}You can save me if I am consumed by darkness.{nl}We'll have to do our best before giving up.
He will soon arrive. Do not let the Kupole or Revelator enter District 5 before he arrives.
This world will be consumed by chaos when he arrives and frees the insane goddess.
I hope this will purify everything...
Dalia does not seem to be here.
A stronger force is blocking you. It is not possible to go further.
Ah... This... This feeling...
{nl}It was you...
{nl}Gesti...!
It's been a long time Dalia.
I can't believe that my minions weren't even capable of stopping maggots like these...{nl}I am embarrassed that I trusted those worthless minions.
{nl}Wait... You...
{nl}Ha, I never thought we'd be able to meet again so quickly.{nl}I hope you haven't forgotten what happened at Tenet Church?
I didn't know that we would meet here...
I was looking forward to getting my revenge for Tenet Church...
You wait right there you naive Revelator!
{nl}Dalia, I will free you.{nl}Go and destroy whatever you meet with the power of Giltine!
{nl}The Tree will become stronger with all that destruction.{nl}I shall give my life for that to happen!
Guardian Kupoles of the cave... {nl}Please answer my call...
How could this be!{nl}Has... has the curse been removed?{nl}This can't be...{nl}
Gesti.{nl}You shall kneel in front of the power of the Goddesses.
I... Do you think that I'll simply kneel before you?!
Savior... I shall focus all of my power into the Divine Orb.{nl}Please defend me from Gesti while I do so.
The Revelator was no match for me even though it wasn't for lack of trying...
{nl}Dalia, it seems that you've merely regained temporary consciousness.{nl}I will continue to bathe you in the Giltine's energy until you succumb!
{nl}I won't stop until you have lost all sense of self and are entirely consumed!
Gesti...{nl}Bow before the power of your owner.
Wh...What?!{nl}How can you use the powers of Giltine!
Kupoles...{nl}Go back to your locations.
This is my last order.{nl}Please honor it.
Thank you Medena.{nl}You have gone through much in order to protect me thus far.
{nl}You even managed to call a Savior...{nl}Laima must have forseen all of this.
Savior, I thank you.{nl}I was able to undo some of my previous wrongdoings thanks to your efforts in purifying the chaos that surrounded me.
{nl}However, this is not the end of the adventure.{nl}You are destined for much greater deeds than this in the future...
{nl}So please, leave Gesti to me.
Just listen to you talking nonsense.
Gesti...Do you remember what you told me earlier...
{nl}You said that you would gladly give your life...
{nl}All preparations are complete.{nl}You shall die with me here.
It seems as if the demons are growing even more violent.
I hope the Goddess is still safe...{nl}I really do...
I can't believe that the Kupoles have become so weakened...
Even Serija has been captured by the demons...
I do at least feel a bit better now that I have seen her.
We have finally arrived at the place where Goddess Dalia is.{nl}I hope she is okay...
Even the Kupoles have trouble meeting Dalia without protection magic.
The demons have kidnapped Goddess Dalia!{nl}I saw them with my own two eyes!{nl}There were three of them!
Serija... She is wounded...{nl}We need to find her!{nl}
Goddess Dalia seems to have regained consciousness... I haven't seen her like this for a long time...
It sounds like the screams of Serija!{nl}Something must have happened!
Please tell me as soon as you are prepared.
Leave the lower levels to the Tala Tribe.
Now, the day of total destruction will come upon us.
We demons will free the goddess from her seal.
We shall take the goddess.
You must not allow humans or Kupoles to come to District 5 where the goddess is.
This voice... Medena... it's Medena.{nl}Are you nearby?
Savior...{nl}Savior, I have a favor to ask of you.{nl}This will most likely become my last request...
{nl}Please lead the Kupoles as far away from the Tevhrin Stalactite Cave as you can...{nl}There is not much time left.{nl}I will lose consciousness soon...
Soon, a great evil will arrive at the Tevhrin Stalactite Cave.{nl}Considering the strength of the energy... Kartas... or Gesti...
{nl}Whomever it may be, one of the demon lords are coming towards Tevhrin Stalactite Cave.{nl}I will soon be consumed by the power of chaos at this rate.
{nl}Then they will free me from the seal.{nl}What happens next will be... death and destruction...
{nl}So please... Go as far away as possible.{nl}Far enough away so that I will not be able to find you...
Ah... That...
{nl}Saule... an divine orb with Saule's powers...{nl}Perhaps that will be good enough...
{nl}If I can use my powers along with the divine orb with Saule's powers, I will be able to face the Demon Kings.{nl}However, I will have to maintain consciousness while resisting the power of chaos.
{nl}The curse is solidifying it's grasp on me once more.{nl}The many evil statues that the demons installed here and there while I was kidnapped...
{nl}They are adding even more energy to the power of the curse.{nl}I will prepare for the battle with the Demon Kings.
{nl}So please destroy the statues for me.{nl}This will allow me to be able to resist the power of chaos until I fight the Demon Kings...
The monsters here will have seen the demons hide the goddess.
I thought so... The Tala Tribe knew about the whereabouts of the goddess.
The Demon Kings... Do you think we'll have the power to face them?
Divine power this strong...{nl}It isn't any weaker than the energy of the Demon Kings I felt earlier!
There is no time to lose.{nl}The magical core should be enough to open the road.{nl}Let's go!{nl}
Goddess Dalia... Do you hear me?
Do you think this will end with my death?{nl}That is pathetic.
{nl}Kartas will tear your souls apart.{nl}You will regret not dying at my hands!
It's lucky that we at least found the demon's portal now.
The road has opened!{nl}Let's go to District 2 of Tevhrin Stalactite Cave!
Revelator...{nl}You and I have such a long and tenuous relationship!
{nl}I will end you for good this time!
Only a soul remains shining where Dalia stood.
Savior, you will save Dalia and Tevhrin Stalactite Cave.{nl}Just like Dalia's prophecy.
Good luck.
Who are you?{nl}
Do you have business here?
You cannot seem to find Lina.{nl}It seems as if she has gone to install supplements elsewhere.
You should try organizing what you have heard.
What are your thoughts on the leaves you've seen?{nl}
You think that it was balanced due to the struggle between the two of us?{nl}
I had never thought about that...
Balance...{nl}That makes sense.{nl}
Although I did ruin Lina's work, I never stopped her from doing anything.{nl}I always interrupted her work after she started it.{nl}
Maybe it was just the right timing to stop anything from dying?
I thought that we were causing trouble for the refugees.{nl}Whatever the case, we fought in front of the humans even when we should have been adhering to the will of the Goddesses.
{nl}However, I thought that protecting the forest was the way to protect the refugees here.
There doesn't seem to be anything special about the leaves even if their colors are quite vibrant.
You cannot see the growth rings outside of the stump.
You have already checked this stump.
What happened to the forest...{nl}I'm glad that the vegetation isn't overgrowing anymore but...
I am worried since there are less herbs for us to use...{nl}There are herbs that can only be gathered during autum, but each herb has it's own use.
Of course, it's beneficial in the short term since we have more wood to fell.{nl}However, there will be no more trees at this rate.{nl}
Trees don't grow during autum you see.
I wonder when I'll be able to get the report I requested...{nl}I have to report to the Chronomancer Master after reading it.
Thank you so much for helping.{nl}I was able to finish the experiments much faster thanks to your help.{nl}
Now I will be able to help the Chronomancer Master find a solution to solve this region's problems.
There doesn't seem to be anything here
It seems that you have collected another page.{nl}This... You seem to be able to make out what is written on it. Take it to Kostas?
The leaves aren't falling even when the trees are shaking.
Here, take this.{nl}I was able to finish it quickly thanks to your help.
You'll be able to find nearby objects with divine energy by using this.
What was on the written orders?
What happened to the investigation?{nl}We have to find it before the demons do...
I see you've safely retrieved the third clue!{nl}Thank you!{nl}
Did you say that you've managed to get the new orders??{nl}Let's see...{nl}
I think it's only a bit different from the previous one.{nl}It says that it should be retrieved from Diena instead of Gesti.{nl}
What do you think happened? The orders to retrieve them from different demons...
Are you saying that they are having an arguement between themselves?{nl}A demon that has issues with Gesti...{nl}
Demon lord Diena is one of the four commanders of Gesti.{nl}I can't believe that she'd argue with Gesti...{nl}
What do you think could have happened?{nl}Do you think this has anything to do with it?
Diena
You...?
{nl}Ah, you must be the Revelator that has been interrupting our work here.{nl}I trust you'll understand if I don't wish to greet you.
{nl}If you are trying to find traces of Ausrine here, you're too late.{nl}Where are the traces that you've taken?{nl}
I... I need them.{nl}Hand them over.
Me?{nl}What am I doing here?
{nl}You...{nl}The Revelator?
{nl}Ah... I remember a little now.{nl}I was born a fairy and lived protecting humans...
{nl}The last memory as a fairy was of Gesti appearing in front of me before Medzio Diena.{nl}I became a Demon Lord and... I wish that I had no recollection... 
{nl}There must have been a trace of my old self within me...{nl}Maybe this was Gesti's curse...
{nl}I wanted to go back to my life as a fairy...{nl}I required the power of Ausrine to do that...
{nl}That's why I tried to gather all of the traces before they went into Gesti's hands...{nl}However, I shall give you these traces.
{nl}Somebody is coming.{nl}Take these while I have a bit of my former self.
{nl}I do not require them any more...
Ugh, you again.{nl}I want to start attacking you at once when I think of our last meeting...{nl}
But I've come to do some cleaning up you see.{nl}I wont forget what I've suffered at Zachariel's Royal Mausoleum.{nl}
You shall die to my powers one day.
I've told Deadborn as well, but bring the traces to me before sending them to Gesti.
Who is the commander here?{nl}I told you to bring them to me.{nl}
I won't say this again.{nl}I am ordering you to bring the traces to me.
Dullahan, I seem to recall giving you orders to bring Ausrine's traces to me.
This is my final warning.{nl}Hand over the traces.
There is only an orb without any trace of the messenger.{nl}What could have happened to him?
Do you wish to use the raft?
The orb is blinking faintly.
The orb is shining.
Castle Dungeon Test
Castle Dungeon (Recommended Lv : 290){nl}Only you and your party members can enter together.{nl}Do you want to enter?
This is from before there was a large statue in Fedimian.{nl}Of course, there was a small statue even then.
In any case, the fact that one could lose money by dropping it on Fedimian soil {nl}has made Fedimians very careful in handling their money.
 Modestas admitted defeat and said he'd pay him pay back. As he was leaving the place with wagon in tow, the old alchemist broke into a strange smile that caught Modestas' attention.
 Unbelievably, the piece of lead turned into gold in front of Modestas after a flash of suspicious light. 
 Modestas knew these gambles were more than just about money. {nl}Modestas, a dedicated gambler, nodded along with the woman's words. He clearly looked to be a man with a huge burden, his facial expression dark. {nl}The old woman could sense Modestas' thoughts, so she made this proposal.
[Since you seem to be worrying about how to move this boulder, what about this?{nl}I usually don't change the deal, but I'll make a special offer to add some fun.{nl}How about seeing if I can move this boulder on to your cart?{nl}You'll be able to receive help moving the boulder even if you lose the bet.]{nl}Modestas nodded in agreement since the deal seemed fair.{nl}However, the old woman started talking as soon as she saw him nod.
When Modestas asked about the condition, the old woman answered.{nl}'You are to take the boulder, which I will load onto the wagon, to Klaipeda. Then, turn it into an object of value which everyone will recognize and esteem. If you are successful, then the punishment for losing the bet against me will become void. Your friends will not disappear. Although this is difficult, I will still give you one more chance since you've already lost the bet. How about it?'{nl}Like always, Modestas had no choice.
The moment Modestas agreed to the proposal, the old woman pointed her finger past him. {nl}Modestas turned around and to his surprise, the boulder he had trouble with was effortlessly placed on the wagon. By the time Modestas looked forward again, the old woman had already disappeared. {nl}
Because Modestas had no ropes or equipment to secure the boulder onto the wagon, he had to lean the wagon and carefully drive it to Klaipeda. {nl}On his way to Klaipeda, he again met the soldiers who he had earlier bet against. Their commanding officer was now aware of what had happened thus far, and wanted to apologize to Modestas for getting him caught up and hurt in his subordinates' affairs. {nl}
The officer offered him help as soon as he heard that Modestas would be moving the boulder to Klaipeda.{nl}The officer and his men secured the boulder with strong ropes to prevent it from falling off and said that he would accompany him to Klaipeda.{nl}Modestas thanked the soldiers and accepted their offer. 
Modestas met the alchemist on the way to Klaipeda.{nl}He gave the gold bar since a promise was a promise.{nl}The alchemist started talking to Modestas as he seemed surprised by the fact that Modestas gave the gold bar without any resistance.
Everyone listened to them talking since they where curious about the bet.{nl}That's how they started talking about how they got involved with Modestas. The alchemist became sorry for fooling Modestas.
That's why he told Modestas that he would make arrangements to help him when he got to Klaipeda.{nl}Modestas was able to take the boulder to the center of Klaipeda and set the boulder down in the Central Plaza.
Just as the boulder was set down by the soldiers, the alchemist came with someone.{nl}The person that came with the alchemist was the famous sculpture and Dievdirbys Tesla.{nl}The alchemest started talking.
[How about sculpting a Goddess Statue with this boulder in the center of Klaipeda. I think that everyone in Klaipeda will recognize it's value if the boulder becomes a Goddess Statue. If so, I think that the conditions between yourself and the old woman will be met.]{nl}Everyone there agreed that this would be a good idea.
As news spread, everyone in Klaipeda was pleased to know a Goddess Statue was planned for their city. {nl}However, one last problem remained, asides from winning their favor. And that question was, which goddess should the statue commemorate? {nl}The soldiers who gave help transporting the boulder were especially passionate about this issue, and began quarrelling again. {nl}
The person to solve this problem was none other than Modestas.{nl}He thought that even if he didn't set out to do so, he should try to organize things as he was raising a Goddess Statue in the center of Klaipeda.{nl}He realized that the Goddess had appeared in front of him in the form of an old woman and tried to let the other people know of this fact.{nl}The people decided to believe Modestas and the Goddess Statue was allowed to be made.
When the Goddess Statue was finally complete, the people of Klaipeda were curious to see which Goddess would stand in the center of their beloved city.{nl}However, they were alarmed to see that they could not recognize who the Goddess was. 
The Dievdirbys who had sculpted the statue had already vanished deep into the Kateen Forest, so the citizens of Klaipeda repeatedly questioned Modestas for her name. {nl}Despite the numerous questions, nobody received an answer from Modestas. {nl}At any rate, this is the story of how the Goddess Statue of Klaipeda came to be. Even now that statue stands in the center of Klaipeda.{nl}
And so, some people believed Modestas, having undertaken the goddesses' intervention, was an honest man who did not gamble. In reality, Modestas didn't stop making gambles until his death. {nl}
Since that time, whenever Modestas took on a wager, he always bet the same thing. The answer to the question of who the Statue of Klaipeda honored.{nl}To uncover the name of the goddess, numerous people challenged Modestas to a bet.{nl}
However, Modestas didn't lose a bet even under the most dire circumstances. Therefore, many years passed without anyone learning the truth about the Goddess Statue.{nl}Modestas passed away undefeated, but never betting again after that incident.
People were finally able to learn that the Goddess Statue in Klaipeda was meant to be Goddess Ausrine.{nl}Goddess Ausrine took betting away from a man's life, but she also created a interesting mystery and a Goddess Statue in the middle of Klaipeda. 
A Certain Alchemic Record (I)
{s35}{nl}A Certain Alchemic Record (I){/}
 I write this, seeing so many people struggling with the path of an alchemist, to help those who will come after me shall learn the skill 'Magnum Opus.'{nl}First of all, transmuting one type of root into another. The instruction is as follows.{nl}{nl} 0 | 0 | 0 {nl} 0 | 0 {nl} 0 {nl}Following the instruction allows the user to transmute one type of root into another by placing it in the order. However, it does not apply to all types of roots.{/}
 Secondly, the transmutation of one type of shell into another. The process is slightly more complicated than the previous method. There are some that work well the other not so much.{nl}{nl} 0 | 0 | 0 {nl} 0 | x | 0 {nl} 0 | 0 | 0 {nl} Placing it in that order, it can transmute one type of shell into another.{/}
 The last procedure to be included in this part 1 is how to transmute one type of wing to another. The possibilities are wider than the previous two. Even I, the author of this book, cannot fully categorize them all. The procedure is like the following.{nl}{nl} 0 | x | x | 0 {nl} x | 0 | 0 {nl} 0 | x | x | 0 {nl}
 As a final word, I do believe that there will be some who are having difficulties understanding this text. It bears repeating. Place one type of item in the place marked  
with 0
 But not in the place marked X. This concludes the basics of Magnum Opus.
We were able to get here by defeating the demons in the Lolopanther Area.{nl}We will be able to go to the Solmiki Area without being hindered by the demons for a while.
However, we should not stop here.{nl}The demons will soon start attacking us.
I am certain that your courage and sacrifices will move the Goddesses' minds.
The Lolopanther and Solmiki Areas were named after animals that followed the Goddesses.{nl}I suppose it may be unfamiliar to humans that are not used to them.
The demons in the Solmiki Area are much more stronger.{nl}You will have to make preparations before we can go.
I had aided Goddess Zemyna before the demons took over the Earth Tower.{nl}However, I haven't been able to see the Goddess since then.{nl}I became weaker by the 
I became so weak that all I can do now is to ask for help.{nl}That's why I have been waiting for you while hiding from the demons.
You seem to be holding a seal from the demon leaders.{nl}I'll help you get through the Tower quickly if you give me that seal.
How dare you intrude the resting place of a Goddess.{nl}Who are you?
My most sincere apologies for leaving my place for so long.{nl}The demons that took over the Tower had been stopping me from returning.{nl}I would never have made it back if not for these people.
I beg of you, please do not cast them out...
Kupole Lhuta is talking about the world{nl}after Medzio Diena to Goddess Zemyna.
I was able to meet the Goddess thanks to you.
I would have perished if I had not met you.
I am planning on staying here with her.{nl}She needs me.
I shall send you to the Tower's entrance.{nl}May your returning journey be safe Revelator...
I am planning to stay near the Goddess and help her recover.{nl}There will be much I need to explain since the world has changed greatly.{nl}However, I am sure that she will go back to the world since she has seen your courage and sacrifice.
I am sure that there will be something you wish since you have endeavored to make it thus far.{nl}I cannot help you much, but I will be able to help you with your questions.
All life in the world is helping you maintain your lives and happiness.{nl}Even the small blades of grass that you step on.
All that grows on the earth is like a child to me.
The day called Medzio Diena was a shock to me as well.
All my sisters and my priests had prayed to me to help the humans.{nl}However, the plants are as precious to me as the lives of humans are.
That's why I had gone into the Earth Tower without making a decision.{nl}I had decided to close my eyes and ears.
However...{nl}After listening to Lhuta, it seems as if there is reason to rethink about your world.
Revelator...{nl}Thank you for helping Lhuta.
Please go back for the moment.{nl}Lhuta will send you back to the entrance.
I do not want to do this.{nl}Sister... Can you not understand me?{nl}Please rethink this...
Goddess Vaivora
You have harmed my Kupoles, destroyed my library and are now threatening me.
{nl}Giltine, what happened to the bright sister I knew?{nl}Do you think that you will win his favor by doing this?
{nl}Please stop at once!
I thought that you would do this.{nl}I am sorry, but I'll do what I want.
{nl}Theodora, I am sure that you will know what I am about to do since you're a Kupole of Vaivora.
Theodora, no!{nl}I am fine, please don't listen to Giltine!
What are you doing Vaivora...
{nl}Hauberk... I heard that you were going places with a human wizard, but how dare you interefere with my work!
Agailla Flurry, what is this?{nl}You have set me up!
I do not lie, Hauberk.
{nl}You didn't ask me.{nl}I am sure you'll be more careful when making deals with humans in the future.
{nl}Of course, that is if Giltine lets you live.
Giltine...! This is a scheme of the human!{nl}I did not betray you!
You shall be punished.{nl}Very painfully...
I suppose this conversation will have to wait.
I am sure that I will be too tired to face Vaivora if I have to deal with all of you as well.{nl}I'll send someone to play with you instead of myself.
Kill them all.
The rest of you should come with me.
Operator
The number of relics being traded increased after the surge of adventurers entering the Earth Tower.{nl}I heard that the collector was being overcome with work and came here.{nl}I'll trade you for anything valuable you bring me.
You seem to be an adventurous type.{nl}The Kedora Merchant Alliance is a group that follows the Goddesses.{nl}We don't do any shady deals.
These are from adventurers just like you.{nl}I hope that we'll be able to start trading with you as well.
I did a lot of trading with other smaller kingdoms before coming here.{nl}There are many monsters that have not been seen before there.{nl}I heard that I had to come here not too long after returning from that place.
I'm a bit tired since it hasn't been long since I got here.{nl}Let's talk some more later.
I'll be waiting here for you to return with a bag full of marvelous objects.

The Demon-Goddess Treaty
A long time ago, the Creator ordained unto us our duty, and a disharmony of opposing ideas emerged.{nl}Countless eras have since passed.{nl}
Among the many conflicts of opinions, none was as fervent as the one concerning humanity.{nl}Ignoring the differences between both sides is sure to lead to a war.{nl}
Thus, Ausrine and Giltine, representing each side of the conflict, have agreed to a peace treaty.{nl}Today, we enact here the pledge agreed to and signed by both parties.{nl}
We are beings born of the same roots.{nl}Yet, we have carried out our dispute for too long; this treaty is, sadly, the sole occasion in which we have reached an agreement.{nl}
Without it, we will find nothing but even greater misfortune, and so we have agreed to comply with the directions that follow.{nl}Ausrine and Giltine as representatives, as well as all our brothers and sisters, hereby vow to subscribe to this agreement.{nl}
We choose this, one of the paths where we first let humankind out from under the ground, as the venue of our pact.{nl}As we diverged most widely in our opinions on humanity, we find this to be an appropriate location.
With the enactment of this treaty, we aim for a cessation of our millennia-long dispute.{nl}Furthermore, we make known our wish for this to become the start of eternal peace. 
{nl}First, we shall refer to Giltine, as well as all her allies and subordinates as Giltine's faction.{nl}Ausrine, along with her goddess and Kupole following, shall be referred to as Ausrine's faction.{nl}
One. Giltine's faction shall not, under any circumstances, cause any harm to humankind.
Two. Giltine's faction shall not, under any circumstances, attack or cause any harm to Ausrine's faction.{nl}
Three. Unless they themselves or the lives of humans are under threat, Ausrine's faction shall not attack Giltine's faction.{nl}
Four. Both factions agree not to make known to humans neither this agreement nor the history of the world prior to it.{nl}
Five. Should any clause of this agreement be violated, the perpetrators shall be consumed by the Divine Tree, regardless of their position,{nl}as that is the sole means for each faction to permanently destroy the other.
Six. Excluding cases pertaining to article Five, neither faction shall, under any circumstances, attempt to destroy the other through the Divine Tree.
Prophecy Tome
Go find the treaty seal at the site where it is kept.
First you will need to disable the magic that's guarding the treaty seal.{nl}Find the light of the seal and make all the other lights stand out to dispel the magic.
Once all the lights are glowing in another color, you can disable the seal's protective magic.{nl}Use the power of fate on the treaty seal to disable the protective magic.
To obtain the demon treaty, you need an evil offering.{nl}Of course, I don't expect you to be carrying around any evil objects.{nl}It may not be the best option, but I believe you can get some evil energy from monster blood.{nl}First, hunt the monsters to collect their blood.
The Yudejan blood is not enough.{nl}You need more demon energy to have a truly evil offering.{nl}The demons left behind some red magic circles in Tamsorce Way.{nl}Take the offering and step on the magic circles to infuse it with their evil energy.
Only after the offering is complete can you obtain the demon treaty.{nl}The treaty is in Tamsus??keitimas.
The treaty was sealed by both demons and goddesses.{nl}If you have a token of the demon treaty, you can release the seal made by the demons.{nl}Use the token on the demon treaty seal to release it.
To obtain a token of the goddess treaty, you need the Goddess' Stone of Faith.{nl}I left the stone in Sviesos Way.{nl}However, according to my prophecy, the altar where I left it was destroyed during Medzio Diena.{nl}But it should still be in Sviesos Way.
Use the Stone of Faith to read the hidden writings carved on the seal.{nl}Speak the name of the goddess written on the seal to open it.{nl}The goddesses mentioned in the seal tombstone are Gabija, Vakarine and Zemyna.
Once you have the token, you can open the seal and obtain the key to the treaty.{nl}The key opens the box that contains the slate with the contents of the treaty.
If you have the key, now you need to find the slate with the treaty.{nl}Go to the Yudejan Altar and find the box that opens with the key; you'll find the treaty slate inside.
This area has been affected by a disease.{nl}Be careful on your way, and if you must pass by someone, please come to me.
{nl}- Plague Doctor Jugrinas
There is nothing written on the board.
Goddess Zemyna is always looking after us.{nl}My brother also says She is always protecting us.
{nl}Oh, you went to see the Statue of Goddess Gabija?{nl}Is She listening to our prayers?
The way I see it, we need to find the truth about our history no matter what.{nl}But I can't help thinking: what if the forgotten truths are more than the ones we know?
{nl}That's why I'm so glad Ruklys' name is finally clean.{nl}I assume you read the book I wrote?
{nl}I put it next to a book called History of the Rebellion; make sure to read it.{nl}Or you could read both books and compare them, that should be fun.
Oh, I dunno if you noticed, but it looks like there's this rumor going around.
No idea how it started.{nl}Everyone's all hush-hush, no one wants to talk to an outsider like me, I guess.
{nl}The way they're whispering though, I couldn't help but hear it even if I didn't want to.{nl}They're saying someone appeared and saved Orsha from some sort of danger.
{nl}I wonder if it was something like Medzio Diena?
You are very kind.{nl}I'm sure the person who saved the Bishop of Orsha not long ago was just as kind as you.
Oh, you're the Revelator.{nl}I've heard a lot about you.
{nl}She may not be able to tell you in person, but the Lord of Orsha is extremely grateful for all you've done.
You are always welcome to meet with the Lord directly.{nl}Even when she's out answering complaints, for smaller issues you always need to address the other officers, you see.
{nl}But you're welcome to speak to her about any problem if you wish.
Heard ya took care of Ebonypawn, huh?{nl}You did what I should've done myself... Guess I should thank you.
{nl}Then again, it's a bit of a letdown.{nl}Not trying to dismiss what you did, don't get me wrong.
Don't worry.{nl}We will make sure to hunt him down again.
Is that true?{nl}Oh... That's... unbelievable.
{nl}I suppose a Revelator would have no reason to lie...{nl}Alright. I should withdraw now.
{nl}That was an extraordinary feat you did, though.{nl}I was right not to doubt you since the first time we met.
{nl}Oh, I'll make sure to notify my subordinates.{nl}We need to pull ourselves together before we think about leaving.
Long time no see.{nl}What brings you back here?
Really? So the beast was looking for the entrance to the Royal Mausoleum?{nl}Who would've thought...
{nl}Anyways, glad to hear Syla Forest is doing alright too.{nl}I guess this was the plan of the goddess all long.
Barrel
The water in the barrel is tinted red. What now?
The energy is slowly being released... The stamina is weakening.
With the stamina weakening, it doesn't seem like it's going to get any worse.
After touching the water... some stamina was released!
It's probably wiser not to touch this.
Is this even okay to eat...? Well, too late.
Eat the Markazi flowers I gave you to relieve the pain.
Try and eat this.{nl}It will help ease the pain.
I'll take the rest of the flowers. I can give them to someone who needs them.
Rest in peace...
Are the owners of these graves with the goddess now?
May your spirits find eternal rest.
Are all the spirits here resting in peace?
The owls must have guided them to the goddess.
May you rest in peace with the goddess.
That's right. There are others besides the five goddesses.
I'm not sure about Goddess Dalia.{nl}She's supposed to be a goddess of fate and earth like Laima but...
{nl}She's trapped somewhere...
{nl}Hm?
{nl}Wait, what did I say?
She's like the Sun in the sky.{nl}If the sunlight is too strong or too weak we can't grow crops, you see.
{nl}So Goddess Saule is the one to please if you want a good harvest.{nl}Looking at the way the world has become these days, I would say Her power is not as strong anymore.
{nl}Oh, look at me rambling again...
Goddesses Austeja and Zemyna help with farming.{nl}When the season brings good crops and food is abundant, people also like to make mead offerings to Austeja.
Goddess Jurate... She's a little more difficult.{nl}From what I heard She's not very keen on helping humans.
{nl}Maybe that's why She's hiding...?
I don't know, no goddess comes to mind now.
No.{nl}I can't give you this apple.
{nl}But I'll give you the potato bread I was saving.{nl}It can be a little dry, so make sure to drink some water with it.
{nl}If you don't like it, give it to another hungry person.
That potato bread is going to go stale soon if no one eats it.{nl}With all the hungry people in the world...
{nl}I guess it's not enough food to share with the people coming back from destroyed cities.
My dad said they still had some food in Klaipeda.{nl}But if the refugees start gathering there, it won't be easy.
{nl}When will people finally be able to live happily and in peace?
Did you like the potato bread?
{nl}Actually potato dumplings are better.{nl}But my dad says the bread is dry so it holds for longer.
It's the end...{nl}There's no hope left...
I lost my daughter and wife during Medzio Diena... I don't want to live anymore but I'm hungry.{nl}How did I end up like this...
Potato bread... Yeah, I used to make a lot.{nl}I was trying to make dumplings but I failed every time, so they turned into hard bread instead.
{nl}My wife would always tease me about my potato bread.{nl}It was tough, but it tasted okay, she said... Our daughter and us, eating potato bread... We were happy then.
{nl}Those days will never be back now...{nl}That's what Medzio Diena did to us.{nl}It took away our dreams and our hope.
{nl}It's none of those goddess stories the higher-ups keep feeding us every time.{nl}To me, it was the day my hope, and my family, were lost.
{nl}This potato bread is dry like the one I used to make, but still tasty.{nl}Thank you.{nl}For making me forget about my empty stomach.{nl}
No one knows who built the big goddess statue in Fedimian, or how they did it.
Now that I think of it, Guard Jack must have been so bored.{nl}I could never cross to that side, you see.
You want to know what's over there?{nl}Nothing. Besides Guard Jack.
Uh? Does it like me?
Aww... that's cute.
Why are cats even cute?
I want to take it with me.
I beg your pardon?{nl}I couldn't hear you very well.
Thank you.{nl}No one has ever spoken to me in that way. I was just, shall I say, touched.
You ask too much of a simple guard...{nl}...
Should I send you to Jack over there instead?
Guard Dan sent you here from the other side?{nl}Well isn't he helpful...
{nl}As you can see, there's nothing here.{nl}And you're going to fall if you're not careful, so I suggest you get back down.
You really startled me there.{nl}No one's ever been able to climb up here for over a year.
{nl}I think that was around the time I was born...
{nl}Um, I mean, no, no.{nl}Never mind that, I was just rambling...
Goddess, Holy Laima!
Are you going back down?{nl}That's wise of you.
There's nothing here, not to mention how dangerous it is.
Merchant Running from the Petrifying Frost
To tell you the truth, I escaped from the Coastal Fortress.{nl}I don't know if you saw all the petrified people inside, but it was horrendous.
{nl}Seeing those people turned into stone... I was staring at them when suddenly the wind blew and it startled me.{nl}I felt it. It was the Petrifying Frost.
{nl}I started to run and ended up here.{nl}Oh, and now that I think of it, my things are gone...
Ugh, my legs.{nl}I was literally running for my life all the way here.
{nl}There's a murky kind of smoke chasing me. I'd heard about the Petrifying Frost, but I never knew just how scary...{nl}My legs are still shaking.
I'm too out of breath to even talk.{nl}But if I want to live, I have to get up again soon.
The people petrified at the Coastal Fortress all looked so daunting.{nl}Like there was something more to it...
{nl}I know they say the goddesses are gone, but why did They let those people end up like that?{nl}What kind of higher reason could there be...
The thing is, didn't they say this curse was because of that revolt 600 years ago?{nl}But I thought it was proven that it wasn't a revolt at all, wasn't it?
{nl}So why the curse...?{nl}Whose scheme was it...
{nl}They say it's hard to predict the future of our era, after the world was turned upside down 4 years ago.{nl}I just don't know.
Many people here were affected by the Petrifying Frost...{nl}Can they ever be saved?
Blueprints to the Royal Mausoleum.
Nothing can be made out from the text.{nl}The letters look like they were erased by someone.
And here...?
My body can't hold on for much longer.{nl}But maybe it's better that way.{nl}After this gruesome work is finished, anyone who managed to survive it will face nothing but inevitable death, and that is far worse than the fear of not making it to the end.
{nl}No one says anything but we all know it.{nl}Everyone working at this hellish construction, and anyone who enters it in the future, will never make it out of here alive.
Year XX, XX of XX.{nl}{nl}To Anne.{nl}I'm not sure it does any good to count the days since I last saw the Sun anymore.{nl}I don't know, I don't see any meaning in it.{nl}I'm going to die in here anyway.
{nl}Year XX, XX of XX.{nl}{nl}To Anne.{nl}Today was another day of carrying stones and piling them up.{nl}I wonder how the others ended up caged in here.{nl}But what difference does it make.{nl}My fate will be just the same as theirs.

Someone's Scribbles
HELP ME! I WANT TO LEAVE! I'M SO SCARED! HELP!
{nl}(Signs of having been scratched repeatedly)
This seems to be a type of diary.{nl}Read?
Prison Guard Note
Anyone who ends up here is miserable at first.{nl}This ought to be true 1000 years ago, and it will still be true 1000 years from now.{nl}Even if the world turns upside down.
But I don't really see that happening, to be honest.
{nl}In any case, everyone they bring here{nl}always makes a fuss at first.{nl}It's only when they're put in the punishment room that they really face up to reality.
{nl}Hm, who am I writing this note to, again?
Punishment Room Guard Note
People face up to their sins here.{nl}Even those with no sense of guilt start to feel it.{nl}{nl}Truth is, maybe some can escape punishment, but they can never escape guilt.
{nl}Before they're sent to the torture chamber, all they can do in this prison is endure the crushing weight of their excruciating guilt and regret.
Torture Chamber Guard Note
I have no sin.{nl}I have no fault.{nl}I merely do as I am told.{nl}I know the things I do to people can never be right.
{nl}I have no sins.{nl}I don't do this because I want to.
{nl}Hear me, goddess.{nl}When, oh when, will I be rescued from this guilt?
Offender Institution Guard Note
Does one's spirit become pure after punishment and torture?{nl}Does one have the right to convict another human?
{nl}I see people leaving this place with a pleasant expression on their faces, but I wonder if it's not because their spirits have left them.{nl}If the human spirit is inherently evil and it leaves the body, does it become pure?
Grave Keeper Journal
Those Necromancer lunatics sneaked in again.{nl}Foul things want to summon back the dead that have gone to the goddess.
{nl}It's insane.{nl}I can't let them get away with this anymore.{nl}Something must be done.
It's not just Necromancers that are sneaking in, but Bokors too.{nl}There was one Bokor sneaking in today.
{nl}I did manage to chase them away, but it's hard to tell how much evil energy they left behind.{nl}I need to find a way to keep them from coming here with bad intentions and clean up all the energy.
Today I went to a place near Klaipeda to find a way to clear out the bad energy.{nl}I heard the watchers there use a type of shaman doll to find and purify evil energies.
{nl}Fortunately the watchers taught me how to make a shaman doll.{nl}I want to start making one tomorrow.{nl}I'm also going to write down each step of the process.
My son was born.{nl}We named him Sigis.{nl}I never thought of my job as grave keeper as bad work, but I would like my son to work somewhere a little brighter.
{nl}I need to work harder to do well at my job and get healthy.{nl}If I suddenly die, my son is going to inherit my job so I better watch out!{nl}I love you, son!
I heard you took care of that Tree of Truth order that was here.{nl}I may be living in a hole but I do hear a few things here and there.
{nl}That was really impressive.
Oh... My dad's journal...{nl}It was here all along...
{nl}I'd been wanting to find it ever since I suddenly had to start working here 4 years ago.{nl}But with all that mess with the Tree of Truth and goddess relic, I didn't have time for anything.
{nl}I was so focused on the shaman doll... I missed the thing that was most important to me.{nl}Thanks.
You found my dad's journal, and you took care of everything for me.{nl}You really are something else, aren't you?
Can't believe someone would do something like this in the name of the goddess.{nl}This Tree of Truth deal just went too far.
{nl}For the sake of my dad who left me this place, I need to make sure those things never set foot here again.
Looks like my dad didn't exactly want me working here...{nl}Still, I'd say I'm doing pretty well!
{nl}Even with help, getting rid of the Tree of Truth order is a big deal!
I'm going to make the best shaman doll with the materials and the notes my dad left.{nl}Keep away those crazy Necromancers and those Bokor lunatics.
The grave keeper's box contains something that looks like a diary.{nl}Read?
Skulls
The skulls seem to have been arranged in a line.{nl}Have a look?
Nothing's wrong, but the atmosphere just turned dismal.
Nothing going on here.
Oh, right. I forgot.{nl}Some grave keeper was asking around about this magic doll.
{nl}I wish I could have helped but I gotta make do with what I have, and it ain't much.{nl}Sounds like he managed to make himself a doll after all.
Oh, but that grave keeper.{nl}I think he was asking Molly about the doll.
{nl}Ah, so the son of the grave keeper is doing the job now.
That's a very special object you have.{nl}Mind if I have a look?
They're called Eitbaras' Records.{nl}The quality of the binding leaves a lot to be desired, first of all.
{nl}I'm going to make them into a proper book. Would you mind if I borrow them?
Is he resting now?
Yes, Alan's spirit will have gone to the goddess.
I'm glad to be free of any resentment.
Now that Gaigalas is defeated, Alan's spirit must be at peace, too.
Willis' Spirit will also be with the goddess.
Now that Gaigalas is defeated, Willis' spirit must be at peace, too.
I hope Weiz' spirit will be with the goddess.
Now that Gaigalas is defeated, Weiz' spirit must be at peace, too.
Soldier's Diary
Our commander called me this afternoon.{nl}He handed me an envelope, tightly sealed.{nl}He said nothing.{nl}But I know.{nl}I know what I must do with this envelope.
{nl}I must do it before sunrise.{nl}I feel scared, a little.{nl}Can I ever go back to my family?
This won't do.{nl}How can anyone trick someone into becoming a sacrifice for the demons...
{nl}I understand there are no supplies and our lives were at risk, but still.{nl}I feel ashamed as a 
member of the army
, having to follow any orders coming from my superiors.
Adjutant General Dean, who our commander so much admired, was found dead.{nl}We assume he escaped last night. In the morning, we found his body in front of Ontra Cliffs... a horrendous sight.{nl}A sort of envelope was tied around his neck.{nl}The demons are giving us a bold warning, using him as an example.
{nl}There's nothing we can do. We're forced to obey them.{nl}In this condition, who would dare tell us that what we're doing is wrong?
We're in the process of getting material support to the troops at the Ibre Plateau.
{nl}In any case, this is incredible.{nl}The fact that they survived in such an arid, cold region.
{nl}Given the circumstances, they may very well have been tempted by the demons.{nl}Trying to escape would be suicide.
{nl}To think they survived through all of that...
Abandoned Journal
This looks like an abandoned journal.{nl}Read?
Dead End Goddess Statue
There's a Goddess Statue.{nl}Worship?
The Goddess Statue isn't working.{nl}Just like a road leading to a dead end...
This statue... what goddess is this?{nl}In this dead end of a road, it may not be working but its beautiful shapes remain.
Looking closer at the statue, there is something different written at the bottom.{nl}Read?
Transportation for Grave Robbers
{nl}This darned Gateway is blocking our way to the Royal Mausoleum.{nl}We can't just sit back and do nothing, can we?
{nl}So we made a few transportation devices you can use to get to places faster.{nl}
If you're not a grave robber, the devices can put you in the wrong place, though.{nl}Don't take it personally.
Leads to Pupule Vegetable Garden.
Entrance to the Underground Tunnel leading towards Shulioti Fallow Ground.
Entrance leading to Jabai Farmland.
Entrance to the Underground Tunnel leading towards Wind Vane Tower.
Entrance leading to Dokas Reservoir Port.

Entrance to the Underground Tunnel leading towards Tvirta Reservoir Embankment.
Leads to Shulioti Fallow Ground.
Leads to the left-hand lower side of Farm Goods Depository.
Fruit Basket
Have a bite?
Stamina reduced.
The fruits here cannot be normal. They reduce stamina instead of increasing it.
The mood turns sour as stamina is reduced.
Stamina is suddenly reduced.
They look so interesting though, it can't hurt to try, right?
Just one bite!
There's a fruit basket here.
Better not touch it, can't let curiosity get in the way.
Supposedly people aren't supposed to eat these fruits.
What happens if you eat them?
Where am I?
Entered Mage Tower 1F with Grita.
Tried to activate the defense barrier in 1F.
Was in the process of enhancing the Jewel of Prominence in 2F.
Grita said the Jewel of Prominence would give Goddess Gabija strength.
Mad magician Antares was waiting on 3F.
Antares was obsessed with the magic and perished in 3F.
After Antares died on 3F,  the consequences made it all the way to 4F.
Grita was incredibly helpful.
Met Gabija in 5F and received the Revelation.
Laima's Revelation was being kept by Gabija.
There's a telescope pointing somewhere.
First things first.
The telescope can wait until later.
Eveything is completely dark.
Can't see anything through the telescope.
There's no use in looking through it now.
Wooden Panel
There is a loose wooden panel.
You are in a wrong place.
Where is this place?
Oops, you slipped.
Pile of Dust
It's covered in dust.{nl}Give it a good sweep?
Fraying Paper
There is a piece of paper on the spot.{nl}It looks old and fragile. One wrong touch might crumble it to dust.
{nl}There is something written on it.{nl}It looks like a letter to someone.
As soon as you get there, please, check on the men sent there are doing their duties properly.{nl}Certain suspicions have arisen.
{nl}If, there are such men, utilize the monsters nearby to take care of them with extreme prejudice.{nl}Better safe than sorry.
{nl}I have already taken care of those who...
{nl}(The rest is illegible)
Wiped some dust off of it.
What could lie beneath the dust pile.
Dust or dirt...
There is something in it.
The letter to someone crumbles to dust just by reading it.
The letter has crumbled.
The paper seems far too fragile.
Tangled Vines
Vines tangle everywhere.
Better not cut it.
Well, no.
You've been bounced off of the place. It's rather unfortunate.
Close shave.
If it looks suspicious, leave it be.
You have no idea what it does, don't touch it.
Have you heard about flower branches?{nl}They look like deer antlers and the flowers that grow on them are beautiful.
I only heard about them, but I've never actually seen one.{nl}Everyone says they're exceptionally beautiful, so I want to see for myself.
Arghidas
Stop wasting time here and hurry on your way already.
{@ST43}Sentry Bailey{/}{nl}Constantly guarded by Royal Army guards.
{@ST43}Drill Ground of Confliction{/}{nl}Populated by a few soldiers caught in the petrification curse in the middle of their duty.
{@ST43}Resident Quarter{/}{nl}Home to the Barrier Crystal made by Premier Eminent. The crystal blocks any access to deeper parts of the Fortress of the Land. A certificate is required to get pass the crystal. The certificate can be made with the magic device in Leima Small Square using Dandel earth crystals and mushrooms obtained at the Resident Quarter.
{@ST43}Storage Quarter{/}{nl}Heavily populated with demons. Ruklys' Army spirits inhabit First Freight Station. Spirits are wary of outsiders and will attack if they feel threatened.
{@ST43}Fortress Battlegrounds{/}{nl}Heavy demon presence, same as the Storage Quarter. A few of Ruklys' defense devices are still spread throughout the area and active; possibly dangerous.
The report on the Sentry Bailey goes here.
The report on the Drill Ground of Confliction goes here.
The report on the Resident Quarter goes here.
The report on the Storage Quarter goes here.
The report on the Fortress of the Land goes here.
If you have no business with me, just leave.
How do you know that?
You look deep into thought.
Thank you for last time.{nl}I'm trying to hide my status, so just ignore me if you see me around.
Defeated the monsters while equipping no more than 1 piece of armor, as requested by the Murmillo Master.
Shall we give it a try?
In honor of those sacrificed for the demons' monstrous experiments...
The tools we use to make offerings are completely gone.
Those are our offering tools. Are you saying the ferrets had them?
First the ferrets steal our food, now our offering tools too...?
Here I am, led by my haphazard attempt to evade the incoming danger.{nl}Running from the enemy is no easy task. I'm thankful for these short writing breaks I can still afford. I'm going to try and lose my enemy at Bellai Forest and go looking for Yura Swanjone.
(Part of the paper is torn.) After I find the whereabouts of Yura Swanjone???￿Fedimian, I plan to escape to the Forest of Prayer, where humans are scarce.
The enemy I thought I had lost has just... (The letters are blurred and hard to make out.)
... I need to escape to the Dingofasil District. Going there means I'll be in danger, but so will my enemy. It won't be easy chasing me there. 
Those dogged creatures... They're as determined as ever in chasing me (The paper is torn.)
If I don't lose my enemies completely, Yura Swanjone too will be in danger. (Part of the paper is torn.)
Amanda's Tombstone
Fortress of the Land, the place of Ruklys' last act of resistance.{nl}Together, great thieves and adventurers entered the mysterious fortress that for centuries was impenetrable.{nl}There the demons conspiring to menace our world they defeated.
Justina lost her parents as a child, she must miss her family a lot.{nl}There isn't much we can do to help her.
So that's what Gailus Legwyn said...
The spirit seems to be eagerly looking for something.
Inmate Note
Hey. Derek... Do you remember?{nl}When we used to hide in the holes of dark, filthy Ashaq Underground and eat those chocolates, biscuits, apples, potatoes.
I remember eating chocolates at the Supply Room on the second floor, but I don't remember how many.{nl}I guess it'll come back to me if I go there.
Ah, that's right. We sat in the Supply Room eating a piece of chocolate.{nl}You said it tasted like wine poured by Goddess Zemyna Herself.
After we ate the chocolate, I said I wanted biscuits and you said that if I waited 3 weeks you'd give me biscuits, and you told me to wait by the Bird Room 3 weeks from then.
I was so excited to eat those biscuits I couldn't even sleep.{nl}Then 3 weeks later you and I finally ate the biscuits in the Bird Room.{nl}I'll never forget the taste of those biscuits.{nl}Do you remember how many biscuits we had?{nl}Hm... Should I go back to the Bird Room to remember...?
Ah, that's right. We sat in the Supply Room eating 2 pieces of chocolate.{nl}You said it tasted like wine poured by Goddess Zemyna Herself.
Ah, that's right. We sat in the Supply Room eating 3 pieces of chocolate.{nl}You said it tasted like wine poured by Goddess Zemyna Herself.
Ah, that's right. We sat in the Supply Room eating 4 pieces of chocolate.{nl}You said it tasted like wine poured by Goddess Zemyna Herself.
Ah, that's right. We sat in the Supply Room eating 5 pieces of chocolate.{nl}You said it tasted like wine poured by Goddess Zemyna Herself.
Ah, that's right. We sat in the Supply Room eating 6 pieces of chocolate.{nl}You said it tasted like wine poured by Goddess Zemyna Herself.
Ah, that's right. We sat in the Supply Room eating 7 pieces of chocolate.{nl}You said it tasted like wine poured by Goddess Zemyna Herself.
Ah, that's right. We sat in the Supply Room eating 8 pieces of chocolate.{nl}You said it tasted like wine poured by Goddess Zemyna Herself.
Ah, that's right. We sat in the Supply Room eating 9 pieces of chocolate.{nl}You said it tasted like wine poured by Goddess Zemyna Herself.
I remember now. Yeah, we had 1 biscuit then.{nl}We were dead scared the guards were gonna catch us.
Now that I think about us eating the biscuits in the Bird Room, it reminds me of the time we ate those apples at the Second Watchtower on 3F.{nl}We were caught by one of the guards and you bribed them with apples so we wouldn't be punished, remember? How many did we have exactly? Maybe I need to go back there to remember.
I remember now. Yeah, we had 2 biscuits then.{nl}We were dead scared the guards were gonna catch us.

I remember now. Yeah, we had 8 biscuits then.{nl}We were dead scared the guards were gonna catch us.
I remember now. Yeah, we had 9 biscuits then.{nl}We were dead scared the guards were gonna catch us.
Oh, I remember now. We had 1 apple then. If you think about it, all we did back then was eat stuff behind the guards' back. Remember when had those potatoes at the First Watchtower? We heard steps and just gulfed them down, afraid of being caught. It was so fast I don't even remember how many we had... I wonder if it'll come back to me if I go there.

Now I remember how we gobbled up that 1 potato without even drinking a drop of water. We choked so hard we had to bang on each other's backs until it went down.
A couple of days ago I got something I think you're gonna like. Don't you wanna know what it is? Come to the Felon Prison and you'll see.
Now I remember how we gobbled up those 2 potatoes without even drinking a drop of water. We choked so hard we had to bang on each other's backs until it went down.
Now I remember how we gobbled up those 3 potatoes without even drinking a drop of water. We choked so hard we had to bang on each other's backs until it went down.
Now I remember how we gobbled up those 4 potatoes without even drinking a drop of water. We choked so hard we had to bang on each other's backs until it went down.
Now I remember how we gobbled up those 5 potatoes without even drinking a drop of water. We choked so hard we had to bang on each other's backs until it went down.

Now I remember how we gobbled up those 9 potatoes without even drinking a drop of water. We choked so hard we had to bang on each other's backs until it went down.
There's something that looks like a note here.
Please tell the Inquisitor Master, so that no one else falls victim to the Order of the Tree of Truth.
Revelator Mihail's Review
Hearing about the Revelator's adventures, I couldn't help but be suspicious.{nl}From defeating Demon Lord Bramble and recovering the Revelation Slate kept by Goddess Saule,{nl}to the battle with Rexipher???痢쓘ide the tomb of King Zachariel;{nl}overthrowing Helgasercle with Grita and Goddess Gabija's Divine Tree,{nl}protecting the Revelation hidden by Maven from Demon Lord Naktis,{nl}revealing the true identity of Premier Eminent at the Fortress of the Land and defeating him,{nl}even defeating Demon Queen Gesti?????Tenet Church with the Paladin Master and the followers...
Every single story was simply unbelievable. I knew this Revelator was different from the others after the battle with Delmore Rephaim, but I had no idea of just how different.
Writings Carved on the Ring
May Dominic and I live together happily ever after.
Sometimes it's good to make some food for your companion, too.{nl}But yours is still young, so it's best to buy premade foods for it.
It's impossible to see the gigantic Statue of Goddess Zemyna in one complete view. {nl}Even after its lower half was buried underground after the huge earthquake.
How exactly did you get up here?
Take this necklace.{nl}So you, too, have been to Earth Tower...{nl}How was it?{nl}Some adventurers I talked to said they couldn't so much as set foot inside from all the powerful monsters.
The day adventurers stop going to Earth Tower out of fear...{nl}I'll have lost my reason to be here.
The necklace I gave you will make it a little easier for you to explore Earth Tower.{nl}Alright, I wish you good luck.{nl}May the goddess bless you.

If only they had paid attention to my warning...
They were an admirable person, it's a shame.
The box seems to have been sealed with magic.
Please deliver my reply to the Sage Master.{nl}I'll be very glad if someone decides to learn about nature after reading my story.
Well, the experiment failed, but thanks for helping.{nl}Make sure to deliver the reply to the Sage Master.
It looks like there is still more information about the crystal to be collected.
To what do I owe this pleasure?
Ah, you are looking for someone.
Herbalist Kalcis?
Sorry, doesn't ring a bell.
What is this world coming to...{nl}How can I help you?
Herbalist Kalcis?{nl}Never heard of that name til now.
Usually, herbalists are in Knidos Jungle or Dadan Jungle.
Is it me whom you wanted to see?
You are looking for Mister Kalcis, right?{nl}He retired from being a herbalist and went to Klaipeda along with his daughter, after the land purchase.
When Medzio Diena happened, he came back to Orsha alone.{nl}And resumed his herbalist career and went to Knidos Jungle. That was about two months ago.
[Month: xx Day:xx Year:xxxx]{nl}After long and hard days of thinking, I left Selphie in Klaipeda and came back to this place.{nl}This place ain't what it used to be. Now it is crawling with those darn monsters and demons.{nl}But I must gather up expensive herbs for my dear Selphie.{nl}
[Month: xx Day:xx Year:xxxx]{nl}I miss the time of having a farm with Selphie. It was short but sweet like no other.{nl}The money I paid to get that land...{nl}Have Goddesses forsaken us?{nl}

[Month: xx Day:xx Year:xxxx]{nl}Some strange looking wizard have been spotted 'round here.{nl}I saw him leading a bunch of monster to the monastery...{nl}What on earth is going on.{nl}Can't be distracted, in about a week from now, I can get that Arzeli.{nl}I got a little scratch from a monster.

Do you have any idea who I am?{nl}I am the GREAT Munchausen. The greatest problem-solver in the kingdom.
Just 4 years ago, I ate demons for rather pleasant afternoon tea-time treats. But nowadays, the time has not been kind to my body.{nl}But it matters naught! The great problem-solver like myself shall never bow down to Time itself!
Father is awfully late..{nl}When will he be back?{nl}
I keep writing letters to him but no reply.{nl}Oh could something happened to him?
Adventurer, I thank you.{nl}I will keep my father's diary and Arzeli safe.QUEST_20161221_005426

However, you can also build up your DEX and CON.{nl}DEX increases accuracy, evasion rate and critical rate.
{nl}Increasing CON means increased max HP and HP recovery.{nl}It is also good for block and critical resistance.{nl}
{nl}You'll need to think very careful about what path you will take.
{nl}However, you shouldn't forget SPR if you want to use mostly magic.{nl}It will increase your maximum SP and SP recovery so you can cast more skills.{nl}Choose carefully.{nl}
Having high STR is a must for an Archer class.{nl}STR increases your physical attack and critical attack.{nl}
{nl}But DEX is almost equally important. It increases hit probability, evasion rate and critical rate.{nl}Think careful about what path you will take.{nl}
INT is an essential stat for a Cleric class.{nl}INT increases magic attack.{nl}
{nl}But sometimes you may need some STR or SPR.
{nl}STR increases physical attack, critical attack and the amount of items you can carry.{nl}SPR is good for increasing your max SP and SP recovery.
{nl}You need to think very carefully about the path you'll be taking.{nl}

Weird, huh? Told ya it would go bad like that.{nl}Ah well. Gotta go and get more.
There's a pile of dirt, for some reason.
You got some nerve, talking me up like that. Want a seed?
You can go and plant it by the fences. Don't think it'll do much, but try.
The seed was planted, but nothing happened.{nl}Instead, the seed died.

This device was used for protection against demons.
The multiple devices spread throughout the area weren't enough to stop things from happening.
This device shows the boundaries between goddesses and demons.
There are several devices like this spread throughout Tevhrin Stalactite Cave.
Justas
Hm? What are those loose records you have there?{nl}Eitbaras...?{nl}That sounds familiar...
{nl}Anyway, if you keep carrying them around like that, they'll be hard to read later on when you need them.{nl}Let me have a look.
Isn't it much better having these records made into a proper book?{nl}I took special care with the binding, so make sure you use them well.
Look at how Justas binded Demetrius' records.
{nl}He ought to take care of other people's records the way he does his own...{nl}Anyway, let me see those.
Here; I binded them back nice and tight.{nl}Now be gentle with them.
Should I pull on the rope again?
I should find a spot where it's easier to grab the rope.
Can't grab the rope from here.
A well?
It just tastes like water.
Fortunately it doesn't look contaminated.
It doesn't taste like much but it's easy to drink.
Can't make the rope move, even from here.
It seems to be stuck.
I should leave it alone.
This is the camp where Varkis was doing research.
There's only a bonfire left now.
Varkis told me to watch out for that man.
Varkis left a record behind when he died.
Did you meet him?{nl}You always need to be careful when a stranger is too kind to you.
Earthly attachment isn't letting me go back to the goddess, I guess.{nl}Why did you call?
{nl}That man...?{nl}Oh, I don't know, my memory is fuzzy.{nl}Probably because I died.
Are you taking good care of my records?{nl}You didn't throw them away or anything, did you?
You need to be careful with that man...{nl}It's just like I told you.
{nl}You never know when he might change.{nl}I can tell he's approaching you with a very... specific goal in mind.
An unknown barrel.
A strong scent of alcohol is coming from the broken barrel. It must have been a mead barrel.
The barrel broke. What kind of barrel is this?
There's a barrel. Kick it?

Andale Village Resident Diary
{nl}{nl}{@ST43}Andale Village Resident Diary{/}
{nl}-The 4th of X {nl} - {nl} There's been very little traffic coming to town from the capital. {nl} When one family moved in, the whole village threw a welcome party. {nl} After all, how many outsiders do we get to meet these days? {nl}
The 10th of X {nl} - {nl} Mr. Raman, who lived at the bank of the creek opposite from us, went on leave. His wife said he was off to get firewood. {nl} Well, for a long time he was gone in Klaipeda. {nl}I've heard that you can find a lot of beautiful girls in Klaipeda. {nl}
The 16th of X {nl} - {nl} I got a stomachache drinking soup that I didn't know already went bad. {nl} I double-checked the smell before eating it, but there was no bad odor. {nl}I felt horrible inside so I went to the well for water. Even with the water, I continued to feel horrible. {nl}
I've been throwing up a lot lately but it seems to be getting better now. {nl}Tomorrow I'm going to go see Mr. Gordon to get some medicinal herbs. {nl} My little sister still hasn't come back yet. When I go to her room, I find no clothes. Even Mr. Raman is getting worried.
The 17th of X {nl} - {nl} The village was eerily quiet today. {nl}There are no signs of the people who went earlier to get herbs from Mr. Gordon.{nl}{nl}The 23rd of X {nl} - {nl} This might be the last time I get to write in this diary. {nl} Lyliana, you are the only family I have left in this world... {nl} Please be alive somewhere... {nl}
I was just about to go gather a few more materials before heading to Orsha.{nl}Oh, but...
{nl}What are those notes you're carrying?{nl}They look a bit... damaged.
{nl}They're going to rip and fall off if you keep carrying them like that.{nl}I do have a few leather strings that are a little too short to use on scriptures...
Since you were so kind to find me leather string and paper for my scriptures, this time I'm repaying the favor.{nl}Here you go.
{nl}This should keep your notes from ripping apart.
Are you taking good care of that... diary, was it?{nl}The one I binded??繞섑??you.{nl}I can't wait to see the day where all my scriptures are also completed.
That book, though... it says Andale Village... What is it?{nl}That's the village where I used to live...
This is... my brother's diary...{nl}...
{nl}He was so happy that a new family moved in...
{nl}But then... the village... and my brother...
Please take that diary...{nl}And, just... leave me alone for a while... please. 
{nl}You can ask any questions you want later... Just not now...
... I just don't want to talk... Not right now...
Our headman said Andale was one of seven villages founded a long time ago.{nl}The region is said to have been found by a hunter who got lost. In this region, people built a beautiful shrine along with the seven villages.
{nl}The villages shared a stream of clear water that turned the moss and the trees into beautiful colors...{nl}But one elder in Andale Village was suspicious of this color-changing water.
{nl}The people of Andale did not drink from the stream and gathered their water from a well.{nl}Meanwhile, all the other villages drank the stream water for a long time.
{nl}The water from the stream, however, wasn't fit for drinking.{nl}One by one, people from the other villages started to fall ill.
{nl}In the end, out of the seven villages, six became impossible to live in and were abandoned.{nl}I guess these villages were all but forgotten... and Andale, too, was no longer sought by outsiders.
{nl}Now... I'm guessing Andale Village is also deserted...{nl}From what I heard after coming here, this was all a curse by Demon Goddess Giltine.{nl}
That new family that moved in...{nl}I actually never saw them.
{nl}My brother was too excited about having outsiders around and did visit them once or twice.{nl}Oh, now that I think of it... Wow...
{nl}Every time we made a ceremony to the goddesses, they always said they were sick and never came.{nl}Why did I not notice it then...?
{nl}The truth is, if that day I hadn't fought with my brother and left the village, the same thing would have happened to me...
My brother was a good person.{nl}He was a talented cook and, even when we short on food, he liked sharing his dishes with the neighbors.
{nl}The whole reason we fought that day was because he wanted to make porridge for the neighbors with the last few potatoes we had...
{nl}Our neighbor, Mr. Raman, was always praising my brother.{nl}He must be gone now, too... Taken by those demons...
Dusty Objects
A pile of dusty abandoned objects.{nl}Have a look?
There's an old bowl with water.
It's only dust.
Guess there isn't much to find other than this bowl.
I bet this is nothing.
This looks like it will be dangerous to tamper with.
Nothing interesting to see here.
Smokey Spot
Should I throw away the water from before here?
Nothing changed.
Oh...
{nl}Now that I think about it...
{nl}You're back.{nl}Is there anything else you want to know?
A long time ago, goddesses and demons made an agreement that they would not interfere with each other.{nl}One of the conditions of this pact was that demons were not allowed to murder humans.
{nl}Then, 600 years ago, Gesti placed a curse in the Roxona region.{nl}She did so under the pretext that it was in response to Ruklys' rebellion.
{nl}Goddess Dalia stood forward to help those in Roxona.{nl}The petrified city with the forgotten name...
{nl}Then, the demons appeared and brought up the agreement.{nl}They claimed that the victims had not been murdered, merely petrified, and attacked Goddess Dalia.{nl}That is how she became trapped in the curse of the demon goddess.
{nl}The curse imparted in Goddess Dalia clashed with her own divine force, forming something immensely more powerful.{nl}This left Dalia in the state you know Her as...
{nl}That is why the entire area was burned to the ground...{nl}There was nothing that could bring the goddess back to her own conscience...
{nl}So the three Demon Kings imprisoned Dalia, and the Kupoles were left to watch over Her.{nl}No other goddesses dared to interfere with the petrified city after that.
{nl}Some might criticize the goddesses for their lack of action when they hear about this.{nl}But I believe it was a reasonable choice to make at the time.
Oh no...{nl}But then, who would frame someone like that?
{nl}And why...?
The secret could have been hidden in Ruklys' memorial.{nl}The truth about the real hero who took the blame at the time, that is...
Why would Premier Eminent think of doing something like that?{nl}I ought to investigate further.
It won't be easy now that the contents of the memorial are gone.{nl}I wonder if there isn't a way to recover them...
Glad to see you again.{nl}What's the occasion?
So Ruklys was not a traitor?{nl}That means that rubbed copy was still useful...
I can get some more charcoal and make a new copy of Lydia Schaffen's tombstone.{nl}Should be able to read it then, right?
{nl}We might even get some insight into her history, don't you think?
{nl}It's still a relief, you know?{nl}With the way the world is nowadays, some people never get to clean their own name.
{nl}At least some can still get their honor back.
{nl}Not sure if that's a blessing or a curse.
Explaining Owl
Hmm, it seems like you're still curious about something, are you?{nl}Are you interested in what's going to happen to the owls now?
I can't see much from where I stand, so I spent a lot of time on my own.{nl}I don't know if you humans are like this too, but spending time alone, thinking, makes us realize certain things.
{nl}Where we came from, things like that...
Maybe you realized those things through your journeys.{nl}Us owls, you can say that we're signs of Tesla's immortality.
{nl}Strictly speaking, us owls are merely sculptures.{nl}Perhaps some owls never realize that...
{nl}In any case, it's because we are born that Tesla keeps on living.{nl}
I thought about it for a long time.{nl}Even as I witnessed all the spirits being guided by the owls.
{nl}What am I, where did I come from, and where am I going...?
All those who have crossed my path, travelers, revelators...{nl}All the pilgrims... the girl...
{nl}From the things they said, from what I saw the first time I opened my eyes...{nl}I realized.
{nl}I realized that I'm a sculpture...
{nl}There are other beings whose task is to guide spirits.{nl}The Kupoles, that is...{nl}But they are closer to goddesses, which us sculptures are not.
Owls... Us, owls...
All owls help spirits find eternal rest by the goddess.{nl}That is what I do as well.
{nl}That is what I am doing here at this very moment.
I have been busier lately.{nl}From guiding the spirits, that is.
Five objects that look like Yellow Gazing Golem Cores are engraved on the tombstone.
The Yellow Gazing Golem was sucked into the tombstone.
There's something here. Let me have a closer look.
An unknown script is starting to appear on the tombstone.
An unknown script has appeared on the tombstone.
I've never seen a script like this. It's best to ask someone with more knowledge.
A ripped piece of paper. There's something written on it, but it's hard to tell what it is.
The other pieces of the paper are needed to read the full text. Look for them in Genar Field.
There is a set of runes engraved on the tombstone, but I don't know what they mean.

Rune Tombstone
I was going to bless the soldiers but it seems I ran out of holy powder.{nl}You wouldn't happen to be carrying some, would you?
Thank you. This is just what I need to bless those soldiers.
It's going to take far too long for me to restock...{nl}I don't have the time...
We have no time to waste.{nl}Quick, light a bonfire and get yourself warm.
How did you get stung? Doesn't it hurt?
The bees are very sensitive right now, so they'll attack more easily.
I dunno... We also tried everything we could think of, but nothing worked.{nl}The followers of goddess Austeja will probably know more about it.
The followers of Goddess Austeja probably know a better way to calm down the bees.
Seems like the forest nearby was also having a bit of a problem with its plants.
I'm not sure, but if there's any related materials I guess I can have a look.{nl}Maybe that can help me find something.
After the last letdown, now it's time for success!
Sounds like a terrified scream.
Many people fell victim to the petrifying curse here.{nl}I came to guide their spirits to the side of the goddess.
The poor petrified victims are living in terror every day.
I want to help them, but I don't know how.
Found some Carnivore remains at the spot where it was defeated.
A box appeared.
I can't even remember the last time I had a strawberry. Would you happen to have some with you?
If I had strawberries I could make some icey strawberry punch...{nl}The blacksmith in my village loves iced strawberry punch.
I used to drink strawberry punch him with all the time.{nl}Sometimes he'd do a less-than-stellar job at repairing a weapon or something.
Every time he would say it was the iced punch that made his hands slip.
But I know.{nl}It wasn't the strawberry punch's fault, he just makes a lot of mistakes, that's all.
In my village there was a girl called Ailije. She was a merchant, but she had a great hand for cooking and often made food or sauces for other people. Her strawberry jam was the best. I also learned how to make strawberry jam from her. Any time we had strawberries at the camp, I always made strawberry jam and shared with the other soldiers. 
Strawberries, strawberries! Oh, I can't wait to eat them...{nl}Thank you so much. These are a treat!
The air feels cold.
A strong force is pushing away. What is it?
The divine spirit seems angered. I should find a way to calm them down.
You say there's an angry spirit in Escanciu Village?
They must miss the sound of music.
They seem to enjoy it.
The evil spirit cursed me. I should ask someone who knows about curses to help me.
The evil spirit is mocking me. I should ask someone who knows about curses to help me.
I sense a curse in you.
I can help you dispell it.
Where were you cursed?{nl}The malice in your curse was too deep to be human-made.
An evil spirit...
I worry the spirit will disturb those who rest in the Mokusul Chamber.
I believe the Warlock Master will know what to do about this evil spirit in the Mokusul Chamber.

Ripped Piece of Paper
I think I have all the pieces now. Let me try and put them together.
Objects on the Ground
There's something here.{nl}Should I touch it?
The position of Appraiser Master has been vacant since Medzio Diena, which put me in a rather difficult situation.
{nl}I figured I could sell my family heirloom and help those less fortunate, even if only a little.{nl}I heard the Pardoner Master has an interest in old heirlooms, so I went to see him.
{nl}Unfortunately he doesn't want anything that's not certified by the Appraiser Master.{nl}If only someone took over the position...
Maybe you won't believe me, but I'm actually involved in helping the refugees.{nl}With the money I make selling my accessories, that is.
{nl}Recently, however, some merchants have been making forgeries of my products and selling them on the market.{nl}My sales have suffered because I can't compete with their fake accessories.
{nl}That makes it difficult for me to help the refugees.{nl}If only I had a sort of certificate to prove that my products are genuine.
{nl}Unfortunately only an Appraiser Master can do that, and no one has taken the position since Medzio Diena.
{nl}There's really nothing I can do about it.
I didn't realize the absence of an Appraiser Master caused so much inconvenience.{nl}I suppose it won't be solved until someone steps up to the position.
{nl}Usually the king would be the one to appoint a new class master, but considering we don't have one anymore... Hmm...
{nl}Although, a royal carte blanche could be useful in this situation.{nl}A sort of document with powers granted by someone in the royal family or a figure of authority.
{nl}I believe an attendant of Princess Gaivile is staying in Klaipeda at the moment, I should try and contact them.
Knight Commander Uska went to speak with the attendant of Princess Gaivile about the position of Appraiser Master.
I've just returned from speaking with Princess Gaivile's attendant.{nl}The princess has agreed to grant us a royal order.
{nl}To make the order valid, we need it signed by at least three people of high authority.{nl}This could be a high-tier commander or a noble person in a position of similar power.
{nl}As a knight commander myself, I'll take the liberty of being the first to sign it.{nl}Now, as for the other two signatures...
{nl}It will be difficult for the princess' attendant to travel, not to mention he will be busy with his duties.{nl}So I told him I would pass the task onto you.{nl}What do you say?
Pricess Gaivile's Attendant
I was just about to tend to my work for Princess Gaivile.
Uska told me you would come.{nl}As you can see, I am too busy with my duties to Princess Gaivile to gather the signatures.
{nl}I hope that is why you came to see me.{nl}On a first impression I can tell Uska was right to trust you.{nl}But enough chatter, I should tell you what it is you will need to do first.
{nl}Visit the southern regions of the kingdom and search for people of nobility or with a certain degree of power.{nl}Then, obtain their signature on the royal order.
{nl}Do this and your royal order will be given authority equivalent to that of our former king.
Gather the signatures of noble people and figures of authority from the southern regions of the kingdom.
Uska ought to send someone any time soon...{nl}I have work to do...
I'm very glad this is in the hands of someone Uska trusts.
You need my signature on a royal order?{nl}Very well, let me have a look at it first.
{nl}Hm... It seems you're trying to nominate someone to the position of Appraiser Master.
{nl}Here, I've signed it for you.
So you need me to sign a royal order?{nl}Alright, I'll have a look at it.
{nl}Oh, this is an order from the princess to nominate Sandra to the position of Appraiser Master.{nl}Yes, I can sign it for you.
Royal Order
By the power invested in me as the effective agent of His Majesty, late ruler of our great kingdom, I, Kaonilla, hereby declare the present order, in benefit of the people of our nation, in the wake of the greatest disaster it has witnessed in more than a millennium of history.
In the scope of my duty as member of the royal family to preserve order and peace for all of the kingdom's subjects, the present order serves as a limited yet necessary action in the current state of institutional and legislative instability of our nation.
It is my sincere wish that they who bear this order will not make use of it for personal gain nor act on corrupt intentions upon obtaining it.
1. In the possession of a suitable bearer, the present order shall be considered equivalent to a royal decree of the king.{nl}2. The present order shall not be valid until it has been verified and signed by no less than three generals or commanders of the royal army, or noble persons of similar authority.{nl}3. I, Kaonilla, as agent of the kingdom, consent to full responsibility for the legislative repercussions of the present order.{nl}4. Any unjust orders commanded or performed under the authority of the present document shall remain valid until directly condemned by an agent of the royal family.{nl}5. It is the responsibility of the bearer of the present order to obtain the approval required for its validity as defined in article 2.
To the bearer of the present order I, Princess Gaivile, under the command of Kaonilla, hereby declare that Appraiser Sandra, resident of Fedimian, will be promptly assigned the position of Appraiser Master.
Klaipeda Knight Commander Uska
The royal order smells slightly of chemicals.
The empty space between the contents of the order and the first signature looks far too wide.
The royal order looks a little suspicious.{nl}Someone ought to know about it.
Are you saying the royal order looks strange?{nl}In what way, may I ask?
Very well, let me have a look.
Indeed, the blank space here is rather wide and it does smell of chemicals.{nl}In this day, a royal order from a successor like Princess Kaonilla...
{nl}But didn't you say you obtained this through Princess Gaivile?{nl}Then I believe this order ought to be analyzed one more time before it returns to her.
There must be someone who can have a look at the royal order.
Oh... This is the royal order Uska got to nominate me to Appraiser Master.{nl}But you say it smells like chemicals... and the gap between the lines is too wide?
{nl}That really is strange.{nl}Official royal documents are usually redacted with no spaces in between the lines, you see.{nl}To prevent them from being altered.
{nl}Let me have a better look at it.{nl}May I?
As you mentioned, the document does smell slightly of chemicals.{nl}That fact that you noticed that is quite impressive in itself.
{nl}As for the space between the contents of the order and the signature... It does look like there's something there.{nl}I can't make much of it yet for now, however.
{nl}To get a more accurate analysis I would need a special chemical.{nl}Unfortunately it's very rare... although an experienced alchemist might be able to produce some.{nl}Do you know any alchemists we could ask?
Do you mean a chemical to reveal invisible ink?{nl}I don't really talk about this to anyone but... given our relationship, I think it's okay to let you in on it.
{nl}I can actually make some really easily with a special reagent and some Weynd and Driekple flowers.{nl}I'll give you a recipe for the reagent.{nl}The flowers are a little more difficult to find, however.
{nl}If you can find some Weynd flowers, picking them should be easy.{nl}The problem is finding them. No one knows where they grow.
{nl}Driekple flowers need to be watered at regular times with the right amount of water.
Oh wow, you really did bring all the materials to make the chemical.{nl}I'm very curious to hear how you got the flowers, but first I should finish the chemical.
The special chemical is finished now.{nl}You should be able to see the hidden writings now.
I really want to know what you're going to use it for, but you look worried enough so I won't ask.
Vaidotas is making the special chemical.
Take the special chemical to Appraiser Sandra.
You got the special chemical from Vaidotas?{nl}Wow... You really are something, aren't you?
{nl}Alright, I'm going to use the chemical and see whether there is anything hidden in the royal order.
I applied the special chemical to the blank space in the order and I found something.{nl}I'm going to make a copy of the order and erase the hidden words, just in case.
I erased what was written in the black space and made a copy of the order.{nl}I think the people who signed the document should know about it too, though.
{nl}You can go and tell the Lord of Orsha first, she will know what to do about the others.
Do you mean there was something hidden in the royal order?{nl}How does one... in an official document of the kingdom...
{nl}May I know what was written in the hidden section?
We almost fell into Princess Gaivile's schemes.{nl}You're certain Sandra erased all the hidden writings from the original order, are you?
{nl}Very well. I will deliver this copy of the order to the others who signed it.{nl}Make sure Princess Gaivile's attendant knows of the hidden section in the original document.
You've collected all the signatures, I see.{nl}That means Appraiser Sandra will now officially become the new Appraiser Master.
Deliver the letter of appointment to Appraiser Sandra.
It's my letter of appointment to become the new Appraiser Master.{nl}I wish this could have happened in a more peaceful world with His Majesty still alive...
{nl}Anyway, thank you.{nl}
{nl}If only my parents were still around to see me become a Master...
Appraiser Master
To think that I'm the new Appraiser Master now...{nl}It was all so sudden, I'm still in awe.
{nl}You can rest assured I'm going to do my absolute best at the job.
To assess the value of an object, you have to look at it from different perspectives.{nl}Only then will you start to see what others can't.{nl}That, my friend, is the joy of working as an Appraiser.
The work in Fedimian has been so busy ever since I became the Master.{nl}That's why I thought I would send you instead.
{nl}I do feel a little uneasy about leaving a valuable heirloom in someone else's hands, but...
I'm glad I could finally get my family heirloom valued.{nl}Now that I have a certificate, I can sell it to the Pardoner Master and help those less fortunate.
It's a shame the Appraiser Master couldn't be here herself.{nl}Will you be looking at my accessories then?
{nl}Alright.{nl}I'll leave my products up to you.
I'm glad my accessories can now be certified as authentic.

I'm very glad to hear the royal order was well delivered.{nl}And of course, I was happy to be part of it.
STR is vital for a Swordsman class.{nl}Invest stat points in it and increase your physical attack and critical attack. On top of that, you can carry more items with you.{nl}
{nl}Think carefully about the path you want to take and it will make your choices easier.
{nl}However, you shouldn't forget SPR if you want to use mostly magic.{nl}It will increase your maximum SP and SP recovery so you can cast more skills.

To take free will away from humans is something even the goddesses condemn.{nl}But what the Monk Master Olfas Grimm has planned, whether right or wrong, is harmful to many people and can even kill them.{nl}That is what saddens me.
The Monk Master wants to train mercenary gladiators in secret and trade them to gain control of the capital's arena. Morally, I find this hard to condone.{nl}But it seems Olfas Grimm himself believes his deeds are justified for contributing to a greater good.
Monks are different from other Cleric faiths in that they pay service to the goddesses not through their relation to Them, but through self-training.{nl}However, by breaking his deal with the Corsair Master and refusing to pay, Grimm has disregarded even the values any good business person should have.{nl}Although I do agree that, as Monk Master, keeping a promise to a pirate would do nothing but harm.
Monks believe it is right to do not what the goddesses want, but what the goddesses need.{nl}For people like Olfas Grimm, their physical training only reinforces this belief, the idea that anything is justifiable if it is for the sake of the goddesses.{nl}It came as a surprise to everyone when, without hesitation, he broke the double contract he had signed with the Schwarzer Reiter and Doppelsoeldner Masters.
Nemoken borrowed a large sum from the Monk Master in order to lure assassin Evoniphon by pretending to hire him.{nl}In the end, she could neither catch Evoniphon not return the money.{nl}This was a chance for the Monk Master to find her weakness.{nl}He may have no plans to take advantage of this weakness yet, but he surely won't forget it after they are even.
It's true that Hayraven, the Corsair Master, has become kinder after Medzio Diena forced him to return to solid ground.{nl}But that does not excuse all the crimes he commited before that.
Hayraven was always most violent when attacking other pirate ships.{nl}Many were the times when he pillaged whole merchant vessels, and to rival pirates he was particularly cruel.{nl}He did not kill those whom he captured; instead he sent them over to the Monk Master, but he never received payment for it. You can see why Hayraven isn't very fond of Olfas Grimm now.
In a way, Hayraven is someone in charge of his own destiny.{nl}In the eyes of the goddesses, he is no more important than the Great Pirate Vladslovas whom he had killed.{nl}Ultimately, he turned fate in his favor out of sheer will.{nl}And perhaps a little help from his cunning nature...
Had Jurate, goddess of the sea, been a little more interested in the lives of humans, the sea would have been peaceful, with or without the royal navy.{nl}When She did come into contact with humans again, Hayraven was already on land after losing his ship.{nl}It was all due to Medzio Diena.
The only reason why the Corsair Master is not preparing to return to the sea now that the royal navy is weakened, is that there aren't as many ships sailing anymore.{nl}It may sound contradictory, but him going back to the sea would be a sign of the Kingdom returning to normal life.
Before Medzio Diena, the Corsair Master came across a few of the Doppelsoeldner Master's soldiers at sea and destroyed their ship.{nl}Guerra, the Doppelsoeldner Master, has hated him since.{nl}Both Masters aren't the type to shy away from one-on-one confrontations, but neither do they tend to get involved in anything that isn't profitable.{nl}It's hard to even say who would win if they were ever to face each other.
After Olfas Grimm broke his contract with the Doppelsoeldner Master and embezzled the money, he's been searching for legal ways to take revenge on the Monk Master.{nl}He would not be satisfied with merely having him killed.
As leaders of mercenary groups, the Doppelsoeldner and Schwarzer Reiter Masters haven't always been on good terms.{nl}But after the contract misadventure with the Monk Master, his grudge became only deeper.
Unlike the Schwarzer Reiter Master, Guerra values his group's reputation, authority, and most of all, profits.{nl}He believes these factors to be crucial when it comes to increasing their combat power and strategic expertise.
Guerra is not, in fact, the Doppelsoeldner Master's birth name.{nl}Many assume that, by adopting a new name, he was either attempting to disguise his noble ancestry due to his activities as a mercenary leader, or the opposite, his low-class origins.{nl}I do know the truth about his heritage, but I mustn't reveal a personal secret.
Warsis, the Schwarzer Reiter Master, originally descends from a family of commoners.{nl}He adopted his surname from subordinates and enemies who, astounded by his competence, gave him the nickname of Creak.
Unlike the Doppelsoeldner Master and his mercenaries, the Schwarzer Reiter Master is more akin to a war aficionado.{nl}He promotes comradeship among his mercenaries, with all profits earned benefiting both him and his subordinates.{nl}An ideal troupe to him is one of talented warriors joined together by deep comradeship and strict military discipline.
Upon learning about what happened to the subordinates he had taken over from the Monk Master, the Schwarzer Reiter Master was as furious as if he had been personally attacked himself.{nl}Since this incident, Warsis Creak despises the Monk Master, but also Hayraven and the Doppelsoeldner Master, due to what he considers a dishonest management of mercenaries.
Warsis Creak, the Schwarzer Reiter Master, is a prime figure in the military field.{nl}He is a man of astounding combat prowess and strategic technique, but also of considerable social and cultural refinement.{nl}The reason he hasn't applied for the royal army is that he believes he would be unable to experiment with and master diverse types of weapons and techniques.
As a leader with fairly liberal views, the Schwarzer Reiter Master will not hesitate to introduce new guns or other weapons to his group of mercenaries.{nl}Because of this, he is considered to be the most decent Master among the four who run mercenary troupes.
Rashua, the Swordsman Master, had dedicated his entire life to military service.{nl}Now, he merely tries to bear with the agony of witnessing the misery that has struck the kingdom.
Maria Leed, the Peltasta Master, believes that taking part in combat should earn anyone proper compensation.{nl}But most of all, to her, going to battle is a question of honor.{nl}It's one of the reasons why she remains so impassive to the Highlander Master's persuasion.
Highlander Master Douglas Black is a courteous, dignified man, as much so as the residence he inherited from the distinguished family of which he descends.
I still feel like I am in debt to Walder Junnot, the Barbarian Master, for never having had the time to really help his family.
I strongly believe we will one day live in a peaceful world where Hoplite Master Aidas Valor and his partner Flyntess??以춏 raise a family.
Kamiya, the Rodelero Master, is an outstanding soldier, but he isn't sure which army he ought to serve.{nl}I try not to interfere and instead respect his decisions.
Memet Culag, the Cataphract Master, forwent marriage to follow his own path.{nl}He may have no descendants to carry his name, but his achievements certainly will.
Justina Legwyn, the Squire Master, is the last descendant of her family. It's an unfortunate destiny, having to carry the responsibility of both those positions...
At her young age, Sorscha Hutton is already set to become the greatest Fencer Master to date.{nl}Anyone who dares to cross her path can only expect to face the cold blade of destiny.
Born to a family of commoners, Uska grew to become a general of the royal army, Knight Commander and Templar Master.{nl}His sword is respected wherever he goes, and he is as responsible as he is talented.
Valeska Himil, Dragoon Master and representative of the Himils, is set to have an important role in the future of her family.{nl}No one knows whether their spear will return to Schaffenstar or not, but  either way it's going to be a historic decision.
Shinobi Master Yura Swanjone works behind the scenes with the royal family, stealthily thwarting any forces that dare threaten the throne.
Phelixia, the Murmillo Master, does not shy away from putting her life on the line.{nl}With anything she does, however, she puts tremendous effort into making sure she is ahead and in charge of her destiny.
Noer Parecius, descendant of a great king! The throne may never belong to him, but his lance will certainly have him remembered as a king of war.
Centurion Master Krajicek is a role model to every member of the royal army.{nl}It's a shame that the current state of the army is hindering him.
I truly respect the Matador Master's outlook on life.{nl}It simply saddens me that her incredible talent and influence can be put to wrongful use in the world.
The Wizard Master used to be considered the least gifted among the magic Masters.{nl}Her current skill, however, is no lesser than that of any talented Master.{nl}I admire her effort.
I admire the vision of Abreh Melinn for finding a new point of contact between Clerics and Wizards.{nl}Who else but her would be fit for the position of Pyromancer Master?
Cryomancer Master Aleister Crowley is a very clever man. He may be loyal, but he isn't innocent, and he won't hesitate to deceive others for his own benefit. That is all I have to say about him.
Behind the appearances, Ili Terid, the Psychokino Master, hides a fragile heart and a yearning to have his genius recognized.{nl}This despite him having developed powers before he learned about magic, and being recognized as an outstanding merchant even before his powers manifested.
Winona Ende, the Linker Master, is a genius of the kind that is rare to find even among the most notable figures in magic academia.{nl}In about 170 years, she may very well surpass legends like Lucid Winterspoon and Owyn Dilven.
Larisa will only live as much as the average human being.{nl}Ultimately that is what will keep her from fully developing her genius.
Wican Celestic, the Elementalist Master, is dreaming of a love that is unattainable.{nl}The woman he loves is solely interested in eternal life and does not care for marriage.
The Sorcerer Master may still be young, but she's very concerned about aging and death.{nl}I can't say whether she's going to become an Amzinas, however.{nl}The same is true for the Oracle Master, which could be one of the reasons why Dame Circe does not care for Apolonjia.
Lucid Winterspoon?繹ル뫃s lived for many centuries, never fully retreating into solitude nor actively stepping out into the world.{nl}I respect her free will, but I do think that, like time itself, to others she is merely a flowing presence.
Loretta Nimbus is the Necromancer Master and the youngest of the Amzinas. She's chasing after  a goal that's impossible to reach.
The Alchemist Master is very concerned about carrying the reputation of the Winterspoon family, but his is a name that will not be degraded.{nl}It's a shame he seems so insecure about it.
I'm curious about the future of Warlock Master Melanie Melachim.{nl}Being constantly surrounded by demons due to her profession has caused in her a certain opacity.
My sisters and I had hoped to become the pillar of all humans in the world.{nl}We remain faithful, but we feel remorseful to those like Featherfoot Master Kyoll Lurawa.
The Shadowmancer Master has always strived to be just an ordinary person, but her destiny says otherwise.{nl}Her extraordinary nature will forever accompany her.
I wonder what could have happened if Yena Havindar and Jane had lived in the same era.
Part of the books Rhupas Kehel is searching for are in the possession of Winona Ende.{nl}No human knows of this fact, however.
It was a long time ago that Rune Caster Master Shelly Pennington left her hometown to move to the south of the kingdom.{nl}Soon, her empty post could very well lead to misfortune.{nl}When it does, someone else will need to take her position.
Rozalija, a Siauliai native, had always dreamed of becoming a healer.{nl}It was only after Medzio Diena that she came to follow the path of Cleric Master.{nl}One of the rare positive outcomes of that tragic day.
The Krivis Master is a keeper of all the beliefs of which humans have memory.{nl}He may not be aware of this himself, but his order comprises even ancient beliefs which humans do not know.
Boruble's wish is to one day pass on the position of Priest Master to become the Chaplain Master, but first he must ask himself whether he can maintain his devotion when his life is at risk in the battlefield.{nl}Volunteering in the army would be one way to find out.
Mama Marie Lavoie, the Bokor Master, lives as a messenger between people and their fate. As assistant to the goddess of destiny, hers is a work for which I am always grateful.
Tesla is the elder of all humanity. I want to say that, in times like these, being represented in his sculptures is an honor to the goddesses.
Paladin Master Valentinas Naimon will continue to be one of four pillars sustaining the kingdom through difficult times.{nl}I have nothing else to ask of him after the pledge of Tenet Church.
Sadhu Master Agota Hanska was the first person in this era to receive a Revelation. It was this that brought her into the path of the clerics.
Pardoner Master Mistes Goldmund is able to find a balance between that which is material and conceptual, and express in numbers a type of devotion which is unmeasurable.{nl}He may have a tendency to go too far, but I can't deny someone like him is needed in the order.
Many know Druid Master Gina Greene to be the wealthiest person in the kingdom.{nl}I, too, agree.{nl}I believe, however, considering the large savings she deposited with the Kedora Alliance, that among her lands is??arconsi's hidden mine.{nl}Whether that is true, of course, is unknown by even Gina herself...
The Oracle Master is a cleric who has managed to maintain her connection with the goddesses even after they went missing.
Kabbalists are discoverers of hidden rules and explorers of universal principles. As their leader, Libgar Hippathia is currently serving the kingdom from a lower position, although I do wish she returns to her official role someday.
Had Cleric Master Rozalija been a few years older than Plague Doctor Master Philip Aurellius, she would have been the one to take over the role.{nl}It's unfortunate, as not many people are talented in both regular healing and divine treatment as she is.
Inquisitors are the clerics which most assist the goddesses.{nl}In recent times, their leader, Thomas Iquinostasys, has taken on the unprecedented task of deciphering the true will of the goddesses with Them absent from the world we know.
Ceslovas, who could have succeeded as any kind of cleric, bravely chose the path of war priest to later become Chaplain Master, the first commoner to do so in 91 years.{nl}The role of royal Chaplains is not to pray for dying soldiers, and becoming one without the support of a noble family is something that happens as rarely as once in a century.
Taoists are a unique kind of clerics. They approach the divine not by worshiping the goddesses, but by understanding and cultivating human nature.{nl}As Taoist Master, Geuhong holds the records of all those who chose this path since times past.
If there's anything the Miko Master lacks, it's diligence.{nl}As the link that connects divine spirits with our world, it's a shame it is so.
Edmundas Tiller, the Archer Master, has been most interested in the construction process of the Astral Tower.{nl}He believes it would be helpful in reinforcing Klaipeda's security installations, but he also aspires to become someone of the caliber of Lydia Schaffen.
Besides the Archer Master, Quarrel Shooter Master Ream Toiler is also interested in reinforcing Klaipeda's security installations.{nl}Some people think he is gathering too many stones, but he isn't thinking of using them all as projectiles.
I believe Nemoken wouldn't be happy if she knew that Evoniphon's life is in your hands more than it is in hers.
I'm afraid there isn't much I can tell you about Fiona Ieva, out of respect for her privacy.{nl}What I can tell you is that her talent and past achievements are certainly worthy of respect as Hunter Master.
I can only hope one day the Sapper Master will know that his father truly worried for him in his last moments.
As a new recruit, the Scout Master may have a low rank in the army now, but in the long run may very well become an admiral, just as long as she stays in the army.
Wor Pat wishes for her younger sibling to continue honoring the Wugushi tradition.{nl}It is rare for a minority to gain the recognition of the royal family and ascend to the role of Master, so she is going to need to prove herself.
Rogue Master Gema may not be a model of altruism, but she isn't someone of bad nature, either.
Visvaldas Black can often become too engrossed in the achievements of the first Fletcher Master.{nl}It is true that he has the reputation of the Black family to maintain, but regardless of his descendence, I believe he is already a brilliant Master.
In the past, the positions of Falconer and Hunter Master were often held by the same person.{nl}It was Fiona Ieva who, after discovering a talented young hawk trainer, agreed to separate the two positions.{nl}Genklas Metai, incidentally, was born in the kingdom's capital.
Eda Saker Bazaras holds the highest degree of nobility among all Masters.{nl}In military terms, of course, her rank falls short to that of Uska or Noer Parecius.{nl}As far as titles go, however, hers is superior even to that of the Lord of Orsha.
Alloden Marzarine went through innumerable jobs before becoming Musketeer Master.{nl}He was a monster hunter, a bounty hunter, a soldier, a guard and many professions, all involving weapons.
I am very grateful to Mergen Master Vhangomont Breogen moving over to the kingdom to honor his pact with Lydia Schaffen.
Hackapell Master Flyntess continues to dream of a newlywed home with the Hoplite Master, although it's hard to tell when that will become a reality.
Appraiser Master Sandra may not have inherited her late father's magic talent, but his hobby of analyzing collectible goods was what got her started in her carreer.
Our faith is with you, who have received the goddess' Revelations.{nl}May you honor our kingdom.

The Great Pirate and Hayraven, Final Volume
In front of the ruthless Vladslovas,{nl}stood a much younger Hayraven.{nl}From the splashing waves, to the rocking boats...{nl}
Hayraven drew his cutlass first,{nl}and began to attack Vladslovas in swift movements,{nl}aiming once for the chest, twice for each side of the torso.{nl}
But his attacks were too obvious to Vladslovas.{nl}So, upon getting a hold of Hayraven's cutlass,{nl}he kicked him in the pit of his stomach, knocking him over.{nl}
Then, as if teaching the younger pirate a lesson,{nl}he violently hit Hayraven with the grip of his sword.{nl}Hayraven barely managed to escape and got back on his feet.{nl}But he was already injured, and Vladslovas looked set for victory.
Hayraven swallowed once.{nl}Then, he lashed out at him, repeatedly using the same attacks,{nl}even though he knew that it was in vain...{nl}Vladislovas grew bored of toying with the young Hayraven.{nl}Next time it would be the sharpened blade instead of the hilt striking at Hayraven's throat.
Hayraven suddenly turned,{nl}drew a pistol out from its holster and pulled the trigger.{nl}The bullet lodged itself precisely in the middle of Vladislovas' forehead, {nl}making his large body slowly collapse towards Hayraven.{nl}
{nl}The small boat was unable to withstand the combined weight of Vladislovas and Hayraven{nl}and tilted over.{nl}Waves continuously rocked the boat,{nl}and the seagulls that held their breath during the fight had now started to cry again.{nl}
{nl}Here, adventurers like you can take on different mission requests from our receptionists.

The Rogue, Scout and Ranger Masters used to be the closest of friends until the Rogue Master grew apart from them.{nl}I hope one day the three can rekindle their old friendship.
Aleister Crowley, the Cryomancer Master, and Olfas Grimm, the Monk Master, secretly avoid any sort of relationship with each other.{nl}They're both incredibly talented and strong-willed; no good would come of them being either friends or enemies, and they know it.
Sadhu Master Agota Hanska was the first person in this era to receive a Revelation. It was this that brought her into the path of the clerics.

We still haven't received the request certificates, so we're late in collecting the money.
I send out more of my men, and now there's a problem with the certificates...
I need more help...{nl}Would you be willing to fill in?{nl}Go and get the request certificates.
Bring me the certificates, I'll give you generous compensation.
Do you have the certificates?
Are you here for the certificate?{nl}Well, I received all the samples for new Companion feed I asked for.{nl}Things aren't as bad as they were 4 years ago, but I still couldn't have done it on my own.{nl}Thank you.
Thanks to the Golden Note mercenaries my expedition was a success.{nl}Here, let me give you the certificate.{nl}The world may be full of evil things, but some of them aren't so bad if you know how to tame them.
Here's the certificate. My Fedimian accessories arrived safe and sound.{nl}I suppose it's still too dangerous to go beyond Fedimian, huh?{nl}I have friends there, too... Wonder how they're doing.
I mean, it's dangerous enough on the way to Orsha.{nl}Still, thanks to the Golden Note mercenaries I got my hands on some really unique materials.
The equipment was sent to me in perfect condition.{nl}With the world the way it is, I can't afford to walk around without good equipment.{nl}Let me give you the certificate, then.
The equipment I requested from the Kedora Alliance came in perfect condition.{nl}They certainly know the value of good gear.{nl}I suppose that's why they work so hard.
I still don't know where my father is...{nl}But I won't forget how much the Golden Note mercenaries have helped.{nl}I'll give you the certificate right away.
I couldn't go to where the potions were needed myself, but I heard they were very useful.{nl}Thank you.
It's not easy sharing item lists with the markets in other cities.{nl}We're lucky to have the Golden Note mercenaries around.
More and more monster products are being discovered, and the Golden Note mercenaries are helping me trade them.
I heard the items I sent over were delivered safely.{nl}After Medzio Diena, some people were left with belongings here that they can't come and collect, you see...
My client wasn't in Klaipeda or Fedimian...{nl}Do they need to go all the way to the Starlit Lake region?{nl}I should think about it...{nl}But they did search in all the regions I requested, so I should give you the certificate.
A couple of our adventurers were in danger out on a mission...{nl}Unfortunately we couldn't go and help them so we asked the mercenaries.{nl}We were very glad.
Did the mercenaries send you here? I'll get the certificate, just a moment.{nl}The Golden Note were very helpful in getting us moved to Klaipeda.
You know, if something's important it has to be done at all costs.{nl}Unfortunately my arena is gone now...
I'm willing to do anything for my beliefs!{nl}Even if the world sees me as selfish, even if I end up alone, it's what I have to do!
Are you a new priest?
Well, it doesn't matter!{nl}Do you want to contribute to this world?
Catch me some monsters and I'll prepare a reward for you!{nl}You won't regret it!
Give this Revelator a reward if they bring back the monsters.
Monk
You heard the Monk Master. I wish you good luck for today.{nl}The Master said you must defeat 150 monsters if they are as strong as you, 100 monsters if they are stronger, or 300 monsters if they are weaker.
Pity.{nl}No luck today!{nl}You just need more training.
Very good!{nl}I knew I had the right guy.
You may rest now.
The Goddesses have blessed you!!{nl}Congratulations.
The Golden Note mercenaries are growing stronger.
We need to recruit more men...
Are you saying you want to join us?
Alright, let's see it then.
We'll tell you where to go. Prove yourself there and I'll consider it.
Pledge of the Blade Mercenary
So you wanna join the Pledge of the Blade?
We only accept one person per team, do you still want in?
Mysterious Altar
A strange energy is exuded from the altar.
The altar seems to be closed to communication.
Fishing Manager Joha
Hi there!{nl}I'm Joha, Klaipeda's Fishing Manager.
I sell all sorts of fishing supplies.
You can only get this once per team.
You need 25 Silver Fish to exchange for a costume.
Do you need the male or female version of the costume?
I'm in charge of Klaipeda and the regions surrounding it.{nl}You can help me take care of the city.{nl}I'll take care of the other areas.
We've been very busy with requests lately. Just ask the residents for the certificate and bring it over.
Tuxedo Cat
You don't have enough Silver Fish.
The Piece Back Mission event is now open.
Select your desired city.{nl}The city you choose will determine the pieces of the goddess sculptures you can obtain from monsters.{nl}You can reset your city of choice every Tuesday.
You already chose your city this week.
It's too soon.{nl}Use the command '/time' to check how much you have to wait.
Your city choice has been reset.{nl}Please select your city again.
You cannot choose your city today, or you already chose your city for the week.
You cannot choose your city today, or you already chose your city for the week.
Pledge of the Blade Investigator
I can't tell you the full details, but a few of our men were on a mission to retrieve an object stolen from a Loremaster of Goddess Jurate.{nl}The last time we heard from them was near Klaipeda.{nl}We need you to check if there's anyone in West Siauliai Woods who might have seen them.
It can be harder to find clues the more time has passed.
Pledge of the Blade?{nl}Not recently, no. I used to see them around here before the Revelators came.{nl}That was a long time ago, I can't remember that well.
I'm glad to have you on our side, Revelator!
So they were seen in West Woods, very well.{nl}Make sure to ask around again tomorrow, someone else might have seen them.
Give Reward
Titas told me.{nl}You're looking for the Pledge of the Blade, is it?
Yes, I have come across them in the past.{nl}It was before the area became infested with monsters, I can only imagine where they might be now.
Oh! One of them asked if we'd seen anyone from the outside recently and I told them I saw a group of people who looked like they were coming from the beach.
Do you think the mercenaries were trying to find them?{nl}I suppose you'll have to keep chasing them to find out.
This is a cryptogram from our group.{nl}It says...
The people they were chasing were a pirate crew.{nl}They fought amongst each other for the stolen goods, then some of them were killed trying to escape with the loot.{nl}Our mercenaries followed them to the Siauliai East Woods.
Is this the cryptogram your brought from the East Woods?
There isn't much to it.{nl}It says the traces of the pirates end in the East Woods.
Hmm...
It says they found the pirates and defeated them. But there are no signs of the stolen objects.
This one says they found the location of the objects.
They realized some of the crew members were missing after the dispute.{nl}They assumed they had stolen the goods and followed the pirates' trace.{nl}They moved to the Miner's Village.
That's what it says.
You're looking for the Pledge of the Blade, you say?{nl}Hmm...
Oh! I remember.{nl}A long time ago they came to the mine looking for some pirates.{nl}I told them I hadn't seen no pirates, so they asked if I'd seen any outsiders who looked like they were hurt.
But, you know, it was a lot worse back then so those kinds of people were everywhere.
It seems like the pirates disguised themselves.{nl}Please check the village for any more clues.
It appears they found one of the pirates hidden among the refugees and the two groups battled.{nl}They were hurt, but not severely, then they followed the pirate crew to the inside of the mine.
They managed to corner the pirates in Crystal Mine 2F, but in order to avoid any more victims, they were looking to send their weapons to Klaipeda.
A group of mercenaries?{nl}That was a long time ago, was it?
I remember a group of rugged-looking fellows walking up and down the streets, if anyone's seen them it'll be the town merchants.
We ought to speak with the merchants.{nl}I'll check with the other residents.
I did have a few merchants here looking for mining gear.{nl}A few days later they came back wanting to buy something for mountain climbing, said they were going to Srautas Gorge.
Srautas Gorge?{nl}They were either following the pirates there or escaping from them.
Pledge of the Blade?{nl}Yeah, they went to Gele Plateau!{nl}There were other people looking for them at the time, though.{nl}Are they back?
So the mercenaries headed to Gele Plateau.{nl}Someone was after them.{nl}I was the only one sent to look for them, meaning...{nl}Whoever it was, they're related to their disappearance.
This... it says the mercenaries were attacked by an unknown group!{nl}Fortunately they managed to escape.{nl}We should check whether there are any signs of a battle near the cryptogram.
Some of our men use arrows, but ours don't look like this.{nl}We don't use this kind of arrowhead.{nl}We need to find the source of these arrows.
You want me to look at an arrow?{nl}Let's see, then...
I'm no Fletcher Master, but this looks like the arrowheads used by Scouts.
If these are Scout arrows...{nl}We should ask Scout Submaster Suina in Orsha.
This arrowhead...
I don't think I'm the right person to talk about this.{nl}The Ranger Master should be able to tell you more about it.
Does this mean the Ranger Master knows about the battle?{nl}What on earth could have happened to our mercenaries...
Are you saying you found this arrowhead in Gele Plateau?
I think I know what happened...
This is a bit embarrassing, but I need to pay back some cash to Olfas Grimm and I agreed to send a few of my archers to Gele Plateau if he cut my debt in half.{nl}He wanted me to get some kind of compass.{nl}I guess that's how they ran into the Pledge of the Blade.
I don't know what happened exactly, but clearly I was in the wrong here so I'll make sure to apologize to Guerra and his men in person.
I see.{nl}But if they all escaped with only a few injuries, they should have returned by now.{nl}To where did they disappear?{nl}I ought to report this to Guerra and go look for them myself.
Thanks to you, at least now I know where they went.{nl}We appreciate your assistance.
I'm going to investigate a few things before I leave.{nl}Again, thank you.
Are you the Revelator that's been defeating the demons?{nl}If that's fine with you, I could use some help in searching for my mercenaries who went missing.
Traces
This looks suspicious.
Isnel and Panzcir are getting married under the blessing of Goddess Vaivora.{nl}Won't you come and congratulate the new couple?
Earth Tower Lolopanther Area (Recommended Lv: 260) - Only you and your party members can enter together. {nl}Are you sure you want to enter?
This is a bit embarrassing, but I need to pay back some cash to Olfas Grimm and I agreed to send a few of my archers to Gele Plateau if he cut my debt in half.{nl}He wanted me to get some kind of compass.{nl}I guess that's how they ran into the Pledge of the Blade.
I may not have much in stock, but I only have what's good!{nl}Have a look.
Jurate's Kupole
Jurate's Compass was lost in the battle with the demons.{nl}It disappeared at sea, no one knows where it is now.{nl}I am trying to find the compass with the goddess' divine power, but the detector seems to be attracting monsters.{nl}Would you help me watch over it?
If only I can get the detector to work, I can find out where the compass is.{nl}Will you help me?
The detector isn't sensing anything.{nl}I suppose I need to search in a bigger area.{nl}Thank you for your help.

Settler
The crops I planted all died because of some strange energy around here...{nl}I'm a little short-handed though; would you help me get all the dead crops and burn them over the fire?
{nl}If it's too much for you, you can ask other folks to join. I'll make sure to repay you for your hard work.
Thank you so much. Here's a little gift from the settlers.{nl}If you're free to help us any other time, we'd be much appreciated.
Hm? This gift is for the people who helped us.{nl}I'm afraid I can't give you anything if you never helped us.
Hmm... Didn't I already give you something today? I got nothing left to give you.{nl}You need to come back a day after you got your last reward; then I might have something for you.
Sorry, we don't need help anymore. All the work's done, you see.{nl}If you still want to help, you can come back in a while or tomorrow.
I heard Fedimian was safe again so I came all the way here... Well, not only was that wrong, I even got attacked by monsters, can you believe?{nl}If it's not asking too much, would you pick up some of the things I dropped when I was running away?
Oh! Thank you, my friend! But, you see, I was carrying a lot of things. I'm so sorry, but would you pick up some more?{nl}If it's too much, you can get some of your friends to help. I'll make sure to pay you back.
Oooh! My goodness, I thought the monsters had stolen this!{nl}This is expensive, too, I don't know what I would have done if it was gone! Thank you, thank you!
Hm? That's my ledger! Boy, I feel so relieved. You really saved me, huh.{nl}Thank you. A merchant's ledger is their entire life, you know.
Thank you for finding my things! Here's a little gift from me.{nl}It isn't much, but I hope you like it.
Hey, you didn't help find any of my goods, did you?{nl}I'm sorry then, but there's no gift for you. Go back, will you?
Hm? You... already got a gift somewhere else, didn't you?{nl}I'm sorry, but the gifts are limited, I'm afraid I can't give you one.
I can't believe I have to go back with nothing left now.{nl}I'll have to hope I have more luck next time.
Are you all out of holy water? Here, have some.{nl}Come see me again if you need more.

Now I remember how we gobbled up those 2 potatoes without even drinking a drop of water. We choked so hard we had to bang on each other's backs until it went down.

Hauberk's hunter demons set up camp in Ljuba Falls. His scouts created a defense line along the road to Narvas Temple, and both sides are now in conflict at the Gele Vejas Lot. The only way to reach Narvas Temple is to cross the lot, but it doesn't look like that's going to be easy.
There's a type of highly flammable flower that grows around the Tekel Shelter called Sporgimo. It could be used to set fire to the hunters' camp and lure them there. The same can be done around the scouts' defense line to distract them.
Collect Sporgimo flowers and set fire to the hunters' camp and the scouts' defense line in order to distract them. Then, make your way to Narvas Temple.
Suspicion Hauberk
Agailla Flurry was a very meticulous woman. There is no telling what she may have left there. Be sure to destroy everything you see.
And the Token?{nl}Have you not found it yet?
How can I be sure you haven't sided with Ambition Hauberk and given him the Contract Token instead?{nl}Or that you aren't plotting with Deception Hauberk to attack me?
Or, that you have found it, and are waiting to betray me, Hauberk, and take the power of Agailla Flurry for yourself!
I always suspected you would betray me, from the moment you lowered your head to another Hauberk!
I will keep my eye on you.{nl}Put one foot out of line and I will not hesitate to exterminate you.
Monk Aistis
I see Suspicion Hauberk has started to doubt his own subordinates.{nl}Seeing how he's giving orders to destroy Flurry's equipment...
If Flurry's equipment is destroyed, it will be even more difficult to modify. We must protect the equipment.
Ambition Hauberk
Transform the monks' spirits, restore my power.
What is it?{nl}What is the problem?
You better find me that monk, or you will have the same fate as them!
And what of that Contract Token?
Find it!{nl}Bring it to me before the other Hauberks get to it!
If I don't merge with them, you can be sure the bottom of the spirit engine is the last thing you'll ever see!
The lights on the devices seem to be pointing towards something.
Hauberk's hunters destroyed the equipment...{nl}But I believe we can still modify the devices and use them.
We're going to need a lot of magic crystals to modify the equipment.{nl}Please gather as many as you can from the hallway in Narvas Temple and bring them to me.
It looks like this is the right device.

Deception Hauberk
Hm...?{nl}Well, if it isn't the pitiful human again...
I would very much like to have you dragged to Ambition Hauberk and watch you suffer, but as it is, I'll be kind enough to listen to your plead. Consider it an act of mercy.
Go ahead, I'm listening.
Alright, what is it that you wish? Foolish human.
Is that so?{nl}You realized you can't defeat me and came back to beg, is it?
How unfortunate.{nl}You see, I simply cannot accept a gullible human such as yourself.
Not without the proper redemption, that is.
What are you saying?{nl}You can help me take over the other Hauberks?
You little...{nl}How do you know that function exists in the monastery?
So you discovered this information as proof of your submission to me?{nl}I don't know if I can fully trust your newfound "loyalty" just yet.
Very well. If you can restore the equipment with Monk Aistis and prove that the function exists, I'll consider it.
What?{nl}Back so soon?
Is this a plot to betray me?
Speak, human.
Have you found the Contract Token?
You say a human in the monastery is carrying the Contract Token?{nl}And they are not a monk?
They could be related to Agailla Flurry.{nl}Either way, hurry and get the Contract Token already.
So the equipment was being repaired so that Deception Hauberk could attack me?{nl}I knew I couldn't trust him.
He's very wrong if he thinks I'll let this pass.{nl}Yes, he is.
Are you saying we curse the Contract Token to attack Ambition and Deception Hauberk?{nl}Hm... Yes, if they're injured, I can merge them both into my own being.
Very well.{nl}Place the curse on the Contract Token and bring it to me.
Be sure to report back to me.
Is the Contract Token properly cursed?
At last, I can merge the other Hauberks.{nl}You have done well, King Hammer.
Report back immediately if anything happens.

What? Deception Hauberk took the monks to transform their spirits?{nl}And Suspicion Hauberk restored the monastery equipment to attack me?
How dare they betray me...!{nl}I'm sure they will try to merge me into them now.
Well, I'd like to see them try.
Prepare. If they really do have plans to attack, I shall be waiting for them!
Well done, human.{nl}Now I simply need to call for Ambition and Suspicion Hauberk.
Go and hide now. They'll suspect me if you're here.
You dare break the machines after we swore not to meddle in each other's business?{nl}I knew you would betray us.
Aren't you the one who went and repaired Flurry's equipment so you could attack me?
I have no mercy for traitors.
What are you talking about, Suspicion Hauberk?{nl}Your suspicion really knows no bounds.
How do you explain the monk you have with you?{nl}Deception Hauberk, answer me!
That... That is...
I don't need your excuses.{nl}Prepare to be merged.
Humans!{nl}Start Agailla Flurry's devices, now!
At last, I can merge you and become my own, whole being.
Do you really think you're the only one with a scheme, Deception Hauberk?
Do you think I let myself be attacked because I'm weak?{nl}Did you, for one moment, think that I would allow any of you to merge me?
If so, you are very wrong. I assumed you would betray me, so I had my men find the Contract Token.{nl}I cursed it so that whoever uses its power suffers an agony as painful as death itself.
And, wouldn't you know... you just used it.
You may feel like you're dying.{nl}But worry not. The pain will go away after I merge you.
The time has come to close the contract and fulfill my true ambition!!
Agailla Flurry Apparition
Do you really believe you honored our contract, Hauberk?{nl}You have already violated several conditions.
You agreed not to harm any humans by obtaining my staff, and you agreed not to modify in any way the staff or the Contract Token.{nl}The conditions you violated are too many for me to even mention them all.
And yet, I complied with every one of our contract's conditions. I have no reason not to confront you anymore.
Therefore, I shall stand with the Revelator, against you.
Clever, but not enough.{nl}You and your Revelator are no match for me!
Goddess Medeina's Priest Indrea
My name is Indrea. I serve Medeina, the goddess of all forests.{nl}I was looking for clues about Goddess Medeina after she disappeared during Medzio Diena, when I heard rumors of people hearing voices in Teresh Forest.{nl}I came to investigate whether they could be related to Goddess Medeina.
Really? You heard sounds coming from a tree?{nl}Can you tell me where that tree is?
I've heard others talk about humming sounds coming from the trees, but a song? That's a first.{nl}I need to investigate the lyrics of that song.
I'm fine.{nl}Are you okay, traveler?
I saw three pillars of light in different colors at Tacasz Stream. There must be something else there.
You can go ahead and investigate first.
Many say the world is falling apart.{nl}But I still believe.
We may have to fend for ourselves now, but I know the goddesses will come to save us one day.
From what I could see, we need one additional piece.
It says, "Come, take my hand. I will hand over half of my heart."{nl}Saying this sentence out loud near the butterflies might just trigger something to happen.

Hauberk's scouts are behaving as though they knew in advance that the defense barrier was down. 
Well done.{nl}Well done, my servant.
It seems you're clueless after all.{nl}Allow me, Deception Hauberk, to explain to your cowardly self exactly what happened.
Agailla Flurry agreed to grant me power, under the condition that I allow her into the Fantasy Library.{nl}I did as she requested, but when it was time for me to receive my power, I had my spirit ripped to pieces by Helgasercle instead.
She made it so that our contract could be fulfilled only if all three parts of my spirit were set free from their seals.{nl}After we were released, Ambition Hauberk, Suspicion Hauberk and I tried to restore our power through their own means.
Yet, all the other two Hauberks ever did was mindlessly destroy equipment, transform human spirits...{nl}I decided to be smarter than them.
I devised a plan to use a human familiar with the monastery in my benefit...{nl}I came across a monk lost in pain and suffering, who I hypnotized in order to use the devices.
I was using the monk to repair the temple's equipment when you appeared...{nl}With his help, you activated the protection equipment and blocked the entrance to any more of my enemies.
After that, all that was left was to modify the equipment and restore my power.{nl}You even brought me the staff Agailla Flurry had promised to me.
I do wish I could repay you for this remarkable favor, but I'm afraid a reward wouldn't do much difference in your case.
Instead, I will agree to spare your life.{nl}Consider your assistance to me an honor, and disappear from my sight.

Matador Notice Board
Matador looking for assistant.{nl}If flashy moves are your thing, come on over to Escanciu Village.
Linas
I don't think the Matador Master went anywhere too far from here.
I'm not sure where the Matador Master went, but I believe she was headed somewhere in the region of Fediman.
The Matador Master went to Fedimian.
The Matador Master said she was going somewhere north of Escanciu Village.
I did hear that the Matador Master was headed somewhere, although I can't remember exactly where she was going.{nl}I don't think she was leaving the region of Fedimian.
She had something to do in Fedimian.
Litis
I believe she was headed north.
I think the Matador Master was going somewhere in the region of Fedimian.
The Matador Master went to Fedimian to help the people there.
When the Matador Master was here we didn't have to worry about the monsters...{nl}Now that she's gone, I don't know what we'll do.
It was easy going out to gather wood when the Matador Master was here.{nl}Without her around, things get a little more difficult.
I felt a lot safer when the Matador Master was around.{nl}Ever since she left, the people at the village have been so worried.
Matador Master
The moves of a Matador can be bold and flashy, but they aren't without risks.{nl}Arrogance and low concentration are two things you have to avoid as a Matador.
So you saw my notice? Hm...{nl}I used to accept anyone as my assistance, but people had a hard time adapting to the techniques. They can get kind of difficult, not to mention dangerous.
Then I heard there was a Tetriox roaming around Fedimian, so I came thinking I could get rid of it and teach the soldiers some of my techniques, maybe look for an assistance here.
I figured someone with a military background would do better than a regular civilian.
I still need some tools to train the soldiers with, though.
I asked the merchants around here, but the tools haven't arrived yet.
Are you saying you want to help? I have nothing against that, of course.{nl}Well, first, the accessory merchant in Fedimian is going to get me something that looks like Tetriox horns.
The swords, spears and harpoons are being made by the blacksmith in Orsha.{nl}I also need some leather for the Companions to wear, so I asked the Companion Trader in Orsha for that.
Finally, the merchant in Klaipeda is making the cape we need to lure the beast.
It'd be great if you could give them a little reminder.{nl}If things work out, I'll make sure to tell you a thing or two about becoming a Matador.
You came for the thorns the Matador Master requested?{nl}Well, outside of Fedimian there's nothing but monsters.
Not only that, for the kind that she wants I need actual Blue Hohen Gulak horns.{nl}It's almost impossible to find a whole Blue Hohen Gulak horn these days.{nl}I don't know I'm supposed to finish this.
These are... Blue Hohen Gulak horns! How did you get these?
You must really be something special if you defeated a monster just for this.{nl}Thanks to your help I can finally get on with the Matador Master's request.
I'll finish the horn shape the Master wants and deliver it to her myself.
I need to find some Blue Hohen Gulak horns.
So you're here to check on the weapons I'm making for the Matador Master.{nl}Well... to make the weapons I need an ore that only exists in Nevellet Quarry.{nl}But going there is way more dangerous than I would like.
These days, not many people are willing to risk their lives going to Nevellet Quarry.
This is iron ore.{nl}Did you get it yourself?
I can't believe you got this for me.{nl}Now I can use the ore to make the weapons for the Matador Master.{nl}I'll deliver the weapons to her myself when they're finished.
I need to go find that iron ore.
This should be enough Blue Hohen Gulak horns.
So the Matador Master sent you here to bother me, did she?{nl}Well, I would love to send her the Companion armor she ordered, but I'm out of stock now.
There was a merchant called Rimantas who I used to buy them from, but we lost contact after Medzio Diena.
Last time I heard about him, he was on his way to Orsha.{nl}I don't know if he stopped by Lemprasa Pond but never arrived, or if he didn't come at all, but I couldn't find him again.
I need to find Rimantas.
Rimantas
I saw my village destroyed by monsters and left to look for a refuge.{nl}I was desperate, but thanks to the Orsha migration orders I gained some hope.
It sounds like the Matador Master is hoping for too much.{nl}In my situation, what does she expect?
{nl}I barely have enough tools to make new Companion equipment, and I have no materials at all.
I would need to find some materials, but to make something fit for the Matador Master, they need to be of excellent quality.{nl}Unfortunately, no one these days sells that kind of materials, they're too rare.
Do you really mean it?{nl}
To make the Companion armor, I need leather that's light but strong enough not to rip or scratch when attacked by monsters.
I need some Cockatrice Leather, Beetow Feelers and Minivern Skin in good condition.{nl}The problem is, since these are monster materials, they're not sold on the market.
Let me give you a note with all the materials.
You picked all these quality materials in such a short time?{nl}I can make great Companion armor for the Matador Master with these.
I'll make sure to have the Companion equipment delivered to Toras as soon as I'm finished.
I'm going to need more materials.{nl}This won't be enough for the amount of armor the Matador Master requested.
Rimantas' Note
- 50 pieces of good quality Cockatrice leather (from the Cockatrice monsters in Fedimian Suburbs){nl}- 160 sturdy Beetow feelers (from the Beetow monsters in the Klaipeda region). 
- 75 pieces of strong Minivern skin (from the Miniverns found inside the Mage Tower).
My village turned to ruins when the monsters got there.{nl}I managed to escape to the city, but now I don't really know what to do.
I didn't want to stop working, so I've been doing any sowing job that pops up.
Do you mean the Matador Master's request?{nl}Yes, I was still a little shaken after I escaped.
I was just starting to get settled when the Master came and asked me to sow the capes for her.{nl}At first I didn't want to take the order, because I have no way of getting the silk cocoons I need to make the capes.
But the Matador Master was so determined on getting her capes, in the end I couldn't refuse her.
To get the cocoons I would need to go all the way to the Emmet Forest, but these days it's just too dangerous to go outside.
Let's get some cocoons from Emmet Forest.
You brought the cocoons!{nl}I'll start working on the Matador Master's capes right away. When they're done, I'll deliver them to her myself.
The merchants told me you helped them get the materials for my requests.{nl}As promised, it's my turn to help you get into the Matador life.
Just come see me any time you want to learn.
I'll make sure to have the Companion equipment delivered to Toras as soon as I'm finished.
Hm?{nl}Are you looking for something?
A new request?{nl}Are you asking for a special kind of request?
Well, I'll let you know if any special requests come in.
May I help you?{nl}Are you looking for a special request?
I knew you'd come looking for a special request.{nl}Unfortunately I don't have what you're looking for.
You're here to ask about that special request again, aren't you?
I don't have the special request you're looking for.{nl}Try asking Receptionist Ramda, Liam or Donnes about it.
A special request came in, just like the one you're looking for.{nl}It's a request from the Buller Marker Master, but I can't tell you the details right now.
The Bullet Marker Master is at the Greene Manor, he'll tell you what you need to know.
You heard about the request from Rota, did you?{nl}Well, it's kind of a long story; do you have time?
I was in Sekta Forest with a colleague looking for gun powder materials when we saw a Blue Lepusbunny.{nl}Any other Lepusbunny would have jumped right at us, but that one just... went away.
I thought it was weird that a monster would do that, then I noticed a kind of golden dust falling off of it.
I needed to find out what that was all about.{nl}Then I thought, "If word gets out that there's a golden dust monster around, all the villagers in the area are gonna come running."
I don't want this monster hurting any greedy gold diggers, you know?
So I was wondering what to do about this monster.{nl}I noticed a few other monsters with this golden dust falling off of them: some Red Spions and Firents in Salvia Forest and Nefritas Cliff.
I just know these monsters are gonna be trouble if I don't do anything about it.{nl}So I made special bullets to make them stop spewing gold dust everywhere.
Unfortunately, things with my colleague got a little rough when I was developing the bullets.{nl}He thinks I'm gonna do something weird with the dust or something, so he wants a third party to do it now.{nl}It was kinda rude of him to suspect me, to be honest, but I agreed to hand it over to Manager Rota.
And that's why you're here.{nl}Miss anything?
Did you talk to the Bullet Marker Master?
Okay, let me give you the Master's recipes for the Frost Bullets, Fire Bullets and Lightning Bullets.
Also, the other person in charge of the request asked me to tell you to carry this surveillance orb with you at all times.{nl}Bad things will happen if you and this orb stay apart for even one moment before the mission is complete.
I would've done it myself, you know, but the other guy and I don't really see eye to eye.
You're done? Already?{nl}Man, you're a blessing.
{nl}If you had no problem making those Frost, Fire and Lightning Bullets, I'm sure you're good enough to get started on the ways of the Bullet Marker.
If you ever want to learn the ways of the Bullet Marker, you know where to find me.
Okay.{nl}Here's what you need to do.
Shoot the Frost Bullets at the Red Spions in Salvia Forest and the Fire Bullets at the Firents in Nefritas Cliff.
The Lightning Bullets are for the Blue Lepusbunny monsters in Sekta Forest.{nl}They have a strange glow going on under their feet, so you'll know when you see them.{nl}But you gotta make those bullets yourself.
My suspicious colleague gave all my bullet recipes to Manager Rota, so she's the one who has them now.
You'll need to go see Manager Rota at the Mercenary Post and get the special bullet recipes from her.
You'll need a material called Demon Magic Dust for all the bullets.{nl}There's a magic aggregator installed at the Shaton Reservoir that gives out a reddish light.{nl}Get rid of some monsters around it when the light is on and add their flesh.
Then, the flesh will come out of the aggregator as Demon Magic Dust.
For the Frost bullets you'll need Pure Frost Fragments, which you can get from Ice property monsters.
For the Fire bullets you need some Pyrite. You can buy that from the Pyromancer Master.
You're also going to need some Electric Stones from Grynas Trails, but it's hard to tell them apart from normal stones with the naked eye.{nl}You have to use this special latern I made, which makes them glow when you shine it on them.
Here's the lantern, now you only need to get the bullet recipes from Rota.
Bullet Marker Master's Memo
I wrote it all down here in case you forget.

Revelator, the one you help... is deceiving...{nl}If you follow the monk's words, Deception Hauberk will...
When you see this, go to Tiesa Hall...{nl}... Enter... completion of... Narvas Temple...
You and... the monk... helping him.{nl}If you follow him, you are... Hauberk's side.{nl}Revelator... you must escape their wicked trap... the enemy...

You were... brave and ingenious.{nl}But Hauberk's plan continues... trusting the monk...
... to defeat Hauberk, together... before he becomes his full self... His...
It's impossible to make out anything.
Obtained some Demon Magic Dust after placing the Demonic Monster Flesh.
It looks like it's turned off.
This device can no longer produce Demon Magic Dust.
All you need to do is get the monsters lured by the capote between the two pillars over there, as many as you can.
How did it go?
One moment.{nl}I'll just have a look at the surveillance orb.{nl}Hm, the requesting parties will have to see for themselves, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothing suspicious here.
Thank you very much for your hard work.{nl}You can go ahead and meet with the Bullet Marker Master now.
Rota told me you got it done.{nl}You really do have a knack for bullets, don't you? You'd make a fine Bullet Marker, as far as I can tell.
Let me know if you're ever interested.
That's it for the request. It's time to report back to Rota.
There are monsters under the stairs; wave your capote to lure them out.
There are also traps and things the monsters like spread around here and there.
That should be enough Beetow Feelers.
That should be enough Miniver Skin.
There doesn't seem to be any silk cocoons here.
That's all the silk cocoons we need.
Satisfying the need for spectacle is what we Matadors do best.{nl}Even without an audience to please, the Matador is the impersonation of that power in itself.
People see the way we move through the arena, the way look as if we're dancing, and they applaud us.{nl}
There's no iron ore around here.
That should be enough iron ore.
You have no Demonic Monster Flesh.
Neringa
You may ask Neringa five questions.{nl}You may only ask that which is you can.{nl}Neringa must answer you as is the will of Goddess Laima.
Neringa must once again answer your five questions.{nl}You may ask again now.
Goddess Vaivora and Demon Goddess Giltine became enemies after an incident in the past.{nl}It was a tragic incident which shed a light on Giltine's evil intentions.{nl}Goddess Vaivora thus swore to banish Giltine to an outer dimension.
Vaivora accuses Giltine of all evil.{nl}She believes all will be solved if Giltine is isolated from our world.{nl}Alas, Goddess Laima foresees something very different.
It is Goddess Vaivora's plan to use a Revelation to lure Giltine away from our world.{nl}Together, we must keep Vaivora's plan from succeeding.{nl}You must allow Demon Goddess Giltine to acquire the Revelation.
Neringa has come here by order of her master, Goddess Laima.{nl}Laima is certain you can accomplish Her mission.{nl}Therefore, it is Neringa's duty to assist you in realizing the Goddess' prophecy.
The Demon Goddess' Beholder has warned her that the Revelation is hidden inside the Fantasy Library.{nl}But Giltine knows that, should she attempt to enter the Library, she'll fall in Vaivora's trap.{nl}She knew Vaivora's great plan since the incident of which you do not know.{nl}She may even be certain of it now.
Giltine will mock Goddess Vaivora and send her servant into the trap.{nl}However, Vaivora will have prepared for Giltine's trick, and Giltine will fall into the trap.{nl}When she does, you must help Giltine free herself from Vaivora's trap.
I was fool to think Vaivora was giving up...
Laima's little servant, are you?{nl}You thought you could defy me like your master.{nl}Where is she now to pray for your miserable lives?
Go ahead, stop me.{nl}I would love to see you try.
So you're siding with Vaivora now...{nl}I must say, you do try.{nl}Tell me, who brought you here?
I'm warning you. You stand in my way with your goddess tricks and I swear...{nl}I'm sending you to the goddess for good.
That will not happen.{nl}Rest assured...
I am here to accompany a guest.
Neringa!
What are you doing here?{nl}Weren't you...
Oh, I see. You're here to brag about how this was all a brilliant trap you made.
Neringa is different from you.
Your duty here is complete, Beholder.{nl}You will leave soon.
Stuck up as always...{nl}I don't know what you and your goddess saw, but you can't stop Giltine now.
For a foreseeing goddess, she really is terrible at predicting how useless you are.{nl}Hahahahah.
What must happen will happen.{nl}Beholder, you have already played your part.{nl}You may go now.
You and your goddess are going to be really disappointed...{nl}Just wait and see.
And you, human.{nl}Don't even think about sticking your nose in our business.{nl}This isn't your world, understand?
The same is true for you, Beholder.
At last...{nl}Today, I dispel the shadows cast upon us.{nl}This shall be the last our world will ever see of Giltine.
She is coming.{nl}Begin.
What... what happened?{nl}Did Giltine escape my trap?!
Where is she now?
It can't be...{nl}...
Giltine can't have escaped.{nl}I must find her!
I must ask for your help once again.{nl}I must find Giltine.{nl}Please, I cannot allow her to steal those records.
Please!
The Kupoles and I prepared the most secure seal to entrap Giltine.{nl}However she saw through my plans and sent a servant in her place.{nl}But I cannot let her escape.
Giltine is after the Revelation Laima has hidden in Valandis Room 91.{nl}When she enters the room, we will activate the seal.{nl}The seal will forever imprison Giltine and the Revelation inside the room.
Do you understand?{nl}With Giltine gone from our world, there will be no need for you to collect the Revelations.{nl}Humans will be free from the threat of demons, and I and the other goddesses shall return to our due places.
Many assorted records are kept inside Valandis Room 91.{nl}I haven't had the chance to see what they contain...{nl}But I don't believe Giltine will find any clues to escape the seal in them.
I would like you to assist me in activating the seal.{nl}Return to me when you are ready.
I must say, your courage is inspiring...
I'm sure you're here for the Revelation.
I wonder what your poor goddess must be thinking.{nl}Laima, goddess of destiny.
All your petty hopes... It's all in my hands now.{nl}I cannot wait to show Laima the Revelation myself.{nl}Along with her miserable minions.
And you, human. I'm afraid this is the end of your journey.{nl}The Revelator who couldn't save the Revelation. How unfortunate!
Should I even bother with you?

This is a catastrophe.{nl}I was far too lenient.{nl}I'm certain now that Giltine's goal is to steal Laima's Revelation in Valandis Room 91.
I must stop her.{nl}I will use the Revelation to lock Giltine in Valandis Room 91.
What is this? A surprise visit?
Didn't expect to run into you here.{nl}
Oh, that human, yeah. Is that why you came to see me?
What, do you think I'm just gonna give you what you want?{nl}Not when I have the chance to get something from you.
An unknown energy is felt around the Crystal Stone. Could it be... magic?
We should be able to erase the magic now.{nl}Do it, and absorb the magic into the orb.
Demon Lord Solcomm
I had been observing you since the Crystal Stone broke, but to see you use that human...{nl}You already took what was inside the Crystal Stone. What is it that you want from me?
We finally meet. I'd say your failed attacks on the Astral Tower were bad enough of an offense, don't you think?{nl}Consider yourself lucky I'm not going to talk about all of your pathetic mistakes in front of the human.
Do your duty as a subject of Giltine and give up the contents of the Crystal Stone.{nl}It's the least you can do to save whatever's left of your dignity. 
I need the Stone to attack the Astral Tower. I will not give it to anyone without direct orders from Baiga.{nl}And I will not allow you to doubt me for even one moment. Not when I sacrificed everything I have for this attack!
This looks like a good spot to take note of the surroundings.
Oh, you're better than I though. A bomb like that is enough to destroy it, no doubt.{nl}Alright, go and destroy the Crystal Stone.
Think carefully before you receive this, as it can only be received once per team.{nl}Are you sure you want to receive this item?
Very well, it's all yours then.{nl}May it guide your new path under the goddesses' blessing.
Very well. You can take your time, there's no need to hurry this decision.
You look like you have something to ask me.{nl}Go ahead, I'll answer as best as I can.{nl}
You... saw some strange shadows at the Memorial? Hm...{nl}I can't imagine what it could be, but it's hard to be sure just from hearing about it.
Shadows... Now that I think about it, there is someone who should be able to help.{nl}Her name is Eclipse Ubik, she's the Shadowmancer Master.
She has been busy with her research. I believe she is at Lake Rasvoy.{nl}If you do see her, make sure to tell her I sent you and talk to her about the shadows.
Shadowmancer Master
Excuse me? I'm sorry, I'm very busy with work.{nl}Would you mind explaining why you're here?{nl}
The Chronomancer Master sent you? Hm... Then you must have a question for me.{nl}Very well. What is it? I'm listening.
Excuse me? I'm sorry, I'm very busy with work.{nl}Would you mind explaining why you're here?{nl}
I see. I do have an idea of what might be causing shadows like that.{nl}Unfortunately I've been far too busy with my research to do anything else.{nl}
I do have something to propose to you.{nl}If you follow along, you might learn something about that phenomenon you experienced. 
I am interested in observing solar and lunar eclipses and analyzing their effects, you see.{nl}I installed a series of devices in different locations in order to study them.{nl}
My devices need to be checked regularly, and now is the time to do it.{nl}What you will need to do is retrieve the devices, and then collect traces from nearby shadows.{nl}
Shadow traces can be collected from materialized shadows, like the ones you saw.{nl}Just as different monsters develop in different environments, shadows also look different from region to region.{nl}
To obtain the shadow traces, you need to understand the characteristics of each region's shadows.{nl}In this way, you can find more about the shadows themselves, and about the phenomenon you saw.{nl}
You must be careful not to let any devices or traces influence each other.{nl}After retrieving one set of traces, please wait some time before moving on to the next device.
If you have any questions about the characteristics of the shadows in each region, do ask.{nl}I will do my best to answer.
You did a lot better than I expected, I must say. Well done. You can hand that over to me.{nl}I need to check the results.{nl}
Hm... The results are different in one of the locations.{nl}I'm going to need to investigate further.{nl}
Thank you for your effort. Oh, and you found the cause of the phenomenon I was going to teach you.{nl}What you saw were shadows that received influence from the devices you brought to materialize themselves.
I do believe that you are fit to handle the magic of shadows.{nl}If you are ever interested in becoming a Shadowmancer, I will be here continuing my research.
It disappears when you try to touch it. What is it...?{nl}The Chronomancer Master ought to know something, let's go to Stele Road and ask her.
Are you wondering about the shadows and how they're different from region to region?{nl}Very well, what do you want to know?
The devices of Khonot Forest are south of the Valle Crossroads.{nl}
The shadows in Khonot Forest are sensitive to the presence of humans, and they will run away if you try to approach them.{nl}In order to contact them, you must become a shadow yourself.{nl}
I left a transformation device near the research device so future students could use it in my turn.{nl}The transformation devices allows you to temporarily turn into a shadow in order to approach other shadows.
Once you've transformed into a shadow, approach them and capture them.{nl}Doing this will yield shadow traces.
The device of Lhadar Forest is at the hill between Tjibes Refuge and Bethez Refuge.{nl}The shadows there usually aren't visible from up close.
Sometimes you will see the device glow with a blue light.{nl}If you activate the device then, all the shadows in the region will appear very clearly.
The influence these shadows receive plays a much larger role in how they appear compared to other regions.{nl}If you see a shadow, you should continue looking for shadows of the same influence.
Increase the influence and you will receive the shadow traces you need.{nl}That influence decreases when you capture a shadow of a different influence.
The Ziburynas device is at the Kyrba Lot.
The shadows in Ziburynas Forest are rather dull, despite what they may look like.{nl}You can easily scare them into dropping the traces you need.{nl}
Oh, but there are some who do enjoy scaring people, and they will try to scare you instead.{nl}Be careful not to fall for their pranks when you're in the region.{nl}
I understand it sounds a little unorthodox, but they're simply ways to make yourself more familiar with the shadows.{nl}Alright, you're ready to go find the traces now.
The Namu Temple Ruins device is at the Ratas Corridor Area.
The shadows you'll meet at the Namu Temple Ruins are mostly docile.{nl}Some shadows will sense your presence and disappear when you approach them.{nl}
You must step near them enough times in order to receive their traces.{nl}Although, as I mentioned, there are a few deviant ones.{nl}
Some shadows will believe you are bothering the others and they will try and capture you.{nl}They can't do much harm, but they can interfere with you finding the shadow traces if they do get a hold of you.
There's an unknown device.
The Chronomancer Master thinks the Shadowmancer Master will know about the strange phenomenon.{nl}Let's go to Lake Rasvoy and find her.
Old Machine
Found an old machine.{nl}It looks like it can still work. Try and turn it on?
Hazy Sphere
The haze in the sphere feels more and more like an evil energy.{nl}Could there be a way to remove it?
Purification Device
Found an unknown device.
The energy coming from the device is reacting with the hazy sphere.{nl}Place the sphere inside the device?
There is an opening in the center of the device.
Astral Tower Gimmick Treasure Chest
The treasure chest is locked by a divine power.
The treasure chest is no longer locked by a divine power.{nl}It looks like someone already opened it.
Star Fragment
The star fragments are beautiful.{nl}Could there be a place to collect them?
Mysterious Pot
There's a strange, old-looking pot.
Can it hold the star fragments?
It looks like a normal pot.{nl}The inside of it is pitch black.
The pot looks like it can hold the star fragments.{nl}Inspect the pot?
The pot is not reacting.{nl}It seems to react only to the star fragments.
Star Fragment
The star fragments disappeared.
Old Altar
Something seems to have been placed on the altar before.{nl}Try and place the Starlight Essence on the altar?
Castle Dungeon (Recommended Lv : 300){nl}Only you and your party members can enter together.{nl}Do you want to enter?
I'll see what I can do.
Aahh... I'm under attack.
Demon King Kartas is using the power of the Kruvina to contaminate the earth and change the very nature of this place.{nl}
This land was created after Medzio Diena. Their goal is to turn in into demon territory and create a settlement here.{nl}You must stop them.{nl}
They are launching attacks on Sorfus Coast as well.{nl}I have the Loremasters to assist me there, but things are looking bleak.
In this continent, you are the most powerful Revelator I can trust.{nl}Please, destroy the Massive Kruvina on Eperotao Coast.
The area has been occupied by the Nimrah and the Varle by order of Kartas. It won't be an easy task.{nl}{nl}That is why I trust only you to reclaim this coast from the demons.
The Massive Kruvina is protected by other demon devices and by the power of the demon lord.{nl}Loremaster Ugnius is carrying one of my relics, but its power alone will not suffice.{nl}
There is another relic of mine that has been sealed by demons in Aitheo Coast.{nl}If we can combine the power of the two relics, we can match the power of the Kruvina.
The fate of the coast lies in your hands.
The Massive Kruvina is releasing a repulsive energy.{nl}It is protected by evil power.
Zealot Master
Strong devotion does not derive from simple belief.{nl}It is only through action that true devotion is proven.
Faith, without action as commanded by the goddesses in the scriptures, is destined to perish.
Tell me, are those who find faith only in words?�the true believers?{nl}When divinity is nowhere to be found, it is our duty as believers to search for it.
It is our duty to attest our faith in the search for the divine.
You saw the tombstones in Vera Coast.{nl}Yes, Vera Coast is part of the realm of Goddess Jurate.
Are you perhaps interested in the doctrines of our order?
Us Zealots have devoted ourselves to searching for the missing goddesses after Medzio Diena.{nl}Our goal as clerics is to fulfill the will of the goddesses through whatever means necessary.
Finding the goddesses is crucial to restoring peace in our world.{nl}We will not hesitate to sacrifice whatever we must in order to find Them. That is what we are willing to do, no matter what it takes.
You seem interested in our order.{nl}I must warn you, we do not shy away from pain or sacrifice when it comes to serving the divine.
We are strongly united in our common goal, and we will perish together if we must.{nl}Are you sure you are interested in joining us?
{s33}{nl}The Zealot Order: Fervor and Devotion{/}
The Zealot order is known for its ardent sense of devotion, or as most would put it, earnest insanity.
In reality, despite their extreme ideas on devotion, Zealots hardly push the limits of what is considered acceptable under the Kingdom's laws. This is especially true when one considers the existence of cleric orders such as the Inquisitors, which are known to effectively carry out their judgment in the name of the goddesses. 
This is about a cleric order called the Zealots.{nl}Maybe an experienced cleric like the Inquisitor Master will know something more about it.
This book includes the back side of the text written on the tombstones you saw.{nl}Return to me after you read it.
I will then test your understanding of our ideology and practices.
Are you ready to prove yourself?
First, I'm going to test your understanding of our order.{nl}Please answer carefully.
What is the most important action we take in combat?{nl}What means do we use to discover the whereabouts of Goddess Laima?
Matters concerning a particular goddess are often the cause of conflict between Zealots and outsiders.{nl}What goddess is that?
Like the Zealots, there is another group concerned with searching for Goddess Jurate.{nl}Who are they?
Take your time to read the book one more time and return when you are ready.
I see you have understood.{nl}It is not a difficult book, I was right to assume you would have no trouble reading it.
I believe you are ready for your final test now.
You want to know about the Zealots?
They're an order with very radical ideas.{nl}It's safe to say they're the most extreme religious order in the Kingdom.
Mind you, that doesn't necessarily mean they're bad or a cult.{nl}They're just very drastic when it comes to exercising their devotion.
Apparently the Zealots are a very radical group.{nl}Maybe the Oracle Master will have more information on them.
The Zealots?
Yes, they're a group dedicated to searching for the missing goddesses.{nl}Their goal is to prove the existence of the divine by finding them.{nl}Laima, Jurate, and the other goddesses...
They believe in proving one's faith by acting in accordance to the will of the goddesses.
It seems their goal is to find the missing goddesses.{nl}It could be worth it to ask the Paladin Master about them.
The Zealots, you say...
Yeah, they have strong beliefs, but I think they're wrong.{nl}They'll use any means they can to find the goddesses, no matter what it is.
More than once there were clashes because of what they insisted was "following the will of Goddess Jurate".{nl}I'm telling you, their views are twisted.{nl}If you're looking for their Master, she should be at the Inner Enceinte District.
It sounds like the Zealots will do whatever it takes to follow the goddesses.{nl}It's probably best to talk to the Master herself.

Which trial are you interested in?
I will give you more time to study.{nl}You may return when you are ready.
Our order's tests are similar in nature to our regular activities.{nl}In fact, the stone plates you found were created to educate future believers.
The stone plates I will ask you to find are hidden in Cranto Coast and Igyti Seashore.{nl}They appear for 30 minutes six times per day. Return to me after you read them.
There are 10 plates in total, but only one is real.{nl}This will be a test to your knowledge and insight.
Cranto Coast and Igyti Seashore.{nl}There are 5 stone plates hidden in each location.
One of them is real and will teach you about the Zealot order. Return after you have understood the information.
The Zealot Order: Fervor and Devotion
The strong devotion that characterizes the Zealots does not currently tend to manifest itself in ways that contradict royal laws or secular standards.{nl}Historically, Zealots have accused demons as the main culprits for the disappearance of the goddesses.
In the past, this has lead Zealots to abduct a number of high-rank demons.{nl}The Zealots proceeded to torture the captured demons, interrogating them about the whereabouts of the goddesses as well as the demons' involvement in the incident.
Their practices remained largely unknown by both the Kingdom and other cleric orders. Is it thought, however, that had they been exposed, the Zealots' cruel torture tactics would have received their fair share of criticism.
In the process of capturing and torturing high-rank demons, the Zealots also committed a number of unintended assassinations.{nl}In some cases, the demons were killed during the Zealots' attempts to abduct them. Unaware of the circumstances, a small section of the general public often supported these apparently calculated murders.
Despite the minimal support obtained, the Zealots continued to be seen mostly in a negative light, which only reinforced their distance from the general population.{nl}This was all despite the fact that their actions were serving the noble purpose or regaining contact with Goddess Jurate.
Unlike Goddess Jurate's Loremasters, the Zealots were determined to solve the problem in their own radical ways.{nl}The order believed that Goddess Jurate's lack of communication was due to the fishing industry and other human intrusions to Her realm.{nl}This lead to Zealots attempting to sabotage not only fishermen, but also the royal navy, pirate crews and any human with a connection to the sea.
Although the Zealots were never entirely wrong in their interpretation of Goddess Jurate's desires, their dubious methods and refusal to adopt a more moderate stance made them generally disliked by the public.
In light of these events, the Kingdom was forced to place several legal restrictions on the Zealots' activities, which contributed to a reduced public opposition to the order, although some aversion remained.
Despite their undisputed devotion, to this day Zealots have been unable to establish themselves as a leading religious order among other clerics due to their extreme, single-minded approach to faith.{nl}It is because of this trait, however, that the order has managed to continue their activities in the Kingdom throughout the eras.
Extracted from paper by Inquisitor apprentice Thomas Iconostasis, year 1021 of the Kingdom
Zealots: A History
{s33}{nl}Zealots: A History{/}
Religious sects can be classified according to two factors: the goddess they serve, and how they serve divinity.{nl}In this aspect, our Zealot order is a rather particular case.
Our order was founded on the desire to take a stronger stance on the then-recent disappearance of the goddesses.{nl}Since the order's early days, our objective has been not to worship the goddesses, but to find Them and return them to humanity.{nl}Should the day come when all the goddesses have been found and their positions restored, it is uncertain what the role of the Zealots will become.{nl}It will be the duty of the future Zealot Master as well as the order's to follow the wishes of the goddesses regarding this matter.
Throughout the history of the Kingdom, three goddesses ??Laima, Jurate and Dahlia ??are known to have disappeared or lost their connection with humanity.{nl}A majority of the Zealot order is concerned with finding Laima and Jurate, although members devoted to Dahlia do exist.{nl}Zealots who dedicate their work to reestablishing contact with Jurate have sharply disassociated themselves from the goddess' Loremasters, of which only a few members remain.{nl}The general perception that Jurate Zealots feel superior to or even ignore Her Loremasters is therefore not entirely wrong.
Historically, the Zealot order has been unable to find support and popularity with the general public.{nl}The Zealots' limited personnel and poor financial stability has led to multiple internal conflicts over the recipients of the order's efforts.{nl}The very nature of the Zealot order, with requires extraordinarily strong will and determination from its members, has more than once been the cause of intense disagreements within the group.
One of such disagreements ultimately brought about the division of our order into two factions around the Kingdom's millennium. Surprisingly, the order was reunified 30 years later with a marriage between the leaders of both factions.{nl}Their daughter is Aliza Tal, the current Zealot Master and representative, in charge of maintaining the order's unity into the next era.{nl}Many expect Tal's term as Zealot Master to consolidate a new direction for the order, one that will ensure a bright future for Zealots after a new Master eventually takes the position.{nl}This is a particularly sensitive issue for Zealots, with the impending generation shift from the supporters of Tal's parents to their own succeeding members of the order.{nl}Ultimately, then, the success of the Zealot order unification will depend on how Aliza Tal approaches her duty as Master, guided by the legacy of her parents.
Fortunately for the order, Aliza Tal has demonstrated excellent conduct in her term as Zealot Master, earning the trust of not only Zealots but other clerics as well.{nl}One could say that, as an order specialized in the search of absent divinity, now more than ever the Zealots possess a relative advantage to other cleric groups that may very well contribute to their growing status in society. 
Zealots and Divine Power
{s31}{nl}Zealots and Divine Power{/}
Like their history and personality, the Zealots' views on divinity are characteristically different from those of other clerics.{nl}Unlike cleric orders which approach and use the divine power of the goddesses through prayer or ceremonies, Zealots, who are devoted to searching for the missing goddesses, rely on no divine figure from which to borrow their power.
As the affiliation to multiple religious sects is not forbidden under the Kingdom's law, Zealots are allowed to use the power of other goddesses to pursue their activities.{nl}This, however, is a rare occurrence, given the Zealots' strongly independent and determined religious mindset.
One method the Zealots have found to circumvent this limitation was to create their own kind of self-sacrificial rite.{nl}The very designation of this method may sound daunting but, to put it simply, Zealots do this by sacrificing their life energy and similar forces to invoke a new power.
As such, although unable to directly use the power of the goddesses, the Zealots' rites allow them to make use of a universal divine power connected to that of the goddesses, or the inherent divine force of the world itself.
Sensing and utilizing this universal divine power are abilities exclusive to those of the Zealot order. This is often presented by Zealots as definitive proof that, despite their lack of direct communication with the goddesses, they remain a recognized cleric order in the eyes of the divinities.
On the other hand, the Zealots' methods of manifesting their abilities by sacrificing life energy and related components are, to this day, not generally accepted among the public or other cleric orders.
The Zealot order itself has shown no intentions of revising its practices, which seems to indicate that it will continue to stand by the uncompromising, self-segregating stance it is known for in the eras to come.
What can I do for you?
Is there anything you need?
This looks like the tombstone the Zealot Master talked about.
This stone says something different from the book.
Part of the content is erased, making it hard to read.
The text is about religious orders.
This stone filled with small text looks a little suspicious.
Found the stone. It's time to return to the Zealot Master.
You found it.{nl}Congratulations, you passed the first test.
The content you read is about the history of our order.{nl}We must understand our own history so that we may continue it.
Take this book and read it again.{nl}Return to me after you understand it.
Are you ready to answer a few questions about 'Zealots: A History'?
Think carefully before you answer.
The Zealot order is comprised or two large factions and one smaller faction.{nl}What is the smaller faction?
In the past, our order was divided into two due to an internal conflict.{nl}When did this happen?
What characterizes the stance of our order?
It seems you have sufficient understanding of our history and future.{nl}You're ready for the next test.
You may return to me when you are ready.
Very well, let's begin the final test.{nl}The basis of this test won't be too different from the last.
Find the order's hidden tombstones in Nheto Forest, Svalphinghas Forest and Lhadar Forest.{nl}This time as well, there are 5 per location, only one of them real.
The content of the stone is related to our devotion and use of divine power.{nl}You may start now.
Nheto Forest, Svalphinghas Forest, Lhadar Forest.{nl}There are 15 tombstones, but only one contains true information about our relation with divine power.
You read the last piece of literature.{nl}The first and last pieces were written by an Inquisitor of the Kingdom.
He was not a member of our order, but he studied it and understood it.{nl}We use his book to educate newer members.
I will give you the full book for you to read.{nl}You can return to me when you are ready.
I have one last test for you.{nl}These will be questions about our divine power and the goddesses.
As you know, us Zealots are different from other clerics.{nl}How are we different?
From which goddess do Zealots borrow their divine power?
Through what means do we use our powers as clerics?
What kind of divine force serves as a source for our power?
You have passed the final test.
You have a fine understanding of our history and future objectives.{nl}That knowledge is vital to becoming a true Zealot.
And finally, a Zealot must be faithful and devoted to the order's goals.{nl}You must be determined, even if it destroys you...
If you are sincerely willing to become a member of our order, I as Zealot Master will duly allow it.
The dungeon isn't open now.{nl}You can enter every hour from :00 to :14 minutes.
Laima's One Thousand Years Vol. 1
Eyes open, Laima tried to collect Herself, consciously allowing peace to return to Her.{nl}It was not easy foreseeing in detail all the strings of destiny that were yet to unfold. Before the future happens, there is always the faint chance that it can be changed. But destiny always comes, and when a moment inevitably approaches, it becomes only more difficult to avoid.
Being a goddess did not free Her from the Creator's universal laws. If anything, as a guardian of those laws, She was bound to them more than anyone.{nl}Laima, however, was determined to take action. Time wasn't scarce according to Her premonition, but knowing the future was not enough to reassure Her. Not considering the opponent she was set to face.
Laima knew all too well the thousand-year regret of letting go and missing the chance to change the future.{nl}So She prepared, careful enough not to hurry, but hasty enough not to delay Her plans.
Laima took one last look at the home She had grown so attached to in the past years, the same one She was now determined to abandon.{nl}If what She foresaw was to happen, or because it was to happen, it would be another thousand years before She would return.{nl}And so She tried, though She knew it was in vain, to imprint into Her memory the feel of that place, hoping it would carry out into the long, long millennium.
Her absence would last no longer than a thousand years, of that She was certain.{nl}With a deep sigh, Laima raised Her hand and began to mark on the walls a message, as if writing with light.{nl}Each message engraved would soon fade into the walls without a trace. For Laima, there was nothing left to do then but leave.
With Laima gone, Her estranged sister Giltine would be the first to visit Her abandoned home, or so she foresaw.{nl}One of the messages left engraved on the walls was directed to her, in the hopes that Giltine would abide by it.{nl}Laima felt sorry for the situation She had placed Herself into. Eventually, however, She stepped away from home, and Her thousand-year journey began.
Laima's One Thousand Years Vol. 2
Giltine stood in the abandoned home of Goddess Laima. A message, clearly directed to her, appeared briefly on the wall before fading back into nothing. Giltine meditated on the words. Unlike humans, she was unable to forget anything her eyes had seen.{nl}Her thoughts turned to words in her mind before she voiced them out, at once enraged and insulted.{nl}[So you left without even bothering to speak to me. You still think you are right, don't you?]{nl}
She continued. [You knew that we would never agree on this, that I would come find you if everything fell through, so you prepared to abandon this place? The place we call our home?]{nl}Giltine's monologue turned into an angry lament. [You're going to roam with the humans now? You're leaving me, making me the enemy? You're running away from the other goddesses, your sisters, to live like that for who knows how long?]{nl}
As soon as her words dissipated, Giltine heard a noise coming from behind her.{nl}She turned around to glance at the three demons that had arrived under her command.{nl}On the left stood Kartas; his skin pale and ashy, his deranged eyes glistening.{nl}Knowing him, Giltine believed he might very well be able to chase Laima. Kartas was chaos personified after all, there was no telling what he was capable of. Counting on his tenacious and uncontrolled nature, Giltine knew it was only a matter of time before he could find Her.
On the other hand, Kartas hunted for pleasure and thoroughly enjoyed wreaking havoc. Laima would not die at the hands of Giltine's subordinate, but his destructive impulses seemed like too much of a risk.{nl}She erased from her mind the thought of entrusting Kartas with the goddess. Instead she turned to Baiga, her most trustworthy subordinate. Baiga was discreet, intelligent and powerful, a rare combination among Giltine's followers. Short of a true goddess herself, she knew not to expect perfection from her subordinates. Baiga, however, would not disappoint her.{nl}Capturing a goddess with foreseeing powers would be no easy task. It could take centuries to find Her. And yet, to an immortal being it was not impossible, and Giltine was willing to bet on Baiga to produce the right results.{nl}Unfortunately for her, there was a bigger, more urgent task reserved for Baiga that she could not entrust to anyone else.
 Conformed, Giltine turned her eyes away from Baiga and onto her third demon.{nl}[Gesti, I want you to chase Laima. Do what you must to find her. I will not tolerate a failure.]{nl}Upon hearing Giltine's words, Baiga acquiesced. Kartas clenched his teeth and growled loudly in discontent, gazing intently at his superior. Gesti stepped back on one foot, as if preparing for him to suddenly attack.{nl}Predictably, Kartas seemed fixed on the thought that he would have been chosen for the job if it weren't for Gesti. As someone who did not hesitate to defy Giltine herself, he was remarkably less keen on respecting her other subordinates as fellow demon lords.
Giltine let out a deep sigh and adopted a rigid stance, glancing back at Kartas. A few moments passed before he looked away in defeat. As always, the only way to control Kartas was to overpower him into submission. Other than the goddesses, few were able to do that without collateral damage.{nl}
Now regretting ever having considered Kartas for the important task of finding Laima, Giltine adjusted her posture to speak again.{nl}[Kartas, you stay away from Gesti. You don't want to know what I'll do with you if I catch you out of line. You go to Gesti only if she asks for your help. Do as she says or you will be punished. I will not hesitate to take you down.]{nl}
Kartas slowly lowered his head, signaling to Giltine his obedience. No words were directed to Gesti.{nl}If needed, she would call for Kartas or his subordinates. He may not have been as brilliant as Baiga, but Gesti was no fool either. She would be careful not to assign Kartas too big of a role, or push him to the point of releasing his explosive nature.
 Gesti pondered on what task she could entrust to Kartas. Giltine stepped towards her, as if guessing her thoughts.{nl}[Let us leave, before the goddesses realize we came to find Laima.]{nl}Without further discussion, the four demons walked away from the scene, leaving Laima's home empty once again.
Laima's One Thousand Years Vol. 3
Gesti was certain Laima remained unaware of her plot. The goddess, on the other hand, had long predicted her actions, and was now more infuriated than ever with the demon's sheer audacity to follow through with them. Laima felt deceived. She felt as if Gesti was infringing the most basic of rules, even if no such rules existed for the demon. That fact only added to Laima's bitter indignation.
Unfortunately for Gesti, not all would go according to her plans.{nl}"How dare you use humans... How dare you even consider associating with those humans!"{nl}
Gesti was certain Laima remained unaware of her plot.

She felt as if Gesti was infringing the most basic of rules, even if no such rules existed for the demon. That fact only added to Laima's bitter indignation.
Gesti was entirely uninterested in human politics: who the ruling dynasties were, how the Kingdom was founded, all of it. This was true even after she discovered that Laima had contacted with Zachariel, their founding king.{nl}The goddesses often communicated with their believers, the Kingdom's clerics, through prayer and apparitions. Gesti found this behavior unnecessary, though she was aware of the others' commitment to it.
As Laima immediately met with Zachariel after escaping, Gesti merely saw it as a mundane visit rather than an act of despair.{nl}When she finally understood, the mortal king was already at rest in his tomb. With him, Laima had buried in the royal mausoleum a Revelation containing part of Her powers.{nl}Gesti hurried to the tomb when she realized it, but on arriving she discovered something even more unexpected. The mausoleum was protected by a defense system so sophisticated not even a powerful demon such as herself could ignore it.
King Zachariel had mobilized all of the Kingdom's cleric forces to build a protection system for the mausoleum using the divine power of the goddesses.{nl}With time, the barrier would fade and slightly weaken, but at that moment, Gesti knew it was far too powerful to penetrate, and it angered her beyond words.{nl}She hated being forced to admit it, but she could not overlook the shame of having been outsmarted by Laima. She knew the goddess would continue to rely on humans to stop her, that She would find another way to make them work in Her favor.{nl}But Gesti was determined to carry out her task, through whatever means necessary.
If Gesti was to galvanize large groups the way Laima did, she was going to need help.{nl}She summoned her subordinates. Then, with the authority granted to her by Giltine, she called for Kartas' and Baigas' henchmen.
Gesti saw no reason to hold back from gathering her own demon army if Laima was doing the same with the humans. It was an opportunity to prove themselves superior to their tactics.{nl}Rexipher was the first to answer Gesti's call. Out of her own nine subordinates, she trusted him the most to infiltrate the mausoleum and retrieve the Revelation. If necessary, there were always other demon lords she could rely on for the task, she thought.
Gesti explained the details of the task to Rexipher before dismissing him and the rest of the henchmen. Neither of them could have imagined the thousand-year-long ordeal that task would become. No one but Laima had foreseen the true scale of their situation.
Eminent Vol. 1
A young man walked down the street with steady, cheerful steps. Locals recognized him as the son of their lord and greeted him politely. He responded to each with a kind smile and a friendly word or two. The young man was exceptionally well-mannered for someone of his noble status, which made him a widely respected figure among the people living in his father's lands.
He was particularly remembered for having saved multiple lives during an epidemic that had spread over the region the previous year. The disease took the lives of all his brothers and sisters, leaving only his ailing father and himself in the family. Most believed that, if it weren't for his son's devoted care and attention, the lord too would have perished from the epidemic. Assured by the young nobleman's selfless and respectful nature, the inhabitants of the land looked forward to the day he became his father's successor.
Now the sole descendant of the Eminent family, the young man carried his benevolent ways inside the residence, treating servants and guests alike with utmost kindness.{nl}One day, he carefully entered his father's room and dismissed the servants. The amicable smile soon disappeared from his features. He made sure they were out of hearing distance before drawing closer to the bed.{nl}[They know about my dedication and care now. More than enough, in fact. I think it's time for you to go.]{nl}The lord responded in a strained voice.{nl}[Why must you do this with our family...?]
The young man replied.{nl}[What do you mean? I'm going to bring true prosperity to your family, I'm going to make your name known. If anything, you should be thanking me for even having chosen you.]{nl}
[Please, stop trying. What is it that you want to reveal about my true identity? Other than me not being human, you know nothing.]{nl}[What are you?]{nl}[You will die soon, so I will not hide it. I am what you call a demon. A demon lord. I shall not reveal my true name. It is enough for you to know the name of Eminent, your family. When you die, there will be no more Eminents and no more unrest, no more disorder.]{nl}[Why are you after the lands and authority of a human?]{nl}[I have my reasons, but there is no need or time to elaborate.]{nl}Uttering these words, the young man reached out with his hand and lightly touched the other. He was still breathing slowly, his eyes closed. Later, with the servants back in the room tending to him, he would have his last breath. But not now.
The man now set to become the only remaining member of the Eminent family took a few moments to organize his thoughts.{nl}After being tasked with finding Laima's Revelation and realizing the ways in which the goddess had used humans in Her favor, he was determined to plot his own scheme of human domination.
It would seem odd, that the ingenious Rexipher had wasted centuries surrounding that royal mausoleum before considering the thought of infiltrating the humans' society. On the other hand, the fact that he unlike other demons had even conceived such a plan was remarkable, given their proud and reluctant personality.{nl}He didn't know it yet, but his plan would become the foothold to, years later, defeating Laima's chosen guardian for the first time in history.
Eminent Vol. 2
For the first time after Gesti discovered Laima's plans to hand Her Revelations over to posterity, the keeper of a Revelation had been murdered by a demon. Others had been sent by Gesti to complete that very mission, but Premier Eminent had been the first to succeed.
As Lydia Schaffen's arrow burried itself into Ruklys' neck, Premier Eminent looked ready to shout out, 'I won!,' but he did not say a word.{nl}After disguising himself as a human and monopolizing the Kingdom's government from his political position, this was an important victory.{nl}His only grudge was failing to defeat Schaffen and Maven. Their names were far too powerful for him to attempt it without great risks.{nl}With Ruklys gone, all that was left to do was find the Revelation he was guarding. One word to poor King Kadumel was enough to grant Eminent full control over the operations.
He looked set to accomplish the enormous feat of becoming the first demon to seize Laima's Revelation.{nl}Suddenly, Lydia Schaffen made her way towards him. His human self was older than her, but he made the effort to address the acclaimed archer in his usual polite tone.{nl}[I was always sure you would be the one to capture the rebel leader. No general, no officer of the Kingdom but you, Lydia.]{nl}Lydia gave one look at the cunning politician before sighing deeply.{nl}[Next time you can believe I will be keeping my eyes on you. I don't care where you are or what you're doing, you won't be so safe anymore as long as I'm around. Mark my words.]{nl}Had another human spoken to him so brazenly, he would not have hesitated to retaliate. With Lydia, he merely maintained his unassuming expression of years trained in human interaction and spoke in a soft tone.{nl}[You are as proud as the one you killed today, I can tell. I should say, however, that one does not reach my position without a certain level of... competence.]
Eminent and Schaffen peppered their words with the right amount of ambiguity. Their conversation was less and less a dialog between two humans. Lydia spoke next.{nl}[I knew a fool who used to say that... He's still up there, riding my arrow. I don't know if you know him.]{nl}It was true. No demon ??neither the fool she spoke of, nor the highest of demon lords ??had ever crossed her path and survived. Eminent found it hard to believe that would be his fate but, even with his immense power, Lydia was far from an easy target.
Not only that, if there was any human capable of destroying a demon lord, the woman standing in front of him was certainly one of them. Her mentor Maven, on the other hand, was a high-ranked cleric who would stop at no means to defend himself from the demons.
Eminent decided not to respond to Lydia's provocation. In his human form of chancellor Eminent, he was in no way related to her sharp arrows.
Lydia Schaffen's strategy, however, was not to fight physically.{nl}[Do you really think you'll get what you want now that Ruklys is dead? Have you forgotten that I was given the same divine task? If there was any chance of it getting to your hands, do you think he would have died at mine? Your plan will never work. You can be sure of that. But it's time for me to go now. Do me a favor when you deliver the news to His Majesty. Make sure everyone understands exactly what I did.]
Lydia Schaffen bowed and slowly walked away. Eminent wasn't too concerned yet. True despair wouldn't come for him until 10 days later.
Eminent Vol. 3
Emiment kneeled silently before Gesti. They were on the Fortress of the Land Ruklys had once built. Looking down at Eminent, Gesti spoke with despise.{nl}[You scoured through every body of every miserable human in here for years, and you can't tell me where in this fortress it's hidden?]{nl}Eminent replied in an almost inaudible voice.{nl}[Forgive me.]{nl}In his mind, he wondered for a moment if Baiga would have understood his situation better than Gesti. She interrupted his train of thought immediately.{nl}[What are you going to do about it? You're a chancellor to those humans now. If the King calls you back to the court, how are you going to keep looking for it? Huh? Look at you. Does it look like you did a good job, playing human like that? What good is it now, if you can't even do you real job?]{nl}
Eminent could no longer stand listening to Gesti berate him in silence.{nl}[As chancellor I have authority over many human subordinates, including armies. Even if I return to the capital, I can send soldiers under my orders to continue looking...]
Angered, Gesti spoke over him.{nl}[And start depending on those filthy humans again? You couldn't find it, but you think they can? What are you even thinking??]{nl}Seeing the ire in Gesti's eyes, Eminent lowered his head. She continued.{nl}[You've been living with them for too long. I want you to stop playing chancellor and focus on your job for once. Just find me the Revelation]{nl}Eminent rushed to answer.{nl}[I remind you that my position would be very useful for keeping humans away while we're searching. I can have the measures taken under my orders, then kill my human character and return to this place immediately to continue the search. Please, allow me to do so.]
Gesti wasn't overly pleased with Eminent's plan, but she agreed to it.{nl}[You were the first to kill Laima's chosen keeper, I suppose. I'll allow it.]{nl}Hearing Gesti's voice soften, Eminent pushed for a second request.{nl}[I have only one more thing to ask.]{nl}[What is it?]
Premier Eminent thought carefully on how to convey his second request to Demon Lord Gesti.{nl}[Many of Ruklys' followers are still living in a city near the fortress called Roxona. My soldiers have been keeping guard at the fortress for now, but they can't do that forever. If we let them be, his followers will try to invade the fortress. But I also can't arrest an entire city...]{nl}[Spare me the details of human society. Just say what you want to do.]{nl}[If you could destroy the city with your powers...]{nl}[Why don't you do it yourself?]{nl}[I certainly could, with the right amount of preparation and the right tools. But annihilating an entire city would call the attention of the goddesses. And then there's the agreement...]{nl}[Didn't you kill everyone in that noble family to get to your position? The goddesses didn't do anything then, why would they care now? I doubt they'll even find out about it.]
Eminent replied.{nl}[Those humans died from an epidemic. It's true that I created the disease and made it spread, but ultimately I didn't kill them. The locals saw me as a virtuous man. Not to mention the scale of that was much smaller than an entire city. This will be a much more serious violation of the agreement in the eyes of the goddesses.]
Gesti was engrossed in her thoughts for a moment. To her, humans were of no particular interest. The same could not be said about the goddesses. Knowing the next step of Giltine's great plan, she did not want to provoke them. But most of all, there was the agreement that could not be broken by either side. They had apologized for minor transgressions before, but to completely disregard the agreement was yet out of the question.
Gesti finally spoke again.{nl}[Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to cast a petrifying curse on the city. In theory, the humans can return to normal when the curse is broken, so they won't be dead. Meanwhile, you can use your authority in the human Kingdom to move the petrified ones to another location. That will keep them away without us needing to kill them. Whatever happens next will be the work of the humans, meaning Zemyna as well will be less likely to suspect us.]
{nl}[Understood. If we can also convince the humans that it's a curse from the goddesses, like the rumors about Ruklys, I don't think anything can stop this plan.]
[You can take care of that yourself, just focus on the goal. Remember, we're not trying to kill Laima's chosen keepers; what we want is the Revelations and nothing more. Be grateful that Giltine hasn't punished you yet, and work harder to finish your job. That's what you really ought to do.]{nl}With these words, Gesti disappeared.
Premier Eminent was finally able to stand again. He was burdened with a heavy task. He did not know yet about the long years he would spend inside that fortress, never reaching success. If he did know, he would have perhaps been slightly consoled by the fact that Laima had been left deeply grief-stricken after Ruklys' death under his false accusations. In the conflict between goddesses and demons, that too was a victory.
Fantasy Library Administration Guidelines
The Fantasy Library is the sacred property of the goddesses, wherein all the knowledge and information of the world is kept. Under the administration of Goddess Vaivora, Library management Kupoles are to understand and abide by the following principles.
1. Every new work of literature must be read and understood by she who is the first to find it. The Kupoles must periodically exchange newly acquired information, and relay it to Goddess Vaivora if proven true by the Library's records.{nl}2. Documents legible only to select Kupoles must be duly investigated for the conditions which restrict said legibility. If no definitive conditions are found, the work must be registered as undefined.
3. Should a document be found missing or in a different location, the Kupoles must be alerted and the document periodically investigated for new or undiscovered conditions of existence.{nl}4. The Kupoles must maintain the Library's documents correctly registered and organized, with any information easily accessible to Goddess Vaivora. This principle should take priority over any other, with the exception of the Library's security.
The Story of Mirtis
Years had passed since Gesti sent her demon lords after Laima, yet they had all failed to find Her. Chasing a goddess that could see into the future was far from an easy task, but lately they had made considerable progress in tracking Her steps.
Eminent was certain Laima had become restless after her chosen keeper Ruklys was assassinated. Mirtis thought otherwise.
It was reasonable to think Laima was slowly losing her powers after creating the first Revelation. Mirtis believed the demon lords were closer to Her than ever before. For one, they had almost caught the goddess in Siauliai Woods. They had since lost track of Her again, but they were confident She was near.{nl}Mirtis, in particular, possessed a means for reconnaissance other demons did not. She had found Laima accompanied by a man in a human prison, and there too she had nearly caught Her.{nl}None of the demon lords, however, had come close enough to Laima to properly confront Her.
Mirtis saw their progress as a positive sign; she was certain She would not escape their grip for much longer. She knew from the glimpses she took of Her that Laima had assumed the form of a weak human child. She did not look as if She could withstand an attack if she were to confront Her.
And so, when Laima was finally sighted in the Crystal Mine, Mirtis hurried to inspect the location for possible escape routes.{nl}She couldn't rule out the possibility of Her using teleportation to flee, either. She modified the mine walls to collapse on any signs of teleportation. Anyone attempting it would become trapped in the mine before they had the chance to escape.{nl}Realizing there were no means left for Laima to exit the mine, Mirtis felt assured and excited.
Perhaps because of this, Mirtis had failed to notice the man that accompanied Laima until She came into sight. She was ready to address Her.{nl}[At last, I become the one to stand before you. Other demon lords have chased your path, only to abandon it without ever seeing your shadow. But now you're here. The curtain has fallen.]{nl}It wasn't Laima, but Cunningham, the man beside Her, who replied.{nl}[Did it cross your mind that we could be the ones waiting for you?]
Mirtis retorted.{nl}[Insolent. Whether you waited for me makes no difference. Our matters do not pertain to you, human. What makes you believe you have the right to impose yourself?]
Mirtis shifted her attention from Cunningham to Laima.{nl}[I have received orders from Giltine to strongly encourage you to surrender the Revelation. Should you refuse, it is my duty to seize it through whatever means necessary. Let us make a peaceful agreement. I am willing to be courteous.]
Laima was once again silent. It was Cunningham who continued.{nl}[We waited for you here precisely because we can no longer escape. Although, if you didn't know yet, this mine has been excavated for centuries.]{nl}[That means...?]{nl}Cunningham replied before Mirtis could finish her sentence.{nl}[It's an old, old mine. The lots with no more crystals are already closed. Even if one collapsed, no one would know someone was ever there, and certainly no one would ever dig there again on purpose.]{nl}[And...?]
Cunningham had his answer ready.
In that moment, the 4 Divine Orbs were used for the first time in history. In the future, they would help fight against the great World Tree disaster. The Divine Orb of Rimgaudas, the first Paladin Master, would also contribute to defeating Mirtis' master Gesti not too far from there. But in that moment, it was Mirtis who fell victim to the Orbs first powerful attack.
Mirtis tried to move, but she realized she no longer felt the passing of time around her. If time was a stream, it now felt like a pond. If time was freezing, she thought, she would move through space. But space, too, had been blocked ??by herself just a few moments earlier, no less. She could do nothing but stay there, unable to move.
She would have tried to escape the influence of the Divine Orb before time stopped still, but her mind, too, was now slowing down to the point where she could no longer control it.{nl}Cunningham waited until she became completely motionless and commented.{nl}[The power of this Orb is remarkable.]{nl}Laima finally replied.{nl}[It is because I am near it. If a human uses it alone, it will not be as powerful.]{nl}[This awful demon isn't going anywhere for a while, that's what's important. But you ought to hurry now. I can take it from here.]{nl}[I would prefer if you did not have to do it.]{nl}[I must. You know so. If the mine isn't destroyed, there's always the chance that other demons, or even humans, can wander upon this place. Not only that...]
Cunningham paused to ponder on his words.{nl}[Not only that, the Orb is set to reappear at a different location after its owner's death. It was you who said so. We mustn't let the Orb stay here, for the sake of our future. If I die here, the Orb will be gone and we will have achieved our goal. I'm certain Ruklys would have approved. He can't have died for the goddesses in vain!]
Grief washed over Laima at the mention of Ruklys' name and she finally agreed with Cunningham. She blessed his noble sacrifice and left the mine. In Her remained the deep sorrow of the memories She had sought to forget.{nl} 
Gesti and Ausura
Gesti worried. She worried constantly about her failed attempts to track down Laima, the important task Giltine had assigned for her, but this time, there was something else on her mind. Kartas, forever under the direct orders of Giltine, was unlikely to be sent our to help her, but she may have to deal with Demon Lord Nebulas, his subordinate. Gesti was not looking forward to that.
Unlike Kartas, Nebulas was virtually uncontrollable. More often than not, his appetite for violence did nothing to help the task at hand. For now, however, she had little choice.
She could not summon another demon lord for the sole purpose of keeping Nebulas on a figurative leash. Neither could she discard Nebulas or return him to Kartas. In the end the fact remained that, without a powerful demon on her side, getting hold of the Revelation seemed all but impossible.{nl}The only way she saw was to have Nebulas regulate his own temper. Gesti was in the middle of agonizing over how to get the unruly demon to behave when she heard steps coming in her direction.{nl}[Master. What is it that occupies your mind?]
The words belonged to Ausura, a demon lord who took orders exclusively from Gesti. Along with Diena Frieblander, Ausura was one of the helpers created by Gesti to manage the demon realm in her absence. She served also as Gesti's advisor, and she was known to be a very devoted demon.{nl}That day, like most other days, she listened carefully to the master's woes before offering her word of advice.
[Would it perhaps be best not to summon him? He is dangerous. If you consider his nature, he seems far more likely to hinder rather than contribute to your goal. There's no telling the sort of damage he could cause.]{nl}[Unfortunately I can't leave him alone, either.]{nl}[Luckily, Nebulas is not without his interests. If you remember, Kartas erased his memories when he created him. Because of this, he is obsessed with finding details of his previous life. Surely that can be used to control him.]
[It's nothing I haven't thought about myself. The problem is that I can't give him what he wants.]
[Perhaps not immediately, but in the future. I will make it my task. Kartas is not the most thorough of personalities, after all. With the right amount of research, I'm sure I will find something he wants. For one, there is the fact that Kartas has kept Nebulas from his memories all along. No other demon lord has ever dared to cross Kartas' will in favor of Nebulas, but if I were to intervene, uncovering the clues of his past would only be a matter of time.]
[Are you willing to do that?]{nl}[In your name, master, yes. For now, I advise you to keep Nebulas under control. He should be released only in circumstances where he cannot compromise the task. Do not worry about him, master.]{nl}Gesti accepted the advice of her loyal servant. Thus the role of Karta's subordinate Nebulas in the search for the Revelation was delayed until what would be known in future eras as Medzio Diena.
Nebulas and Kalejimas
Nebulas found himself suppressing the desire to attack the demon lord standing in front of him. He composed himself as best as he could before finally addressing Ausura.{nl}[So you're saying you found out what I wanted to know, but you're only telling me now.]{nl}Ausura sensed his hostility, but tried to remain collected.{nl}[That information was of no use to you before today, you see.]
[There's no reason I couldn't have gone there before. Wouldn't have been that big of a problem for our masters.]{nl}[I do believe it would have hindered the work we are doing for our masters. However I see no obstacles to it now. I would assume you are free to move there as you wish.]{nl}[It's in Kalejimas, is it?]
[That is correct. Although I must remind you. You mustn't act solely in your own interests. It is extremely important that you retrieve the Revelation that is guarded inside.]{nl}[I know.]{nl}[After all, this is a unique opportunity for yourself. Do not be ungrateful for what destiny has brought you.]{nl}
[If what you say is true, shouldn't you have told me that sooner?]{nl}[Only now are the humans occupied in dealing with the disaster. Intervening any sooner would have been too great of a risk.]{nl}[So now I can go find the man in Kalejimas and get the information from him, is it?]{nl}[I must remind you, the keeper of the Revelation as well is or was previously in Kalejimas. Do not forget that.]
[I know. But there's something I don't understand. It makes sense that the man who was in charge of the records of all of the Kingdom's families would know about my ancestors and who I was as a human, but wouldn't that information also be in the actual records? It can't all be in his memory...]{nl}
[Of course. But as you know, the humans' Kingdom is already in ruins. Retrieving specific documents would become an even more difficult task.]{nl}[That's because you wasted all this time without telling me!]
Ausura tried as she could to appear indifferent while Nebulas burned with rage.{nl}[I understand that you're agitated, but there is a riot happening at Kalejimas as we speak. If you're to gain any control there, you must hurry.]{nl}[But if this man I'm going to find is no longer working at the records, then who's in charge of them now? Are they still alive? Are you just keeping more information from me?]
Ausura sighed at Nebulas' relentless suspicion.{nl}[The human in charge of the records lived in the capital before the great disaster. However, I must warn you not to go there. These are Gesti's orders. You must focus on Kalejimas. Do not attempt to investigate other locations or engage with any other humans. The chances of discovering any traces of old documents in the Fallen City are minimal. Your only sure lead now lies in Kalejimas.]
Nebulas, refusing to let Ausura have the final word, threw at her one last question.{nl}[Your boss won't say anything if I have it my way in Kalejimas, will she?]{nl}Ausura's response was harsh.{nl}[Gesti has no interest in whatever havoc you wreak there, so long as you retrieve the Revelation.]{nl}
The Story of Solcomm
[Have you called?]{nl}Demon Lord Solcomm stood in front Gesti, the one who had summoned him. Waiting for her reply, he realized once again the complexity of his situation. Formally, he was a servant of Kartas. His work, however, was largely dedicated to Baiga. And yet there he was, awaiting orders from Gesti. A devoted agent for all three of those high-rank demons.
Solcomm's ordeal began with Baiga designating him to work for Kartas in order to spy on the rival demon king. Giltine, their master, had promptly agreed to Baiga's proposal, thinking a reasonable demon such as Solcomm would do well to prevent Kartas' incontrollable nature from getting out of hand.
Some centuries later, Gesti was tasked with chasing Laima, and Giltine allowed her to request the help of other demon lord subordinates, Solcomm included.{nl}The decision did nothing to improve Solcomm's situation. His master used the constant "support missions" and "dispatched operations" as an excuse to achieve what was essentially discarding his least favorite henchmen. Not only that, as the most normal and rational of the lower-ranked demon lords, Solcomm was the obvious choice for Gesti.
A stubborn, deranged character like Warpulis would be of no help to the task at hand.
Having Nebulas around was more than enough. In the end, it was up to Solcomm to accept the new role under Gesti, now his third master.{nl}In the centuries to come, answering to three masters was bound to do more harm than good, he thought. It lowered the chances of any of them truly supporting him.
 His current master Gesti was, unsurprisingly, beginning to show signs of just that. She addressed him.{nl}[Do you know how long we've been looking for Laima's Revelation? It's bad enough that we haven't made any progress, and it's only going to get worse.]{nl}[Why is that?]{nl}[Ever heard of Lydia Schaffen?]
[Yes, I've heard of her. She is exceptionally well-known in the human realm. I don't believe any human in history, not even her mentor Maven, has ever become quite as influential as she.]{nl}[I didn't know you were so keen on human gossip. But alright. What's important is that this woman is guarding Laima's Revelation. And you know what's funny? We know she has it, but we can't even touch her. Every other keeper of a Revelation was either hiding it or protecting it, or at least doing something to keep it off our hands. Maven, the one they call her mentor, is locked inside the Great Cathedral with a Revelation. Tesla, well, he lived for way too long not to be hiding his own Revelation somewhere. His statues are almost as powerful as the goddesses themselves. Even if I catch him, how am I going to interrogate him?
The Beholder thinks Tesla has no Revelation. But Lydia Schaffen is different. This woman is different, I'm telling you.]{nl}Solcomm interceded before Gesti's explanation could get any longer.{nl}[She is different, indeed. She defeated six demon lords in the past 27 years. Completely unheard of for a human. And her arrows! There's not a demon's heart that- ahem, I apologize.]
His words were momentarily cut off by Gesti's piercing look, but soon he continued.{nl}[What I mean is that other humans have absolute faith in her arrows.]{nl}[Yes, they have every reason to. That's the problem.]
Gesti's incredibly rare compliment to a human's power astonished Solcomm. He took the chance to add, [I'm not sure if you're aware, but there is an even greater problem. All the demons she is known for defeating were victims of ingenious tricks. Schaffen is as intelligent as she is talented, and she is extremely resourceful.]{nl}[That's why I called you here. Giltine thinks you're clever enough not to fall for a trap.]
[What do you mean?]{nl}[Lately that idiot Ziburynas thought he could beat brain with brawn and went after Lydia. Ended up crossed by an arrow. Apparently she even got hold of an essence with his magic in it. That's the rumor we heard from his Pawndel minions; the other lords don't know about it yet. He wasn't even assigned to her, who knows why he went and got himself killed for nothing.]
[I'm sorry to hear that.]{nl}[If she kills you too, we'll have no one left to go to for this.]{nl}[Pardon? I- What is that you mean by...?]{nl}[It's your job now to get the Revelation from Lydia Schaffen. Your mission is in a place the humans call the Star something Lake. She is busy there building some kind of tower.]{nl}Solcomm knew this was not an order he was allowed to refuse, and so he signaled to Gesti his obedience. With that began the history of his legendary defeat.
Record of Solcomm's Attacks on the Astral Tower 1
If the tower is completed, attacking by force is useless, Solcomm thought.{nl}The cold brawl between him and Schaffenstar was beginning to warm up again. It all started when Solcomm was in the process of gathering his demon henchmen. Mobilizing a large group of demons in the human realm was no easy task, especially when it involved staying under the radar of the goddesses.
Perhaps fortunately for him, many were the demons Lydia Schaffen had encountered and killed throughout her life, including several high-ranked demon lords. This was a convenient pretext for Solcomm's side to launch a revenge war without over-worrying about their agreement with the goddesses.
Whether it was in true combat, or whether Schaffen killed those demons in self-defense did not matter. The truth remained that they needed to move a whole army of demons. To make matters worse, there was always the chance of an extended war with Lydia and her Schaffenstar organization, which would require constant supply of demon soldiers and trusted officials to command them.{nl}Assembling demon subordinates was an arduous task, even for a demon lord. Hauberk was right when he touted over and over again that demons needed better systematization of their orders. No demon should be without association, he had said.
Unfortunately, being thorough was not in their nature. Orders were given by whichever high-rank official was nearest, so subordinates simply fell under the control of whomever they preferred. The Creator had provided them and the goddesses with enough freedom. It simply happened that the idea of systematization did not conform with their principles. More importantly, when the power of every demon was needed, they had Giltine.
For better or for worse, demons of all degrees answered to Giltine, although the situation did not call for her to mobilize the entire demon forces. They still saw systematization as ineffective and cumbersome, despite some, like Hauberk, believing otherwise.{nl}It took Solcomm longer than expected to gather demons for combat and sufficient minions to serve them. When he finally arrived at Starlit Lake, he saw in all its glory the Astral Tower, now fully complete and operational.
Record of Solcomm's Attacks on the Astral Tower 2
It was the day of his first attack. He sighted a few Shaffenstar members scraping the bottom of the lake with rakes and other instruments, and he gave his subordinates orders to charge.{nl}The first demon hadn't yet reached the side of the lake when they heard the alarm sound inside the Astral Tower. Given its enormous height, it became clear that a surprise attack was all but impossible. Perhaps they would have been more successful on a foggy day, although fog was rarely an occurrence near that lake. It was said to be one of the reasons Lydia Schaffen had chosen it in the first place.
The Shaffenstar members working around the lake had heard the alarm and were preparing to abandon the location. As the lake was only ankle-deep, from far away it looked as if the people were walking on the water. Steady but collected, they hurried back inside the tower.{nl}The alarm had come too fast for the demons to attempt an attack on the returning members. Solcomm did not release any more orders to his men, but as the first demons made contact with the lake, something unexpected happened.
Some demons were instantly scorched, some melted, yet others turned to stone: it was as if the lake was toxic, provoking all kinds of gruesome reactions on their bodies.{nl}Solcomm muttered under his breath. They had no way to know what was in that water until then.{nl}The entire lake could be seen and surveilled from the Astral Tower. There was even a large telescope at the top.
Any recon operation, even in a small team, seemed impossible. Attempting one was accepting the almost sure chance of being discovered. There would be no turning back.
Solcomm dismissed his head officer and gave his subordinates orders to retrieve a sample of lake water before retreating entirely. He had chosen to remain optimistic about his efforts.
Record of Solcomm's Attacks on the Astral Tower 3
Investigating the lake water was futile. Perhaps they could have found a solution for a simpler kind of holy water, but this substance was much more complex. It had been created with not only magic, but alchemistic and theological knowledge far too advanced to decipher in such a short time.
Observing the sacrifice of the first demons to come in contact with the lake taught them that it was part holy water, modified to react to demons and nothing else. They would have attempted to destroy the main devices powering the water's reaction, but getting to them involved passing through the lake's dangerous waters. Even without the interference of Schaffenstar's members, there was no way around it.
 Solcomm certainly had his talented subordinates, but all Schaffenstar members were expert marksmen. Each demon would have been crossed by ten different arrows before they could even reach the lake's devices. Sure enough, even their most agile flying demons could not escape the tower's large ballista.
 Next, he attempted an attack by ship. Despite its shallow appearance, the Starlit Lake hid in it an abyss of unknown depth. The Astral Tower had been magically built hovering above this abyss, with the path leading to the tower also constructed through magic means. The area containing the tower and its path had been built on floating magic stones, while the rest remained a normal lake. Solcomm's plan, then, was to attack the tower from the magic-free zones surrounding it.
Unfortunately, obtaining the ships he needed wasn't as easy as planned. Even with Pbeta in charge of gathering ships and volunteers to sail them, their numbers fell short, so Solcomm resorted to secretly contacting Premier Eminent for help. Eminent had been gathering tremendous wealth in the human realm and was able to support their endeavour. Thus the demons could finally set sail on the Starlit Lake.
Sailing aboard the ships, the demons avoided contact with the water. They sailed for a few moments without signs of the enemy. The lake did not seem protected by any naval forces. Upon reaching a certain point in the lake, a downpour of arrows suddenly began to fall onto the demons' ships, piercing holes and splashing the lake's harmful water on their bodies. Unable to save the ships, the demons were helpless as water continued to infiltrate through the holes.
The attack was not unforeseen, however. Solcomm had expected the occupants of the tower to fire their arsenal at his men; it was their most obvious means for defense.
Solcomm's goal was to determine whether his enemies on the lake in Astral Tower had other means of defense besides projectile weapons.{nl}After much sacrifice and enduring countless arrows and weapons fired by the Schaffenstar members, he managed to approach the tower. Convinced that he now understood every means of defense at the tower's disposal, Solcomm retreated his army.
Even his flying monsters, which are normally capable of attacking rooftops and flying over the lake, were useless. However, Solcomm's attempt to approach the tower was not in vain.{nl}Now that he was assured that Astral Tower only protected itself with projectile weapons, he came up with a plan.
Record of Solcomm's Attacks on the Astral Tower 4
The area containing Astral Tower and the lake was later designated as under Schaffenstar's jurisdiction, but the people have been living there before that.{nl}Rather than the immediate area surrounding the tower, where battles could happen at any moment, people lived above the lake, which was fairly distant from the tower.{nl}Some parts of the village were built above magical levitation stones, which were placed by Schaffenstar, and other parts were built above boats and wooden structures.
These people were Solcomm's next target. He was certain that Schaffenstar would never let these people suffer. Based on recent battles, Solcomm figured that most ranged weapons in Astral Tower could not reach the lake village, and even if some magic attack reached the area, its effects would be greatly reduced. 
After some sieges and scouting attempts, Solcomm learned this: Astral Tower is equipped with weapons that can strike down enemy ships. In order to make such defense possible, the lake was carefully divided into areas that have magical levitation stones to allow passage, as well as areas that were empty.{nl}Due to this, attacking the tower with ships was close to suicidal. It didn't matter whether the ships were filled with demons or humans. The ships would be destroyed.
To Solcomm's surprise, no one seemed to know how deep the lake was. If any of the demons were to touch its water, they would melt and burn like acid.{nl}Solcomm previously sent his beast monsters and captured humans to scout underwater, but none returned. Finally, Solcomm decided to dive under the lake himself.
However, even after swimming downward for five hours, he had to return without seeing the lake's bottom.{nl}The further he plunged, he encountered stranger and more aggressive creatures.{nl}When the armor he was wearing was punctured, the lake's water, which was fatal to demons, came pouring in. Solcomm almost died before coming ashore, and he had to give up scouting underwater. 
It is a surprise that fishermen living above the lake paid taxes to Schaffenstar, the governing body of Astral Tower, and received protection in return.{nl}Although it wasn't designated as such by the king yet, Lydia Schaffen and her Schaffenstar were basically the rulers of the lake.{nl}The people living above and around the lake were proud of serving Lydia Schaffen, a legendary hero, and the Schaffenstar members were fair and just in their ruling. Other than some big cities, no place was safer than this lake.
Whenever there were monsters near the area, the Schaffenstar members were immediately deployed to shoot them down.{nl}However, with a large demon army such as Solcomm's, things went a bit differently.{nl}Without full-on battles outside the tower, the area's villagers couldn't be protected.{nl}Also, even if the Schaffenstar members were all elite marksmen, fighting in the open is nothing like firing arrows from an impregnable tower.
Generally speaking, archers need either distance or height to gain a combat advantage. Otherwise, they become easy targets for enemy infantry and cavalry. Solcomm knew that even the famous Schaffenstar wouldn't be able to overcome these limits.
The problem was luring them out. Solcomm's plan was to attack the lake village to force Schaffenstar to come out of their tower.{nl}Right after Solcomm began his attacks, the entrance to the village was shut tight.{nl}Although it wasn't much, it was enough to make it very inconvenient for demons to approach though the lake's fatal water.{nl}However, tearing down its wooden barriers would be a simple task with enough ships.{nl}Solcomm was certain that Schaffenstar would have to come out if that happened.
However, it never happened.{nl}In fact, there was no need.
Tornadoes suddenly appeared.{nl}It was merely a lake, but the tornados' scale was overwhelmingly huge.{nl}Solcomm couldn't help but stare at it.
Although the lake was considerable large, and tornadoes can occur on land, the occurrence itself was quite baffling.{nl}When tornadoes appear precisely above attacking ships, this doesn't happen by chance.{nl}Frankly, these tornadoes were so precise in their positioning, that they kept circling the village.{nl}Whenever these tornadoes barely touched Solcomm's ships, they were overturned, throwing helpless demons into the lake in the process.{nl}Although some ships managed to avoid these tornadoes, the lake's fatal water was sprayed all over the ships.
This didn't happen when the demons were attacking the tower itself.{nl}It could be deduced that Schaffenstar wasn't trying to hide their capability of summoning tornadoes, but rather, built villages in places where tornadoes could be summoned in the first place.{nl}Sadly, for Solcomm, this deduction was correct.{nl}Solcomm had to retreat without getting to see a single arrow, let alone Schaffenstar members.
Record of Solcomm's Attacks on the Astral Tower 5
His next plan was to hire human mercenaries.{nl}Strategically, it was much better to create an army containing both demons and human mercenaries, but even the greediest mercenaries weren't too keen on fighting alongside demons.{nl}Solcomm even had to disguise himself as a human to get them to sign the contracts in the first place.
Even then, most mercenaries, who were initially interested in offered payment, refused to attack peaceful villagers.{nl}Even the crazier ones who were willing to attack the innocent would look at Solcomm in disbelief after learning that Lydia Schaffen will be their foe.
Furthermore, one of the mercenaries reported to the royal officers of these recruiting efforts, causing government officials to start searching for suspicious people looking to hire mercenaries.{nl}This prevented any mercenaries from joining Solcomm.
To make matters worse, Pbeta, who has been supporting Solcomm by traveling between the demonic world and the human world, reported Solcomm's mistakes to Demon Queen Gesti, causing him to be summoned and scolded. After this incident was spread within the underworld, other demon lords and queens started to look down upon Solcomm, causing his position in the underworld to fall even further.
Although Solcomm gave a warning to Pbeta for her reports, doing so was her job, so he couldn't just blame everything on her.{nl}At least, it was a relief to him that Lydia Schaffen and her Schaffenstar haven't warned others of the attack, let alone ask for reinforcements. However, this was likely due to Schaffenstar's pride and their level of preparation for the attack.
Solcomm did not know this at the time, but Lydia Schaffen didn't ask for help because the tower must be prepared to withstand attacks without any support from the royal army or militia for centuries to come.{nl}She was very much aware that someone like King Kadumel could rise to power at any moment to unite the demons with humans. Kings like Kadumel will undoubtedly try to seize the secrets contained in Astral tower, and the tower must be able to stand tall when that happens.{nl}Sadly, Solcomm was destined to slowly learn this over the next couple of centuries.
Record of Solcomm's Attacks on the Astral Tower 6
If we were to use force, we should have done it before the tower was complete, was Solcomm's conclusion. Even so, Solcomm had no other choice but to resort to an all-out attack. He couldn't just ignore the criticisms from his superiors, so he had to push on. Also, he had to try at least once.
While being very much aware that Schaffenstar will not lower their defenses, Solcomm kept his force from making hasty attacks, and gathered even more demons by pushing Pbeta.{nl}After Solcomm's failures were spread in the demonic world, Pbeta's job of recruiting demons became much more difficult, and she made sure to let Solcomm know of her difficulties.{nl}However, Solcomm was ready to push himself to  the end for the last time.
For more than six months, Solcomm prepared for his all-out attack. He didn't have enough flying demons, nor enough ships, but he had to make do by approaching the tower through the lake. 
The magical levitation stones were floating in a way that shallow water still flowed over them. It was too shallow for boats, and still too deep for demons to cross.{nl}Lydia Schaffen made sure these stones were floating at the exact heights to make this possible. This also made Schaffenstar members' shoes wet all the time, but for demons, it was a deadly threat.
When there weren't any battles or training during the day, Schaffenstar's recruits removed moss and water plants from the stones with rakes.{nl}After that, they carefully walked to the edge and tossed the plants in the lake.{nl}These tossed plants eventually became food for creatures living in the lake, leading countless creatures to be gathered around the floating stones.
Schaffenstar recruits were strictly trained and taught where the edges were, and where it was safe to walk, because there was no end to the lake's depth.{nl}Their daily routine of removing plants was also helpful in drilling this information into their minds. Of course, seniors were always nearby to make sure absolutely no recruits accidently fell in the lake.
Such accidents were much more fatal than one would think.{nl}As mentioned before, creatures were always gathered around the edges of these stones.{nl}These creatures may seem harmless from above, but if someone were to fall over the edge, they would attack that person without any hesitation. A fall into the lake was almost impossible to survive.{nl}This was one of the biggest reasons that made attacking the tower from the lake very difficult.{nl}If the boats were to sink, the demons didn't have anywhere to swim to.{nl}Although they were strong enough to swim to the edges of these stones, those were the most dangerous places.
The parts of the lake that didn't have any magical levitation stones over them were much safer.{nl}Of course, this would only be true until the demons become exhausted from swimming and sunk below.{nl}However, the villagers under protection of Schaffenstar were mostly safe in these areas. You see, the plants that were fed to them weren't intended to be food, but rather, highly addictive substances.{nl}This was one of Lydia's defensive strategies.
Because of their addiction, most of the aggressive and carnivorous creatures stayed around these edges, and other fish could safely breed and grow their numbers. This hugely benefited the fishermen of the village.{nl}Although carnivorous creatures would sometimes return to the lake's center to find their prey, they would immediately return to the edges for more plants afterward.{nl}The fishermen ran into these creatures occasionally, but they always carried some dried water plants to toss in the water.
However, tossing these plants in the wrong places could lead to fatal accidents, so the Schaffenstar members warned the fishermen to do this only when necessary.{nl}In the end, since most of these plants were tossed near the edges, the most dangerous creatures just stayed there rather than chasing the fishermen.
All of these factors guaranteed that the walkable surfaces were kept clean.{nl}These clean surfaces were soon tainted by Solcomm and his minions during their march toward the Astral Tower.
They brought vast amounts of soil to pour over the stones, which made it safe for the demons to march.{nl}It is a textbook tactic to fill moats that surround castles, but in this case, the whole lake functioned as one giant moat. A siege that involved filling a whole lake like this was unprecedented.{nl}Thankfully for the demons, the water was shallow enough where they were, but they still had a long way to go.{nl}Also, they had to cover a wide surface to avoid incoming arrows from the tower.
Despite their fierce march, a whole day has passed without a single battle.{nl}This was peculiar, but expected at the same time. The demons were busy filling the lake to make paths, and they kept out of Astral Tower's catapult's reach.{nl}Even Lydia Schaffen was limited by her weapons' range.
Because the area above the magical levitation stones were actually safe from the Astral Tower's defensive weapons,{nl}all Schaffenstar had to do was place guards on the tower and observe their slow progress. The typical process of pouring arrows upon attackers' siege attempts wasn't going to happen for a while.
On the second day, it finally happened.{nl}Solcomm's army finally reached the tower's attack range.{nl}Right after this, Schaffenstar members fired all sorts of projectiles above demons' heads, which reached much further than what humans' weapons are normally capable of. While the projectiles were flying over them, the demons had no choice but to keep filling the lake.
Siege towers with roofs were brought to minimize the damage, but even such structures would fall to the continuous stream of projectiles.{nl}One positive outcome from all this was that the thrown rocks could be utilized to fill more parts of the lake.{nl}Because the Astral Tower was built on top of a lake, most traditional siege weapons were rendered useless.{nl}For example, digging tools for sieges couldn't be used, even if demons were capable of digging underwater.
Solcomm was indeed aware of the fact that Lydia Schaffen would be fully prepared for him.{nl}If his enemy was the lake, he was even prepared to bring an army the size of an ocean to swallow that lake. He was under that much pressure from by his superiors.
Unfortunately, for Solcomm, his army was progressing at an excruciatingly slow speed, and its number was becoming smaller by the minute.{nl}Most demons and monsters love to fight, and are used to desperate situations.{nl}However, this was something else. All they did was staring at their feet while being attacked. Unsurprisingly, complaints began pouring out.{nl}Dying in a proper battle was much more preferable, and they are much more controllable during battles.
However, Solcomm's minions quickly grew tired doing nothing against the arrows and stones that were flying toward them.{nl}Even Pbeta's discontent toward Solcomm was growing.
Despite all this, his army finally reached the tower's entrance.{nl}Flying demons, who were occupied in shooting down the projectiles, could finally focus on attacking the tower.{nl}Although some demons had to keep filling the lake, the rest could march straight over the small amount of water. Finally, after several days have passed, they would have their proper battle.
 Of course, streams of boiling water, stones, arrows, fire, and magic started pouring over the demons' heads when they got close enough. Most of the flying demons were hit by arrows soon after the battle began, and they fell on parts of the lake that weren't filled.{nl}Although it seemed like Solcomm was fighting a losing battle, it was still a battle.
Solcomm was ready to fight to his death, no matter the outcome. All of his demons were already on the lake, and Solcomm himself charged in front of his minions.{nl}Despite popular belief, there is no such thing as an impregnable castle.{nl}Even if all the siege attempts had failed, the defenders are bound to run out of resources without help from allies to attack the surrounding army. Sturdy weaponry and catapults are only there to buy enough time for that to happen. Whether you were on the attacking side, or the defending side, the side who is able to hold out wins.
Knowing this, Solcomm kept encouraging his demons.{nl}But then, when he looked over his head, he saw Lydia Schaffen herself, aiming an arrow at his head.{nl}It almost looked as if she was waiting for Solcomm to see her aiming at him.
At that moment, Solcomm immediately recognized the weapon she was holding. It was the bow that killed the Demon Lord Ziburynas.{nl}A single arrow would be enough to kill Solcomm.{nl}Solcomm was well aware that she would be able to hit him with her arrow if he charged in front.{nl}Despite this, he had to do this to silence the resentment from his minions and superiors.
He could withstand the scolding from Gesti, but if she sent him back to Kartas, there would be no telling what he would do to Solcomm as punishment.{nl}Being tortured by Kartas was much worse than being killed by Lydia's arrows.
However, her arrow never came. Instead, she withdrew her arrow and said this: [Fools! You are standing over stones that are controlled with magic.]{nl}Her words could be clearly heard by Solcomm who was still quite far away.{nl}However, he did not understand the meaning behind her words. He was about to find out.
At that moment, the stones that Solcomm's army was standing on started trembling, and soon after, they started to sink below the lake.{nl}Even demons who generally remain calm in times of chaos started screaming.{nl}Water started pouring over the stones and burned every demon that was on them.{nl}Solcomm couldn't do anything but watch his minions burn and melt in water.{nl}It was then Solcomm finally realized that Lydia was waiting for his entire army to move on to the lake.{nl}The distance his army had to run would take days.{nl}Even his flying minions had to avoid rains of arrows to retreat.
When only a handful of demons made it out, Pbeta arrived with additional demons from the demonic world.{nl}Because Solcomm was too shocked to do anything, Pbeta calmed the survivors in his stead.
Based on the report made by Pbeta after this incident, these magical levitation stones cannot be raised or lowered easily.{nl}According to experts on magic, if the stones were moved like this once, it would take decades before being able to do so again.
However, at the very moment, Solcomm and Pbeta didn't have the time to think it through. All the construction done over the stones were destroyed,{nl}and Schaffenstar members took back what could be used as defensive weapons, and threw out the rest.
Some demons were sent to interrupt their operations, but it was too difficult to fight on the lake in the first place. Also, the guards on the tower quickly warned the cleaning crew whenever any demons got close. Half of Schaffenstar shot arrows to keep them at bay, and the other half would run to retreat, taking turns.{nl}The situation was against Solcomm from the beginning, but it didn't stop him from being shunned by demon society.{nl}Although the lower demons wouldn't dare insult him at his face, Solcomm was aware of their discontent.{nl}He couldn't, however, figure out how to regain their trust.
Record of Solcomm's Attacks on the Astral Tower 7
In the end, the demons failed in surrounding the tower and making humans inside to starve to death.{nl}Lydia Schaffen didn't even have to ask for help. After people found out that she was being attacked by the demons, countless men and women took up arms and went to the lake. Even the Royal Army was deployed due to public demand.
Since Solcomm didn't want to fight to the death, he retreated his demons and minions, and went into hiding.{nl}After this incident, it became clear that large-scale sieges like this won't be viable unless the humans' unity was broken and their kingdom fell into chaos.{nl}This surely wasn't going to happen anytime soon, and Solcomm wasn't in a hurry.{nl}Although Pbeta kept trying, assembling demons for attacks was becoming more difficult with each passing day.
Then, Solcomm decided to use humans' one weakness: their mortality.{nl}He decided to simply wait for Lydia Schaffen to grow old and die.{nl}Solcomm was looked down upon by his minions due to this so-called plan, but he was running out of options.{nl}However, he also worked behind the scenes to prevent anyone from becoming Lydia Schaffen's successor or joining Shaffenstar.
Sadly, his schemes and tricks were all in vain.{nl}Schaffen's legacies and stories were heard all around the kingdom.{nl}The story of her being in disguise and punishing a tyrannical lord by hitting an apple on the head of a farmer's son,{nl}her forest adventures with Jon Himil (who was curiously considered small, despite his huge size) and their group of righteous outlaws during their days as members of Shaffenstar, the tale of her outsmarting Rumpelstiltskin in a bet, and the legend of her killing the demon king Ziburynas spread far and wide. After hearing of her exploits, countless people came to Shaffenstar to join them.
However, with enough patience, the chance to infiltrate the tower could come. Even if it would take centuries.{nl}Solcomm had the necessary patience, and was aware of humans' nature of forgetting their initial stance over time.{nl}What he didn't know, was that his minions weren't as patient as him.

Then I heard there was a Tetriox roaming around Fedimian, so I came thinking I could get rid of it and teach the soldiers some of my techniques, maybe look for an assistant here.
I need some tools to teach the soldiers with so I ordered some things from a few merchants, but the orders are taking a while.
Finally, Rima in Klaipeda is making the cape we need to lure the beast.
Not only that, for the kind that she wants I need actual Blue Hohen Gulak horns from Kadumel Cliff.
In pristine condition, too.
It's almost impossible to find a whole Blue Hohen Gulak horn these days.{nl}I don't know I'm supposed to finish this.
So you're here to check on the weapons I'm making for the Matador Master.{nl}Well... to make the weapons I need an ore that only exists in Nevellet Quarry.{nl}But going there is way more dangerous than I would like.
Bring me 10 pieces of Cockatrice Leather in good condition. The monsters are usually around the Fedimian Suburbs.
From Veja Ravine, get me 12 sturdy Beetow Feelers.
I also need 15 pieces of strong Minivern Skin, which you can get from the Miniverns in the Mage Tower 4F.
Just be careful. You're dealing with monsters, after all.
I was just starting to get settled when the Master came and asked me to sew the capes for her.{nl}At first I didn't want to take the order, because I have no way of getting the silk cocoon I need to make the capes.
To get the cocoon I would need to go all the way to the Emmet Forest, but these days it's just too dangerous to go outside.
So I was wondering what to do about this monster.{nl}I noticed a few other monsters with this golden dust falling off of them: some Red Spions and Firents in Salvia Forest and Nefritas Cliff.
{nl}My suspicious colleague gave all my bullet recipes to Manager Rota, so she's the one who has them now.
You'll have to get the recipes from Manager Rota and make them yourself.
You'll need a material called Demon Magic Dust for all the bullets.{nl}There are 5 magic aggregators installed at the Shaton Reservoir giving out a reddish light.
Get rid of some monsters around it and get their flesh.
When the magic aggregator's light is on, add in the flesh and it will come out as Demon Magic Dust.
For the Frost bullets you'll need Pure Frost Fragments, which you can get from Ice property monsters.{nl}They usually live in Vedas Plateau, so head there.
For the Lightning Bullets you need Electric Stones.{nl}They're impossible to spot with the naked eye, though.
I made you a lantern you can use to find the Electric Stones.{nl}Turn on the lantern and walk around until you see the Electric Stones shine.
Once you made all the bullets, shoot the Frost Bullets at the Red Spions in Salvia Forest and the Fire Bullets at the Firents in Nefritas Cliff.
As for the Lightning Bullets, they're for the Blue Lepusbunny monsters in Sekta Forest.
They have a strange glow going on under their feet, so you'll know when you see them.
I'm writing it all down in case you forget.{nl}Just make sure to get the bullet recipes from Manager Rota.
Remember the lantern I gave you?{nl}Turn it on and the Electric Stones will shine when you're near.
This device can no longer produce Demon Magic Dust.
That's enough Cockatrice Leather.
Oh, I almost forgot. You aren't familiar with shadows yet; it can be difficult for you to see them.{nl}If you look at my research devices, you'll see a blue light shine around them. That's when you should use them.{nl}
The energy of the devices makes shadows appear more clearly around you.{nl}You can turn off that effect at the device if you want it to return to normal.{nl}
If you do turn it off, however, you'll have to wait until the devices glow again to reactivate the effect.{nl}If you have any questions about the characteristics of the shadows in each region, do ask. I will do my best to answer.
The device of Lhadar Forest is at the hill between Tjibes Refuge and Bethez Refuge.{nl}The shadows there appear much more clearly than those in other regions according to their influence.{nl}
If you see a shadow, try and approach only shadows of the same influence.{nl}Increase that influence in the shadows to obtain their traces.{nl}
You need to be careful, however. If you catch a shadow carrying another kind of influence, you own influence will decrease.{nl}Keep that in mind.
If you leave, you will have to wait until a shadow's influence manifests itself in the device again.{nl}Are you sure you want to leave?
Information
The shadows of Khonot Forest will run away if you approach them, so you need to become a shadow yourself.{nl}Press the Space key on the transformation device to turn into a shadow.{nl}
After some time you will return to your original appearance.{nl}Once transformed into a shadow, quickly approach other shadows and press the Space key to catch them and increase your influence.
Choose one of the three influences of Lhadar Forest shadows and attack.{nl}After you attack and increase your own influence, make sure to only go after shadows of that same influence.{nl}
Keep in mind that attacking shadows of a different influence will reduce your own.
Approach the shadows of Ziburynas Forest and press the Space key to scare them, increasing your influence.{nl}
Some shadows may be hidden and waiting to scare you.{nl}If you fall victim to their pranks, your own influence decreases.
Catch the shadows at the Namu Temple Ruins to increase your influence.{nl}
Some shadows might try and chase you instead.{nl}Your influence decreases if you are caught by them, so be careful.

I need some Cockatrice Leather, Beetow Feelers and Minivern Skin in good condition.{nl}The problem is, since these are monster materials, they're not sold on the market.
LOST: Missing important amulets belonging to the Nak Muay Master.{nl}If found, please return to General Lamin for reward.
The guard ought to know about the missing amulet.
You do seem like an experienced adventurer, but it's a very dangerous situation, you see.
Alright, I can see you're determined to help.{nl}I worry if this isn't too much of a burden for you, but I can at least tell you where the amulet is.{nl}The amulet is with someone named Eimantas.
He had a problem he wanted to solve, so he went to visit the Exorcist Master.
No has heard from him after Poslinkis Forest, however.{nl}There's a chance he might still be there.
The amulet is a kind of necklace, and it is very dear to the Nak Muay Master.{nl}One time, the Master had to borrow money at the arena to support his family, and he gave the amulet as security.
Unfortunately, the manager that lent him the money ended up selling away the amulet.
Since the amulet is a necklace, an accessory merchant might know something more about it.
An amulet? Do you mean the necklace with the three men engraved in it?{nl}Yes, there are a lot of rumors about that necklace.
They say that a ghost will haunt you if you wear it, and that it curses you with horrible nightmares.{nl}I'm not sure, either.
But if you need more information, I'm sure the Wings of Vaivora can help you.
The amulet with the ghost?{nl}Yes, that necklace looks very different from the usual. It naturally attracts people's curiosity.
Although it seems that the ghost that lives in the amulet is closely related to its original owner.{nl}So when the amulet falls in the hands of another person, the ghost will appear in their dreams and demand that they return the amulet.
We don't know who the original owner is, however.{nl}All we know is that, the longer the amulet is away...{nl}... the more it becomes corrupted by the ghost's fears and sorrows. It even attracted an evil spirit.
And now there is no way to reach the amulet's ghost without first giving the evil spirit what it wants.{nl}To make matters worse, the current owner of the amulet suffers from nightmares so horrible it's become nearly impossible to talk to them.
The way I see it, only an Exorcist or someone equally blessed with the grace of the goddesses could solve this.
We remember our friend, who so fond was of strawberry cupcakes. We hope you are eating them with the goddesses now...
To my beloved wife Isala, who passed without ever seeing our daughter Asana grow. May you find happiness by the goddesses...
Our dear friend; your disease can no longer hurt you where you are. May you find eternal peace by the goddesses...
My friend. How you longed to return to the Inner Enceinte District, your home destroyed by the curse.{nl}May your new home by the goddesses offer you the comfort you yearned for.
To my friend, who died before he could profess his love... (The stone is destroyed, making it impossible to read the rest.)
There's an altar to make offerings.
You want to know if I can make a strawberry cupcake for a spirit? Of course I can.
I'm going to need strawberries and flour and all those things, but if it's for a spirit I also need Red Meduja Essence.{nl}{nl}I already have everything except for the strawberries and Meduja essence.{nl}
If you bring me about 100 Strawberries and 130 Red Meduja Essences I can make you the best strawberry cupcake for your offering.
Oh, you have all the ingredients.{nl}Alright, just wait now.
I'll make the biscuits in no time.
All done.{nl}It's so sad to hear how much this poor person wanted these cupcakes, but there you go.
You want a treatment for a spirit that's suffering from a disease?{nl}
Well, it's not impossible.{nl}If I have all the ingredients, that is.{nl}I'll need about 1 Holy Water, 1 Antidote and 100 Bright Ellom Bells.
You have all the materials, good.{nl}I'll get it done right away, just wait a while.
Here you go.
A house for homesick spirits, you say?{nl}Hm... I can't make them a house, but there is a way to comfort them.
I could carve a little wooden house, and if you bring me a rock or something from their hometown, I can add that to the sculpture.{nl}I'll get started on the house; you can go and find that.
Oh, a dandelion from the spirit's hometown.{nl}Alright, just wait a while.
I'll get right to it.
There you go.{nl}I hope it can bring some comfort to the spirits who lost their homes.
Oh, yes, the girl who looks after her sick father.{nl}She used to live in Fedimian, but they've moved to Tenants' Farm now.{nl}It seems she thought the country life would be better for her father's health.
Hm... I'm not sure who you mean.
Yeah, I know Asana.{nl}She was well-known in Fedimian. Beautiful inside and out.
I heard she moved to Tenants' Farm with her dad. Wonder what she's been up to now.
The name sounds familiar, but I can't really remember.
Yes, the girl who moved to Tenants' Farm with her ailing father.{nl}I'm afraid there isn't much I can tell you about her.
Asana?{nl}I can't be sure.{nl}You might want to ask someone else.
Asana. Wasn't that the girl who lived with her dad in Fedimian?{nl}I heard she took the father to Tenants' Farm because of his health, but I don't know what happened to them after that.
Asana...{nl}Huh, I can't remember.
Sorry I can't help.
You mean you don't know the girl who works to support her poor father?{nl}They went away to Tenants' Farm, but I don't know how they're doing over there.
Sorry, I'm getting old. My memory isn't what it used to be.
Asana...{nl}Haven't heard that name in a long time.
She always worked so hard to support her father. Kind girl, she was.{nl}She moved to Tenants' Farm with him. Thought the countryside would be better for his health.
I wonder if they're doing alright in Tenants' Farm.
Asana?{nl}I'm not sure.
Asana? The girl who went to Tenants' Farm with her sick father?{nl}I don't know that much about her.
I'm not sure who that is.{nl}You ought to ask someone else.
The girl who lives in Fedimian with her father, yes?{nl}I don't know much about her.{nl}I do remember hearing that they moved to Tenants' Farm, however.
I don't know. Sorry, I don't really see many people around here.
Asana?{nl}Yes, she recently moved to Tenants' Farm with her father because of his health.{nl}I heard there was trouble at the farm; hopefully they are okay.
Yes, the girl who works to support her father.{nl}I wonder how she's doing.
Asana no longer lives here. They went to Tenants' Farm, for her father's health.
I'm sorry, I don't know about Asana.{nl}It would be best to ask someone else.
Yes, I know Asana.{nl}She went to Tenants' Farm to look after her father's health.
Asana is no longer living in Fedimian.{nl}Though I can't remember where she moved to.
I think you should ask someone else.
Ah, yes! The kind girl.{nl}Her father raised her all by himself, now the girl lives to support him.{nl}He's the reason they went away to Tenants' Farm.
Yes, the kind girl who's supporting her father.{nl}They both went away because of his health, though I can't remember where it is they went.
Asana?{nl}She left Femidian not long ago with her father. They went to Tenants' Farm.
Yes, I know Asana.{nl}She left Fedimian not long ago, but I'm not sure where she went.
Oh, that friendly girl, yes.{nl}Her and I never talked much, but I do remember her saying she was going to Tenants' Farm with her father.
Her and I never really talked much, so I'm not sure.
There's a person lying on the ground. They're groaning in pain.
Eimantas
Ugh...{nl}Stop...{nl}Let me go...
The air feels strange. Suddenly, everything goes dark.
After waking up, an eery feeling remains.{nl}It's best to ask Eimantas about it.
I started having nightmares after I bought this necklace with three martial artists engraved in it.{nl}I couldn't take them anymore, so I went to see an exorcist.
The exorcist told me my case was too particular, that it was dangerous to try anything.{nl}I just know that the only way for me to break free from this agony is to do what the spirits of the amulet want.
Unfortunately, even if I want to listen to the spirits, I don't know what to do. And then there's the problem with the evil spirits in the amulet.{nl}I tried all I could to get rid of this torment but nothing works. My nightmares are only getting longer.
Warm Light
The warm light feels comforting.{nl}It's as if it can free anyone from all their worries and fears.
The warm light envelops everything.
The nightmare feels like it's slowly coming to an end.
Asana
My father told me about my mother. She still wanders the world in sorrow, unable to part with our world.
I want to go see her at Poslinkis Forest.{nl}My father isn't well enough to travel, so I am going alone.
I'm going to borrow some of her belongings and take them with me to prove that I am her daughter.{nl}I know going alone will be dangerous, but I'll be alright.
I'll leave for Poslinkis Forest when I am ready.
Arijus
My little Asana?{nl}She's away now, working. It will be a while before she returns.{nl}What is it that you need from her?
This person seems to be suffering from nightmares.
Where do I have to go to see my mother?
I hope she found peace by the goddesses now.{nl}Thank you for bringing me to her.
I see you have some vouchers.{nl}What kind of Companion do you want?
There's no need to plant dandelions here.
Iona, I look back at the years of our youth spent in Dina Bee Farm.{nl}During our 10 years together, we became even closer than family.
We struggled like everyone after Medzio Diena, but we survived.{nl}If it wasn't for you, I probably wouldn't even be here anymore.{nl}Living through such hardships with you, as time passed I saw as more than a friend. I saw you as a strong and sorrowful woman.
I wanted to be the one to stand by your side and hold your hand whenever you felt sad or afraid.
{nl}So now here I am, remorseful and ashamed, trying to express my feelings to you.{nl}I want to live my life together with you.{nl}Will you accept me?{nl}{nl}From Laimutis.
The box is decorated and contains a handwritten letter.
She slowly reads the letter.
The inside of the box is carefully decorated.
Laimutis is an old friend of mine. We lived side by side for more than 10 years.{nl}He helped me out a lot after Medzio Diena. I wouldn't be living like this if it wasn't for him.
Is this from Laimutis?{nl}Let me have a look.
Laimutis, he...{nl}He was holding on to those feelings all this time...
I did suspect it, but it's sad to have his feelings confirmed like this.{nl}You said his spirit is still roaming this world, right?{nl}I think I need to let him know.
Please bring me Stonecrops, which symbolize the love of a woman; and some Statice to represent eternal love.{nl}I would like about 60 Stonecrops and 84 Statice.
The last anyone heard from the current owner was in Poslinkis Forest.{nl}You should try there.
I feel like I can't escape this nightmare anymore, I'm trapped here forever.{nl}Please, help me.
It didn't use to feel like this. Before, if I just walked towards the light, I could still free myself from the nightmare.{nl}But now... I don't see that light anymore.
A spirit in Poslinkis Forest wants to see my little Asana?{nl}It looks like Isala is still not resting in peace.
It's going to take a while for Asana to return. You can come back later, there's no need for you to wait here.{nl}I'll speak to her and let her know.
I want to answer Laimutis' letter with Stonecrops, which symbolize the love of a woman; and some Statice to represent eternal love.
{nl}I will need about 60 Stonecrops and 84 Statice.
You brought the flowers.{nl}Just a moment.
Here.{nl}I hope my message reaches him through these flowers.
I hope he can finally rest in peace by the goddesses.
The eery sensation fades away as everything becomes more comfortable.
Unidentified Spirit
Stranger. Hello.{nl}We are Khanom's mentors.{nl}We were always by his side, protecting his fortune and wisdom.
Until one day we became separated from him.{nl}We needed to return to Khanom. We entered the dreams of those who held the amulet and begged them to return it.
But they all feared us. Some threw away the amulet, others ended up selling it.{nl}Our voices could not reach them.
After being passed from owner to owner, over time another presence began to take over the amulet.{nl}It was the ghosts you saw.
The presence of the ghosts drowned out our voices even more. They are what caused the young man Eimantas to fall into his deep nightmare.{nl}Thanks to you their wishes were finally heard, and so were ours.{nl}The spirits you freed can now be guided by the Kupoles to a peaceful rest. There's no need to worry about them anymore.
Please take the amulet from Eimantas.{nl}Make sure it reaches our student Khanom again.
The amulet will shine as you get closer to Khanom.
Please, take us to our Khanom.
I just want to return to Khanom and rest.
I see.{nl}The amulet needs to go back to its owner.
Here. Take it to him.
I'm free from the nightmare.{nl}If it wasn't for you, I would still be trapped inside.
The amulet is showing a very strong reaction.{nl}This must be the right area.
The amulet is showing a strong reaction.{nl}It must be getting closer.
The amulet is reacting.
The amulet is slowly beginning to react.
The amulet shows no reaction.{nl}It must be too far away.
Nak Muay Master
I feel the energy of my old mentors in you.
You found my amulet?{nl}Where is it?
The amulet is very precious to me.
Thank you for bringing it back to me.{nl}Not all Nak Muay can communicate with the spirits in the amulet. You must be very talented.
I lied down to rest for a moment, then suddenly I felt cold.{nl}I saw a tomb in front of my eyes...{nl}Traveler, what is happening?
These tombs all belong to resting spirits, is that right?{nl}Where is my mother?
Fedimian has more than just pottery. You can also find many interesting relics around the city.
You can come back later, traveler. I will tell Asana about Isala.
I told Asana about the spirit.{nl}She was always very curious about her mother. It broke her heart knowing she hasn't yet left our world.
She insists on going to see the spirit herself.
Apparently the amulet is very dear to the Nak Muay Master.{nl}We've never actually seen him though, we only know about the amulet because of the notice board.
An accessory merchant might be more familiar with it, I guess.
That's enough Stonecrops.
That's enough Statice.
There are no more spirits coming from this tomb.
Placed the strawberry cupcake on the altar.
Called Asana to the altar.
Placed the medicine on the altar.
Placed the house sculpture on the altar.
Placed Iona's box on the altar.
That's enough Red Meduja Essence.
That's enough Ellom Bells.
You may ask Neringa five questions.{nl}You will only ask that which is certain.{nl}
Neringa must answer you as is the will of Goddess Laima.
Goddess Vaivora and Demon Goddess Giltine became enemies after an incident in the past.{nl}It was a tragic incident which brought Giltine's evil intentions to light.{nl}
Goddess Vaivora thus swore to banish Giltine to an outer dimension.{nl}Vaivora accuses Giltine of all evil.{nl}
She believes all will be solved if Giltine is isolated from our world.{nl}
Alas, Goddess Laima foresees something very different.{nl}It is Goddess Vaivora's plan to use a Revelation to lure Giltine away from our world.{nl}
Together, we must keep Vaivora's plan from succeeding.{nl}You must allow Demon Goddess Giltine to acquire the Revelation.
Neringa has come here by order of her master, Goddess Laima.{nl}
Laima is certain you can accomplish Her mission.{nl}Therefore, it is Neringa's duty to assist you in realizing the Goddess' prophecy.
The Demon Goddess' Beholder has warned her that the Revelation is hidden inside the Fantasy Library.{nl}But Giltine knows that, should she attempt to enter the Library, she'll fall into Vaivora's trap.{nl}
She assumed Vaivora's great plan since the incident of which you do not know.{nl}She may even be certain of it now.{nl}
Giltine will mock Goddess Vaivora and send her servant into the trap.{nl}However, Vaivora will have prepared for Giltine's trick, and Giltine will fall into the trap herself.{nl}
When she does, you must help Giltine free herself from Vaivora's trap.
I was fool to think Vaivora was giving up...{nl}Laima's little servant, are you?{nl}
You thought you could defy me like your master.{nl}Where is she now to pray for your miserable lives?{nl}
Go ahead, stop me.{nl}I would love to see you try.
So you're siding with Vaivora now... I must say, you do try.{nl}Tell me, who brought you here?
I'm warning you. You stand in my way with your goddess tricks and I swear... I'm sending you to the goddess for good.
That will not happen. Rest assured.{nl}This person is here to accompany me on my duty.
Neringa! What are you doing here? Weren't you...{nl}Oh, I see. You're here to brag about how this was all a brilliant trap you created.
Neringa is different from you. Beholder, you have already played your part.{nl}Soon you will go.
Stuck up as always... I don't know what you and your goddess saw, but you can't stop Giltine now.{nl}For a foreseeing goddess, she's terrible at predicting how useless you are. Hahahahah!
What must happen will happen. Beholder, you have already played your part.{nl}You may go now.
You and your goddess are going to be really disappointed... Just wait and see.{nl}And you, human. Don't even think about sticking your nose in our business. This isn't your world, understand?
At last... Today, I dispel the shadows cast upon us.{nl}This shall be the last our world will ever see of Giltine.{nl}
She is coming. Begin.
What... What happened?{nl}
Did Giltine escape my trap?!{nl}Where is she now?{nl}
Giltine can't have escaped.{nl}I must find her!{nl}
I must ask for your help once again.{nl}I must find Giltine.{nl}
Please, I cannot allow her to steal those records.
The Kupoles and I prepared the most secure seal to entrap Giltine.{nl}However she saw through my plans and sent a servant in her place.{nl}
But I cannot let her escape.{nl}Giltine is after the Revelation Laima has hidden in Valandis Room 91.{nl}
When she enters the room, we will activate the seal.{nl}The seal will forever imprison Giltine and the Revelation inside the room.
Do you understand?{nl}
With Giltine gone from our world, there will be no need for you to collect the Revelations.{nl}Humans will be free from the threat of demons, and I and the other goddesses shall return to our due places.
Many assorted records are kept inside Valandis Room 91.{nl}
I haven't had the chance to see what they contain...{nl}But I don't believe Giltine will find any clues to escape the seal in them.{nl}
I must say, your courage is inspiring...{nl}I'm sure you're here for the Revelation.{nl}
I wonder what your poor goddess must be thinking.{nl}Laima, goddess of destiny.{nl}
All your petty hopes... It's all in my hands now.{nl}I cannot wait to show Laima the Revelation myself.{nl}
Along with her miserable minions!
And you, human. I'm afraid this is the end of your journey.{nl}
The Revelator who couldn't save the Revelation. How unfortunate!{nl}Should I even bother with you?
This is a catastrophe.{nl}I was far too lenient.{nl}
I'm certain now that Giltine's goal is to steal Laima's Revelation in Valandis Room 91.{nl}She must be stopped.{nl}
I will use the Revelation to lock Giltine in Valandis Room 91.
You already received today's Four Leaf Clover.
Geraldas, that's me.{nl}Traveled the world collecting all sorts of junk... I mean, treasures!{nl}Oh yes, priceless treasures.
Ever heard of Old Golden Coins?{nl}I'm collecting those, ya know.
I can give you Silver and a treasure from my collection.{nl}If you get me some Old Golden Coins I'll even give you a little something for free.
Whaddaya say? Deal?
Yes, please. I'll buy.
Eh, I'm looking to trade with someone a little more experienced.{nl}Nothing personal.
LOST{nl}Valuable amulet belonging to the Nak Muay Master.{nl}Reward provided if found. For inquiries, contact General Lamin.
I could carve a little wooden house, and if you bring me a rock, a flower or something from their hometown, I can add that to the sculpture.{nl}I'll get started on the house; you can go and find that.
Is there anything I can help you with?
You look like you have something to ask. Go ahead.
Unfortunately for Gesti, not all would go according to her plans.{nl}"How dare you use humans... How dare you even consider associating with those humans!"
Gesti was certain Laima remained unaware of her plot. The goddess, on the other hand, had long predicted her actions, and was now more infuriated than ever with the demon's sheer audacity to follow through with them. Laima felt deceived. She felt as if Gesti was infringing the most basic of rules, even if no such rules existed for the demon. That fact only added to Laima's bitter indignation.
The young man replied.{nl}[What do you mean? I'm going to bring true prosperity to your family, I'm going to make your name known. If anything, you should be thanking me for even having chosen you.]{nl}
[Please, stop trying. What is it that you want to reveal about my true identity? Other than me not being human, you know nothing.]{nl}[What are you?]{nl}[You will die soon, so I will not hide it. I am what you call a demon. A demon lord. I shall not reveal my true name. It is enough for you to know the name of Eminent, your family. When you die, there will be no more Eminents and no more unrest, no more disorder.]{nl}[Why are you after the lands and authority of a human?]{nl}[I have my reasons, but there is no need or time to elaborate.]{nl}Uttering these words, the young man reached out with his hand and lightly touched the other. He was still breathing slowly, his eyes closed. Later, with the servants back in the room tending to him, he would have his last breath. But not now.
Cunningham had his answer ready.
Grief washed over Laima at the mention of Ruklys' name and she finally agreed with Cunningham. She blessed his noble sacrifice and left the mine. In Her remained the deep sorrow of the memories She had sought to forget.{nl}
Nebulas, refusing to let Ausura have the final word, threw at her one last question.{nl}[Your boss won't say anything if I have it my way in Kalejimas, will she?]{nl}Ausura's response was harsh.{nl}[Gesti has no interest in whatever havoc you wreak there, so long as you retrieve the Revelation.]{nl}
You can trade your event items for event shop currency here.{nl}How many would you like?

Retiarius Master
If you're looking to become a Retiarius, you need to learn how to use the rete, your main weapon.{nl}Would you like to try some exercises? All you have to do is trap monsters with the rete, as many as I tell you.{nl}I'll give you extra points if you can get monsters of the same type!

I told Asana about the spirit.{nl}She was always very curious about her mother. It broke her heart knowing she hasn't yet left our world.
She insists on going to see the spirit herself.
Like the Murmillos, the Retiarii are a gladiator class specialized in the arena.
Before you can become a Retiarius, you must pass a test of strength and resilience.
Would you like to take the test?{nl}I won't stop you if you're willing.
Very well, let's begin.
I see.{nl}There's been some friction between the landowners and the farmers at Tenants' Farm, it's best not to get ourselves involved in it.
I get it.{nl}I won't insist.
It's better to give up while you can, rather than force yourself into something you might regret.
Strong determination is absolutely necessary.{nl}You don't want to become one of the many who fall behind during basic training.
What kind of training would you like to try?
Lift this dumbbell and train your muscles.
Take this sandbag, then run to the locations marked on the map and come back.
For the agility training, you need to use the Management Orb.{nl}Just interact with the Orb to find out what you need to do.
For the endurance training, you will need to practice sustaining attacks from monsters.
The audience loves impressive endings, it's what drives them to support their favorite fighters.{nl}That's why gladiators practice with a focus on a dramatic combat finale.
Let's have you practice with a monster first.{nl}Find a monster that is equal or inferior to yourself and let it attack you until you're almost at the limit, then defeat it.{nl}Do it only when you have no more than one-tenth of your health remaining.
Just be careful, this kind of training can be very dangerous.
Whenever you need to rest before your next training session, just come and talk to me.{nl}I can give you some food to recover your health. It takes about 5 minutes.{nl}Or, sit down to rest after eating the food and you'll be ready to go in only 3 minutes.
Here.{nl}Take this and get some rest.
Agility Training Management Orb
Attack the sword pell whenever the light blinks.{nl}Your attack count goes up by 1 if you hit the pell correctly for 3 consecutive times.{nl}Fail to hit it for 3 consecutive times and your count is reduced by 1.
Do you wish to proceed with your agility training?
Do you wish to continue your agility training?
Your training is complete.{nl}You have proven your ability in Retiarius combat, and you are now ready to move on to more advanced techniques.{nl}Come and see me if you're interested.
Agility training complete.
Retiarius, and similar gladiators like the Murmillo, gain passionate support from the spectators while in the arena. But in the moments before defeat, that support crumbles like a castle made of sand. 
As a gladiator I have witnessed this many times.{nl}And, rather than live by the cries of the crowd, I have survived by my own determination and have ended here.
After Medzio Diena, all the arenas were closed down.{nl}You could say gladiators were no longer needed.
But these days, you never know when the monsters or the demons are going to attack. The battle we fight now is worse than anything we ever faced in the arena.
Earth Tower Solmiki Area (Recommended Lv: 310) {nl}Only you and your party members can enter together.
Kupole Grisia
Zsaia!{nl}Oh, you're safe.
Kupole Zsaia
Grisia! I'm so glad you're here.{nl}What happened?
What happened to our sisters?{nl}How did the demons know we were here?
It's okay, Zsaia.{nl}I don't know how they found us either... But we need to save Velad and the other Kupoles.
Let's get out of here.{nl}This person is going to help us.
No! Think of all the effort it took to escape without getting caught by the demons... Don't you see, Grisia?
We can't run!{nl}We have to face them!
I'm not going to try and run only to have them catch me!{nl}If you want to run away, I'm sorry but you're on your own, Grisia!
I'm going to wake the sisters and get my revenge on the chasers, one way or another.
I sense a familiar energy in you.{nl}It's the energy of the goddess. I hadn't felt it in so long.
{nl}On Medzio Diena, we fought the demons in the front line for the Goddesses and their world.{nl}However, we weren't prepared for the demons led by Giltine.{nl}And many Kupoles were captured.
They sacrificed Kupoles to the Divine Tree.{nl}Our spiritual connection to the goddess was broken, and spirits and strength were absorbed by the Divine Tree.{nl}We gave up hope and were waiting for the painful end.
Then, somehow their restrainment got weaker and we took the chance to escape.{nl}But as you can see, they are trying to take us again.
You, receiver of the divine energy...{nl}Help us. Save the Kupoles.
The Kupoles suffered unbearable pain escaping from the Divine Tree.{nl}Most of the Kupoles are suffering after effects.{nl}This Kupole can't face the demons because of it.
And so am I.{nl}A half of my spirit is still restrained to the Divine Tree.{nl}I do not know when it will disappear.{nl}That is why I need to rescue as many Kupoles as possible while I can.{nl}However, even if the Kupoles are rescued, there is no way to protect them.
{nl}The Kupoles that were affected must be protected until they recover from the Tree's effects.{nl}Head to Baltinel Parish and collect the sacred relics that were once owned by the believers of this city.{nl}Those relics can be used to conceal the Kupoles from the demons.{nl}Only after that can we leave to search for the others.
We must find and protect the Kupoles as soon as we can.{nl}We don't know what they could have sacrificed in order to escape, but they will be vulnerable to the demons.{nl}If they catch them, there will be nothing we can do.
This should be enough to conceal the Kupoles.{nl}Thank you.
Thanks to you, our Kupoles are almost hidden completely from the demons.{nl}Unfortunately, many more are still in grave danger.{nl}I am well aware of the enormous burden this represents to you, human.{nl}But please, would you offer us your help once again?
The demons have installed a trap on Tabaras Street to catch us.{nl}Those demons are now gathered at the Pagal Market.{nl}Meanwhile, the Kupoles that got caught in the trap were sent to South Square.
Would you rescue them from the demons while I finish the process to conceal the others?
You are braver than I thought you would be.{nl}I'm sure the Goddess is looking after you.
You have rescued many Kupoles in Baltinel Memorial.{nl}Thank you so much.
I can sense another Kupole nearby.{nl}Her power is stronger than the others.{nl}She might be able to help with my plan.
I think that this aura is Zsaia's.{nl}She fought the demons with me on the front line on Medzio Diena.{nl}I believe she is being chased by the demons.
Zsaia seems to be surrounded by demons at Central Square.{nl}Unfortunately there isn't much I can do for her.{nl}Please, won't you help Zsaia?
Rescue Zsaia and I will have nothing more to ask of you.{nl}Please, save her...{nl}Please.
She is not here yet...{nl}But I sense something different of her.{nl}I don't know what happened to her.
Here she comes.{nl}I am so happy to meet my sister after all these years.{nl}It is all thanks to you.
Could you wait a moment while I talk to Zsaia?
Zsaia was not an aggresive Kupole like this.{nl}I think something has happened to her after escaping from the Divine Tree.{nl}I should follow her...
I need your help for a while longer.{nl}If you can... come to Gliehel Memorial with me.{nl}Please.
Rescued Kupole
Thank you for rescuing me with Grisia.{nl}There's so many things I can't remember.{nl}Who am I?
I need more time.{nl}But I can't think with these demons around me.{nl}Could you take care of them?
I can hear someone's voice.{nl}Is it the voice of the goddess I served?
I can feel someone calling me.{nl}But I don't know who...{nl}Thank you for helping me.{nl}
I remember something now.{nl}The things I was carrying... They were stolen from me by the demons at the Tabaras Parish...
{nl}That might bring back more memories.{nl}Would you help me?
My Goddess... I beg for you to save me...
Thank you!{nl}I remember Her semblance...{nl}A tall goddess with golden hair...
{nl}But who She was...{nl}Who I was...{nl}I can't recall at all.
{nl}Thanks to Grisia I am now hidden from the demons; I ought to go and find my belongings.{nl}Thank you.
{nl}If my memory returns, I will come to you first.{nl}I will see you then.
Thank you for staying with us.{nl}With your help, I'm sure we can rescue Zsaia and the other Kupoles.
{nl}Will you deter some of the demons nearby while I track their locations?
I can sense where they are, the same way Zsaia was able to the find the others.
It's going to take some time for me to track Zsaia.{nl}But I believe I found the other Kupoles!
The yard behind the Waterworks Office.{nl}There's a Kupole there waiting for your help.
Where are you Zsaia...
Thank you.{nl}I'll make sure they're hidden from the demons.
I think I've found Zsaia.{nl}She seems to be at the entrance of Gliehel Ranch.{nl}However... I believe there's a group of demons after her.{nl}You will have to defeat them before you can reach her.
Even if she attempts to break out, please make sure she isn't caught.
Why can't you understand how I feel... Zsaia.
Why is she so stubborn...{nl}I can't understand...
{nl}But it is too soon to give up.
She seems to be avoiding me.{nl}She must know I can sense where she is.
I must ask you again.{nl}Please look around the Central Parish Branch for Zsaia.{nl}And please, try and talk to her!
Grisia is nothing but delusional.{nl}Does she really think we can escape from the demons?{nl}And you're a fool...
I thought humans were more realistic...
{nl}Don't follow me.
We must rescue the Kupoles and return to the goddess...
This is our only hope.{nl}There's nothing we can do.{nl}So don't try to stop me!
So she's convinced...{nl}Well, I am terribly sorry.
I can't give up on Zsaia...{nl}You may think I'm foolish, but I can't help it.{nl}She's my sister, I treasure her too much.
Zsaia is on the roof of the Sanctuary.{nl}You may go first. I'll join you later.
I've already lost the goddess, I can't lose my sisters too...
We are too late.{nl}What should I do with Zsaia?
{nl}It's all my fault...{nl}Zsaia...
I knew this would happen...{nl}Maybe if we'd been together we would have escaped.
{nl}It's too late...
{nl}Look after my sisters...{nl}Help Grisia and Velad escape this place...{nl}I'm sorry I doubted you.{nl}Please, this is my last request...
{nl}Rescue them.{nl}
Too late...
{nl}My Goddess...
It's all my fault.{nl}We must rescue Velad.{nl}I can't let the same thing happen to her.
We need to protect Velad!{nl}Come with me to Frienel Memorial.{nl}
Did she not hear my voice?{nl}She's going to end up like Zsaia, running away like this.
I think I've found Velad.{nl}She's at the West Sanctuary.{nl}I believe she's waiting for someone.
Hurry!
If you find a Kupole in need, please help her.{nl}She may not have much time.
How much more will I have to regret in order to save my sisters?
Kupole Velad
So you're the one who was with Grisia.{nl}What are you up to? Hanging around a weak Kupole like her.{nl}Don't even think you can fool me.
Why do you keep following me?{nl}I'm busy.
It sounds like her condition is much worse than Zsaia's.{nl}She's not usually indelicate.{nl}We have no choice...
Even if I am to be caught and destroyed, I must get ahold of her.
{nl}Defeat the demons around the Birthplace of Frienel restoration site and retrieve their Neutralizing Orbs.{nl}They use the orbs to capture the Kupoles. They can use them to harm Velad, too.
Would the goddess have made a better choice...?{nl}I feel so lonely.
That's why I'm glad you're here.
Having a sister of mine disgraced like this grieves me beyond measure...{nl}But I want to save her.
Please deliver this Token to Velad.{nl}Tell her I will do as she wants.{nl}Ask her to return to me with the Token.
{nl}When she does...{nl}I will get ahold of her.
I can sense Grisia... You also have her Token...{nl}It must be true.
{nl}Even if it isn't, there's nothing you can do to stop me.{nl}I'll talk to her.
{nl}You can go now.
I can now understand why humans feel so frustrated.
May the goddess forgive me...{nl}Tell me when you're ready.
I know.{nl}I couldn't save anyone.{nl}Is this the end of it all...?
If only one of us Kupoles can survive this...{nl}If only we can find our goddess...
{nl}Please, sacrifice me and rescue Velad.{nl}Give her everything that is mine.
{nl}I feel terribly guilty asking you to do such a sad thing.{nl}But please.
No!{nl}What are you doing to her!
Because of you...{nl}Y...{nl}You...
{nl}I don't know why I'm doing this.{nl}I hate you and I wish there was something I could do.{nl}But I'm grateful...
It is all because of Grisia!{nl}She ruined everything!
{nl}Go back before I change my mind.{nl}I... I can't....
{nl}I just can't take this right now.{nl}Go back... Go back to wherever you belong.
{nl}Thank you.

Thanks to you, the Lieutenant is back and our new recruit is safe.{nl}I'm sorry we put you in such a tough spot, but you were a great help.{nl}
Words aren't enough to express how much we appreciate it.{nl}It might not be much, but I'd like you to take this gift. We're really thankful.{nl}
So, to find out what this box does you need to put all the items in it.{nl}Unfortunately we didn't have enough people to gather everything.{nl}
I'm afraid you'll have to look for some items yourself to fill up the box. Just look around, see what you can find.{nl}I hope it can be useful to you.
Thank you for helping Vaivora, and us Kupoles.{nl}We're humbled to witness a human like yourself display such a deep sense of sacrifice and courage.{nl}
We may have failed to protect the Revelation, but we are grateful, and we would like{nl}to offer you a small gift in the name of Goddess Vaivora and all Her Kupoles.{nl}
The true value of this box reveals itself only when the box is full.{nl}Although, as we are busy restoring the library, you may have to search for the objects to fill it on your own.
{nl}You may look for them near Valandis or Saugas, or obtain them by hunting demons nearby.{nl}I hope our gift will be useful to you, kind human.
Our reward items can be placed in your Team Storage or Personal Storage, but they cannot be traded.{nl}Would you like to receive the items now?
If you bring me 8 Ripped Book Pages, I can exchange them for one of my books.{nl}Come see me again if you have any questions or when you're ready to trade.
I see you have 8 Ripped Book Pages. Would you give them to me?{nl}I'm not just going to keep them, of course. I'll give you one of my books in return. 
Besides my work with important publications and Sage literature,{nl}I've also been gathering loose book pages and restoring them.{nl}
Unfortunately, the restoration process alone is extremely time-consuming. I have nearly no time left for anything.{nl}So I though up a way to gather the book pages I need without having to go out.{nl}
I am giving one of my books to everyone who can bring me a set of Ripped Book Pages.{nl}That way, those who are interested in books can get something they like, and I can collect more materials for my work.{nl}
If you're interested, feel free to bring me some book pages when you can.{nl}I have a few good books you might want to exchange for them.
Very well. Here's your book, for bringing me these beautiful pages.{nl}Come see me again if you collect another set of 8 pages, I have plenty more books to exchange.
Wait, hold on. There's something I want to give you. For all the times you helped me collect loose pages.{nl}Here, have this.
It's only a small gift, from one bibliophile to another.{nl}Come and exchange books whenever you can, I'll throw in a bookmark or two once in a while.{nl}
The box is for you to store the bookmarks.{nl}You see, something good will happen if you place all the bookmarks I give you in that box. Alright then, I'm looking forward to your next visit.
I'm glad to have you back. I've managed to speed the process so much thanks to you.{nl}By the way, have another one of those bookmarks I gave you last time. Alright, see you next time.
I'm sorry, but that's not enough to exchange for a book.{nl}Just a few more pages should be enough.
You found it? Are you serious? I thought I was the only one who knew about that place.{nl}And what's with that smirk? Did you find anything else?
Oh... You found that. Yeah, sometimes you'll find stuff like that when you're out and about.{nl}So, you know. You might find even more of those if you keep coming back for my riddles.{nl}
They're so pretty, it would be a shame to throw them away, right? That's why I got you this box.{nl}Just put all the things you find in here and, you know, something interesting might happen.
Oh, that box is where we keep all the beautiful treasures my little Dexter brings home.{nl}He must have liked you. I think he wants to give you a gift, the little fuzzball. Take it, then!{nl}
Come and play with little Dexter again, won't you? Maybe you'll get another gift from him next time.{nl}I quite like having people around so don't be shy, heh heh heh.
Look at little Dexter. He wants to play with you, heh heh heh.{nl}
If you want Dexter to notice you, you need to get close to his friends at the village.{nl}Then, go back to Dexter and see if you got the right answer!
Think carefully: how many times did little Dexter meow?{nl}That's as much as I can say. If I tell you any more, he's going to get grumpy.
Dexter hit a small box with his paw.
This seems right.
I think this is wrong...
Let's try again from the beginning.
Dexter looks calm and content. He doesn't look like he wants to play.
Dexter looks like he wants to play.
This one looks tired already. Let's try another one.
Dexter stopped meowing.
What's over here...?
You have no collection rewards to receive.
Choose the collection reward to receive.
You already have received the reward for this collection.
Could this be the place Anastazija talked about?
Thanks to you, the Lieutenant is back and our new recruit is safe.{nl}
I'm sorry we put you in such a tough spot, but you were a great help.{nl}Words aren't enough to express how much we appreciate it.{nl}
We had a little gift prepared for you, but it looks like you already one of those, heheh.{nl}Guess you don't need another one, then.{nl}
I'd say keep looking around the Lanko Waters Area if you're still missing anything, you're bound to find it somewhere.{nl}I really hope those things will be useful to you.
Thank you for helping Vaivora, and us Kupoles.{nl}
We may have failed to protect the Revelation, but we're humbled to witness a human like yourself display such a deep sense of sacrifice and courage.{nl}
We had prepared a small gift for you, but it seems you already possess it.{nl}I don't suppose you will want another.
If you are still searching for the objects, look around the Fantasy Library{nl}or defeat some demons nearby, you're sure to find something.
I pray that you'll find a good use for your box when it is complete.{nl}I thank you once again for the help you gave us, human.
We were humbled to witness a human like yourself display such a deep sense of sacrifice and courage.{nl}Thank you for your help, human. Goodbye.
That's the beauty of exploration, finding stuff like that.{nl}I'm not just trying to win this game, you know. I really want you to have fun traveling the world with my enigmas.{nl}
This game isn't over, buddy.{nl}Come back tomorrow and get served!
Suspicious Corpse
The corpse looks like it hasn't been dead for long.
It's strange that there's a corpse out here.{nl}Investigate?
The chest wounds look recent.{nl}It's best to investigate this person's identity.
{nl}Take a closer look?
You can place Magic Stones on the device.{nl}How many would you like to place?
Resistance Adjutant Bern
Did you see it too, Revelator?
A small girl made the magic circles shine with light!{nl}I'm not sure who she is, but...{nl}
If she can activate magic circles, she must be someone important.{nl}Did you perhaps notice any movement around the magic circles?
Resistance Deputy Commander Kron
I heard the water facility is functional again thanks to your work.{nl}We are very grateful.
{nl}I only have to worry about Ignas now.
You brought the purified water. Thank you.{nl}The giant monster was a Hydra.
{nl}We did manage to surround it...{nl}But it was too violent, we couldn't defeat it.
{nl}What's strange about it was that... even though it isn't a demon, it was giving off a very toxic energy.{nl}The kind that demons have.
{nl}I've been fighting the demons for years now, I know what they're like.{nl}Now that you're here, we need to move fast and defeat that Hydra!
Water Facility Management
Documents containing guidelines for the administration of the water facility.
1. The facility is activated by placing two Magic Stones in the Water Controller.{nl}2. The Magic Stones require periodic replacements.{nl}
In the event of a problem,{nl}the water facility must be reactivated. However, keep in mind that there are different ways to reactivate each area.{nl}
Reactivating Barynwell 85 Waters{nl}By order of the Controllers that are nearest to the water point, place 3, 2, and 1 Magic Stones in each device.{nl}
Reactivating Barynwell 86 Waters{nl}In a clockwise direction, place 1, 2 and 3 Magic Stones in each Water Controller.
The demons are approaching!{nl}Now, of all times...{nl}
Revelator, I understand this is a troublesome request... but would you take over the Hydra for a moment?{nl}
I'll handle the demons first and join you as soon as I can.{nl}You have my word!{nl}
Oh...! When you do face the Hydra, be sure to use the Purified Water!{nl}
Remember, the Hydra is carrying evil energy...{nl}There's a chance it might react with the Purified Water!
Resistance Adjutant Taylor
Revelator, we need your help!{nl}We're under attack by the demons!
{nl}All our soldiers are at the defense line...{nl}Our forces aren't enough to contain the attack!
{nl}We can't let them destroy our supplies...{nl}Please, Revelator. Help us.
{nl}We're counting on you!
Elder Henika
I heard that a Revelator was helping the resistance...{nl}And it was true.
{nl}This battle is between the Schaffenstar and the rebels.{nl}I hope you rethink your decision to help the resistance, or I will be forced to act.
Old Tombstone
This tombstone was erected by order of Lydia Schaffen upon the construction of the Astral Tower.{nl}The following are Schaffen's own words.
{nl}Should the Astral Tower ever find itself under threat, read the words engraved on this stone.{nl}May those who decipher their meaning rescue the Tower from danger.
Resistance Adjutant Lehon
A new magic circle appeared at the altar!{nl}Who would have known it was holding such a secret...
{nl}It seems the machines on top of the altar reacted with your fragments.
{nl}Would you have another look at the machines?{nl}I don't think I should do it myself.{nl}I'll stay behind if you need me.
There's a new magic circle!{nl}I knew that girl was up to something.
{nl}But I can't be sure of what to do with the circle...{nl}The girl said something about being at the same location and having the same color...
{nl}Ah...!
{nl}I wonder if we're supposed to make magic circles in the same spots become the same colors.{nl}The girl did say to use the disk; maybe we should try that.
{nl}How about you check on the magic circles?
You'll notice they're placed in the same spots from the altar.{nl}Not only that, those magic circles are also the same color, like the one that appeared at Senoves Altar.
You should try and match the color of the circles on each side.{nl}Circles on the same side should all have different colors.{nl}
This is all I can think of right now.
Goddess Laima Apparition
Savior. If you are seeing this message, the Astral Tower is in grave danger.
{nl}Ignas is the one responsible for it.{nl}He is using Demon Lord Solcomm, colluding with his subordinate Pbeta to overthrow the Astral Tower.
{nl}If you are to find another Revelation in the Tower, first you must help those who are just stand against Ignas.{nl}Only then will Revelation come to you.
{nl}Lydia Schaffen heard my prophecy. She gathered the right provisions to one day rid the Astral Tower of its threat.{nl}She kept in this very place an object that can reveal demons who disguise as humans.
{nl}They have already infiltrated the Astral Tower forces now siding with Ignas.{nl}You must use Schaffen's object to detect the demons among them.
{nl}May your efforts rescue the Astral Tower and free it from danger...
Resistance Commander Byle
So the demons were behind this entire ordeal...{nl}To even think they were disguised...
{nl}The demons must be stopped.{nl}I'll leave that up to you, Revelator.
{nl}We'll handle the enemy troops.
You can place stoned imbued with the energy of the lake on this Water Controller.{nl}How many stones would you like to place?
There's a controller on the altar.{nl}Operate it?
Ranger Morvio
There is no time to waste.{nl}We should get moving.
The arrows are ready.{nl}Let's go.
Did you see the girl?{nl}It must be the girl Byle was talking about.
They said she comes to help in important moments...{nl}I think she's trying to help us too!{nl}
That means you need to shoot at Pbeta's chest!
Morvio, you know I don't have enough arrows.{nl}And we don't even know who this girl is, how are we going to believe her?
I think the Revelator should decide.{nl}
You were blessed with the grace of the goddesses...{nl}They will lead you in the right direction.
The arrow went straight through his chest!{nl}He's definitely hurt now!{nl}
Things could get a little out of hand if Pbeta's subordinates show up...{nl}Morvio and I will keep an eye on the road.
We're counting on you!
Demon King Kartas
Pbeta.{nl}Look at you, trying to run away... pitiful.{nl}
I know you have part of Ziburynas' Essence.{nl}I wondered what you could have got from betraying Solcomm...{nl}
Don't you think that power is too much for you?{nl}
Hand over the power to me, Pbeta.{nl}It isn't something you can handle.
You already knew... Alright.{nl}
I'll hand over the power.{nl}But before that...
Are you trying to make a deal?{nl}Surely you know you're not capable of that?{nl}
Remember, I can destroy you at anytime, Pbeta.
If you're not willing to listen...{nl}The power of Ziburynas will not be yours forever.{nl}
Please, Kartas. My request is simple.{nl}Give me the power to end the Revelator and those who are after me.
If I can defeat them all...{nl}The power of Ziburynas will be yours, as promised.
Very well...{nl}I'll grant your wish.
But Pbeta...{nl}Don't even think about playing me.{nl}
Don't assume you can trick me like you did with Solcomm.{nl}
Remember. Once you defeat the Revelator and their group...{nl}You come back to me and hand over Ziburynas' power.{nl}
If so, I will cover for what you have done so far.
You ruined all my plans!{nl}You'll regret this...{nl}
I'll make you suffer!
You defeated Pbeta!{nl}Incredible!
Morvio told me what happened.{nl}
I noticed the evil energy was gone...{nl}Ziburynas' power must have vanished when Pbeta died.{nl}
I believe Elder Ramunas said Pbeta was only carrying part of Ziburynas' essence.{nl}That it was weaker than Ziburynas' energy.{nl}
Even so... I'm glad at least part of it is gone now.{nl}
Now all we have to do is take back the Astral Tower.{nl}
I believe you said you also have your own mission to tend to at the Tower...{nl}In that case, we'll head out to the Tower first and investigate.
Resistance Soldier Mait
Hey, I've never seen you before...{nl}Identify yourself.
A Revelator... I'm sorry if I was rude.{nl}Here in front is the temporary residence where the resistance soldiers live.{nl}
No unidentified persons are allowed beyond this point.{nl}And I'm afraid I haven't confirmed your identity yet.{nl}
Follow me. I need to report to my superiors first.
You can talk to Adjutant Bern.{nl}They'll be waiting for you.
Please to meet you. My name's Adjutant Bern.{nl}May I ask why you're here?
Going to the Astral Tower, you say?{nl}Hmm... I'm afraid it's not as easy as that.{nl}
As you can see, the areas surrounding the Tower are infested with demons and monsters.{nl}It's been like this ever since Ignas took command of the Astral Tower...{nl}
The demons are all over, but Ignas just seems to be ignoring the problem.{nl}Absolutely nothing is being done about it. It's an outrage!{nl}
In the end, we couldn't support Ignas' lack of action anymore so we formed our own resistance force outside the Tower.{nl}And now, most members who abandon the Tower suspect Ignas may have assassinated the former head of the organization.{nl}
I know we've only just met, and I'm so sorry to ask you this...{nl}But would you help us get back the Astral Tower?{nl}
If you do, we can help you get you to the inside of the Tower with no problems.
There are many soldiers out there in need of help.{nl}Please tend to them as much as you can.
We're slightly short-handed, so we're always busy, you see.
I see you handled all the urgent issues.{nl}Thank you.{nl}
Oh, and our Deputy Commander is looking for you.
Welcome. My name is Kron.{nl}I heard about how you've been helping our soldiers.{nl}
I would like to ask you for a special favor.{nl}
This lake has a network of Water Facilities installed across different points in the area.{nl}Originally, these facilities kept the demons away by imbuing the lake with properties similar to those of holy water.{nl}
Then, the facilities were destroyed by the demons...{nl}And now they have completely invaded the lake.{nl}
Fortunately we were able to protect one Water Facility in this district...{nl}But the water point isn't functioning the way it should.{nl}
The person responsible for gathering the resistance forces was Elder Ramunas.{nl}He was an advisor at the Astral Tower.{nl}
I believe he remembers looking at some documents related to the Water Facilities.{nl}
After talking to him, I gave orders to one of my subordinates to infiltrate the Astral Tower.{nl}The plan was to recover those Water Facility documents...{nl}
They should have reported back by now, but there are no signs of them.{nl}Would you find out what happened to them?
We need the documents if we're ever going to turn this situation around.{nl}I suggest you start with 86 Waters.
I can only hope they got the documents out...
Yes! These are the Water Facility Management documents!{nl}But where is my subordinate?
I see...{nl}It wasn't my intention to cause the death of one of our own...{nl}
However... on the memo it says the demons are running wild inside the Astral Tower.{nl}It seems Ignas was siding with them all along.{nl}
There's no doubt now that Ignas is colluding with the demons.{nl}Destroying the lake's Water Facilities was probably his idea.{nl}
After having a look at the documents, it looks like they contain all the instructions on how to reactivate the water points.{nl}
Only... the pages on how to create the protection circles have been ripped off.{nl}
We need Magic Stones to reactivate the water points.{nl}
There used to be a Magic Stone storage opposite the Water Facility...{nl}But that too was destroyed by the demons.{nl}
Would you go there and check whether there are any Magic Stones left?
The old storage was located opposite the Water Facility.{nl}Hopefully there will still be some Magic Stones left there.
Did you find any Magic Stones?
This should be enough.
To restart the water points, we need to place the right amount of Stones in each controller, and in the correct order.{nl}
The documents say we need to place 3, 2 and 1 Magic Stones in each controller, in the order of closest to furthest from the water point.{nl}
I think the demons might notice if I start moving around...{nl}Would you try and reactivate the water points yourself?{nl}
We'll be counting on you.
You need to place the Magic Stones on the controllers in the correct order.{nl}Make sure to check the number of required Magic Stones as well.
I followed you here just to make sure...{nl}That was close!
If you can get the water points working again, the demons won't be able to come near the lake anymore.{nl}You should go on and reactivate the facilities!
Like the Deputy Commander said...{nl}You need to add the Magic Stones in the correct order and number on the controllers for it to work.{nl}
If I remember correctly, the order was from closest to furthest from the water point.{nl}Each controller needs 3, 2, and 1 Magic Stones to reactivate.
Think carefully about the right order and number of Magic Stones!
Did you use all the Magic Stones?
Go and check whether the water points are reacting!
The protective magic circles are working!{nl}I'll go and report back to Deputy Commander Kron right away!
Do you have something to say?
A large monster seems to have appeared nearby.
I have something to ask you.{nl}If you can, would you gather some purified water near the water point?{nl}
I can't tell whether it's a regular monster or a demon...{nl}But if it is a demon, the purified water will help defeat it.
You can place the water inside this bottle.
If the monster really is a demon, it will react to the purified water from the water point.
You got the purified water.
The Deputy Commander is heading to the location of the monster.{nl}He must have been worried for the soldiers stationed there.{nl}
We should head out as well.
The monster is at the top of the Barynwell Watchtower.{nl}We should hurry.
Aren't you coming?{nl}We need to hurry!
Did you defeat the Hydra?
So the purified water was effective.{nl}Even so... what you did was remarkable. Not many people can defeat a Hydra all by themselves.{nl}
The water that flows from the water points only reacts to demons.{nl}
That means they must have done something to that Hydra.{nl}For now, let's return to the residence.
It's faster to go through 86 Waters.{nl}That's where our soldiers are facing Ignas' forces.{nl}
I already told the soldiers there about you, so you should be able to go through with no problems.{nl}
Oh, and if you do go through 86 Waters, Elder Ramunas will be at the assembly area.{nl}Please deliver these documents to him.{nl}
They need the documents to reactivate their own Water Facility.{nl}
Alright, take care.{nl}Thank you for all your help.
The moss growing around the lake makes it difficult for us soldiers to move around.{nl}The ground is too slippery, some of us even got hurt because of it.{nl}
But the moss is too much for me to remove it all by myself...{nl}Would you give me a hand?
Unfortunately there's no way to do it other than getting it out by hand.{nl}My job used to be clearing out the weeds, so I'm used to it.{nl}
We always have to be careful around the lake because the moss is so slippery.
You got most of it. Nice.{nl}I'll finish the rest. Thank you.
Resistance Soldier Molan
Did you see all the demons walking around?{nl}The soldiers are having a hard time because of them.{nl}
We're a little short-handed so I wouldn't dare to take care of them on my own.{nl}I know it's a difficult request, but would you give me a hand?
I wish I could go, but I'm the only soldier guarding this area...{nl}Be careful, then.
The demons took over when the water points stopped functioning...{nl}Hopefully they'll start working again soon...
I already see a lot fewer demons around!{nl}You're amazing.
It's been a long time since the demons invaded the lake.{nl}I'm worried that they'll contaminate the water.{nl}
I want to make sure the water isn't contaminated, but it's hard for me to move away...{nl}Would you go out and catch some fish from the lake for me?
Here's a net.{nl}If you can, collect a few lake fish near the Mazas Reservoir.{nl}
Oh, but make sure you look into the sections with fewer people.{nl}The lake fish like to gather in remote areas.
People around here drink purified water from the lake. If it gets contaminated...{nl}There's no telling what kind of side effects it could have.
This will be enough. Thank you.
Near the bottom of the Barynwell Watchtower grows a type of weed called Rias.{nl}It's harmless to us, but strangely it seems to keep the demons away.{nl}
I'm not sure if it actually repels them, but just to be sure I would like to find some.{nl}Would you collect some Rias Weeds for me?
Thank you.{nl}I need to keep an eye on our barracks, but I'll be counting on you.
There are Rias Weeds growing at the bottom of the Barynwell Watchtower.{nl}Look closely.
You brought a bunch!{nl}Let me see them.
They look like just normal grass.{nl}But they grow with the water from the lake...{nl}
Oh! I have an idea. Would you help me?
I'm thinking of a powder made from ground Rias Weeds.{nl}We should see if it has any effect on the demons.
If my guess is right, a Rias Weed powder could be really useful to us.
A-ha! Now I see why the demons never went near the Rias Weeds.{nl}They grow with the water from the lake.{nl}
Or they did, until the Water Facilities broke down...{nl}It looks like the purified water from the water point influences the Rias Weeds that grow there.{nl}
I need to make more of that powder and share it with the other soldiers.{nl}Thanks!
The first person to gather the resistance forces was Elder Ramunas.{nl}Some people also suspected Ignas was behind the assassination of the previous head of the Astral Tower...{nl}
In the end, the main reason was Ignas' lack of competence as head of the Tower.{nl}The lake was being filled up with demons and he did nothing to stop them.{nl}
Until this day, Ignas isn't doing anything about the demons.{nl}We're the ones fighting against them all over the region...{nl}
But we don't have enough means to face both Ignas' forces and the demons.
There are several Water Facilities installed all around the Starlit Lake.{nl}They were made to prevent demons from invading the region.{nl}
The water points are used to infuse the lake with something similar to holy water.{nl}The Water Facilities are operated by magic, so they are all managed separately from inside the Astral Tower.{nl}
Then, little by little, after Medzio Diena the demons started to invade the lake.{nl}Ignas didn't make much of it. He said nothing was going to happen.{nl}
I, too, trusted Ignas and thought the lake would be okay, but...{nl}In the end, the demons got ahold of the Water Facilities and destroyed them.{nl}
Those of us who felt like the problem was serious told Ignas that we should fight the demons and take back the Facilities...{nl}But he continued to act like everything was fine.{nl}
Outraged with Ignas' attitude, a group of members abandoned the Tower altogether, led by our Elder Ramunas.{nl}
We hurried to check on the Water Facilities as soon as we were out...{nl}But most of them had already been destroyed.{nl}
Luckily there was one Facility still remaining, and that was 86 Waters...{nl}Although we're still struggling to drive away the demons, since we can't restart the water point.
Resistance Soldier Rett
Who are you?{nl}This area is extremely dangerous. Go back now.
Oh! You're the Revelator.{nl}I heard about the work you did in 85 Waters.{nl}
Elder Ramunas is looking for you. He is in the assembly area.
Elder Ramunas
So you're the Revelator Kron told me about?{nl}
And these are the Water Facility Management documents.{nl}Very well. We should get our own Water Facility working soon with these.{nl}
Oh. My name is Ramunas, by the way.{nl}I heard all about what you did back in 85 Waters.{nl}
Getting the Water Facility working, defeating the Hydra...{nl}It can't have been easy. You're quite impressive.{nl}
But, um... I'm afraid the commander in chief isn't here right now.{nl}They left only a minute ago, so it's going to be a while until they're back...{nl}
While we wait, would you do me a favor?{nl}
Our resistance forces are being outnumbered.{nl}And Ignas' side is filled with talented fighters, so there's little we can do to stop them.{nl}
I was hoping you could help Taylor over there launch an attack on their rearguard.{nl}I know it's a lot to ask... but we really need your help.
Elder Ramunas is at the assembly area.
Nice to meet you. My name's Taylor.
Elder Ramunas said that?{nl}Hmm... alright.{nl}
We're a little short-handed anyway, we could use the help.{nl}But first, I want to ask you something.{nl}
We think Ignas' side set up traps at the assembly area without us noticing.{nl}One of our soldiers hurt his leg because of it.{nl}
Would you help dismantle and remove the traps?
This the tool we use.{nl}I wish I could go with you, but I need to go check on our supplies.{nl}
Oh, after you get all the traps, you can go see our Adjutant Lehon.{nl}
Lehon is out now doing recon for our next operation...{nl}But he's the one who developed this tool, if you show it to him he'll know what it is.{nl}
If you meet Lehon, help him prepare for the operation.
We're counting on you to get all the traps.{nl}It'll help us move around better.
Are you from the resistance?{nl}That tool you have... I recognize it.
A request from the elder, you say...{nl}Oh, I almost forgot to introduce myself. My name is Lehon.{nl}
Sorry if I suspected you.{nl}I'm a little on edge after going on that recon operation to Ignas' camp.{nl}
I was just preparing for the rearguard attack and...{nl}It seems the rearguard on their side are mostly neutral members.{nl}
If there was a way I could bring them over to our side...{nl}
Would you help us convince them? I'll tell you exactly what to say.{nl}I really think we can make at least some of them cross over.
They already know what I look like, but I think we can disguise you as a member of the Schaffenstar.{nl}You should be okay as long as you don't make a fuss.{nl}
Here's what you can say; listen carefully.
Did you finish talking to the members on the other side?
It looks like your work is done.{nl}Very well, let's carry on with the operation.
The rearguard on Ignas' camp has its fair share of supplies stocked up, I'm sure you saw them too.{nl}What I want you to do is spray this poison over their supplies.
The venom is inside this bottle.{nl}I'll be watching from down here.{nl}
Make sure no one is around when you do it. You don't want the others suspecting you.
Did you spray the poison on the supplies?{nl}It won't kill them, but it'll stop them for a while. 
That was great!{nl}Little by little the supplies should begin to poison them. Thank you.
There's dark smoke coming out of the assembly area.{nl}Something must have happened...{nl}
Would you check the area for me?
Hurry.{nl}The smoke is getting more intense!
It's a disaster!{nl}The demons attacked our rearguard!
All of our supplies are there!{nl}If the demons destroy them we're doomed!{nl}
Please, can you help us with the demons?
They attacked when there was no one at the assembly area...{nl}Hurry!
Move, now!
There's no doubt Elder Henika was one of the people colliding with the demons!{nl}
There were rumors saying Ignas had sided with them...{nl}I guess they were true.{nl}
I must tell Elder Ramunas.
I'm going there now!
Elder Henika...{nl}If Ignas really did side with the demons, it's plausible, yes.
There are two magic circles inside the Astral Tower leading to this area.{nl}Now, I know where those circles were installed, so I don't think Henika will have used them.{nl}
Not only that, our soldiers have an eye on that area at all times, they would have told us immediately if something happened.{nl}That means Ignas' side must have made a new magic circle to teleport here and attack us.{nl}
If they attacked the rearguard, the magic circle must have been near 85 Waters...{nl}Will you check if anything's there?
I'll give you this detector.{nl}You can use it to find any magic circles that may be hidden.{nl}
If you do find one, don't hesitate. Destroy it immediately.{nl}The magic circles we were watching must also be destroyed.
Alright, hurry out to 85 Waters.{nl}If there's any magic circle there, it'll be near the rearguard.
Very good.{nl}The other magic circles were also destroyed. They have no way to launch a sudden attack now.
And... there is something I should tell you.{nl}I heard this a long time ago, when I was still in the Schaffenstar, from the old head of the Tower.{nl}
They didn't say too much about it but...{nl}They mentioned that Lydia Schaffen kept certain... provisions around the Tower.{nl}
A kind of tool to use in case the Astral Tower was to face any sort of threat.{nl}Again, I don't know the details, but there's no doubt we could use something like that right now.{nl}
I mean, look at what's happening! The Tower's been completely taken by demons after Medzio Diena!{nl}As a Revelator, do you think you can find Schaffen's provisions?
Thank you for doing this.{nl}From what I remember, the way to find Schaffen's provisions began at the top of Rombas Hill Road...{nl}
My guess is that one of the provisions could be hidden in this area.{nl}You might find the clues for it will be on Rombas Hill Road.{nl}
It won't be easy recovering Schaffen's provisions... I suggest you take Lehon with you.
Elder Ramunas said that?
If he mentioned Rombas Hill Road, there must be something there...{nl}Oh! I remember seeing an old tombstone at the end of the road, could that be a lead?
We should investigate all the possible clues one by one.
So the secret really was in the tombstone... It only revealed itself because you approached it.{nl}May I see the disk?
This is only one half of the disk, I can't make out what it says...{nl}It only mentions the Senoves Altar.{nl}
There could be something hidden there!
This is the other half of the disk!{nl}To think something like this was hidden in the altar...{nl}
Let me have a look at the disk.
The disk says something is waiting at the Patogus Shelter.{nl}I don't know what exactly is waiting there... but we should find out! Let's go.
What is a little girl doing in a dangerous place like this...?{nl}And... what was she talking about?
I think she was talking about an altar and the disk...{nl}
Oh! There's an altar at the shelter. Should we try and place the disk there?
Let's go!
This means Lydia Schaffen's provisions were all a plan of Goddess Laima...
These Orbs could be the answer to our problems.{nl}
Go back to Elder Ramunas. Tell him about what happened and show him the Orbs.{nl}I'll clear the shelter first and join you later.
Go! You must tell Elder Ramunas about what we found!
Is this true?{nl}Schaffen's provisions were a plan of Goddess Laima...{nl}
And these Orbs, so full of divine energy...{nl}The commander arrived not long ago, he should know about this.
Did you speak with Elder Ramunas?
We finally meet. I heard all about you.{nl}My name's Byle.
Go ahead and speak to the commander.
Are you saying this Orb can detect demons disguised as humans?{nl}
I find it hard to believe there are actual demons on Ignas' side...{nl}But looking at what's happened so far, I do see the possibility.{nl}
The members siding with Ignas now will certainly change their minds if they find out.{nl}Imagine finding out the leaders of your camp were demons all along.{nl}
I have an idea.{nl}We plant these Orbs near the Raikinas Lowlands.{nl}
Then, we lure the demons disguised as humans out to the field...{nl}And we wait for the Orbs to react.{nl}
They might figure out we're up to something if I do it...{nl}If it's not asking too much, would you plant the Orbs yourself?
Planting the Orbs in three different locations should be enough.
Are the Orbs planted?
Good!
Now to lure out Ignas' demon commanders.
It's a success!{nl}You've done a great job, Revelator.
It's time to move on to the next area and take back the Astral Tower.{nl}Would you join me?
The water point of this region is also broken.{nl}Fortunately I think we can get it to work again with the documents you gave me.{nl}
I'm afraid we have no Magic Stones to operate the controllers.{nl}Though remember hearing they used to load them with stones carrying the energy of the lake in the past.{nl}
And the documents only say that the controllers need a means for the magic reaction...{nl}Maybe it doesn't have to be Magic Stones!{nl}
Besides, we have no time to waste. Some lake energy stones will have to do.{nl}
The Atskiras Lot has a lot of stones. Would you go and collect some for me?
I would go with you, but if I do the assembly area will have no one to look after it.{nl}I'm sorry. Good luck.
Did you look for the stones at the Lot?
This seems enough.
As you know from working on the other water points, you need to place the stones in a certain number and a certain order.{nl}
For our water point...{nl}It says 1, 2 and 3 stones per controller, placed clockwise in order.{nl}
Since you're already familiar with the water points, will you go and get ours restarted?
Oh, and about the magic circles for the Water Facility.{nl}The page in the document was ripped, so I couldn't tell for sure...{nl}
But if I remember correctly, you need to transform all the magic circles around the water point.{nl}And there's a type of preventive device... a trap, if you will.{nl}
If you see anything that looks like that, just try to avoid it.
Is the water point working now?{nl}Remember the right order and number of stones.
The water point is working now?{nl}That's good to hear, thank you.
The members on Ignas' camp are starting to doubt him after finding out they were siding with demons.{nl}
If we can convince them, they'll be a great help in taking back the Astral Tower.{nl}Would you give us a hand?
I do believe it will be more effective if you're the one who talks to them.{nl}Good luck.
Imagine how much stronger we'll be if we have all the members on our side.
You persuaded all the members.{nl}Thank you.
There are too many demons around, we can barely move.{nl}Would you clear the area for us?
I'll be here resting. Thank you.
Did you clear some of the demons nearby?
There are a lot fewer demons now.{nl}Thank you.
I heard a lot about you, Revelator.{nl}Commander Byle has just arrived, too. It seems the demon that's occupying the region is none other than Pbeta.{nl}
Oh, I almost forgot. My name is Morvio, I'm a student of the Ranger Master.{nl}She asked me to come and help the resistance soldiers, so here I am.{nl}
You may not know this, but the situation is very, very serious.{nl}
Pbeta has planted mind-controlling stones across the region to command the monsters.{nl}Apparently the strong energy of the stones is enough to completely hypnotize them.{nl}
You and Commander Byle should discuss what to do.
I'll be waiting.
Looks like you already met Morvio.{nl}Oort is also here to help the resistance soldiers.{nl}
They came to me not long ago and I sent them here to scout the area.{nl}There had been sightings of a high-rank demon nearby, so I thought we should investigate.{nl}
The demon is most likely Pbeta, who was rumored to have collided with Ignas.{nl}
As you know, we're a little short-handed...{nl}Not just to take over the Astral Tower, but to defeat Pbeta most of all.{nl}
Please, help the Master's students defeat Pbeta.
Have you talked to Commander Byle yet?
We can't refuse an order from Commander Byle.{nl}Let's go.
I wonder if my request wasn't too much for you and the students.
If we're going to get to Pbeta, first we need to destroy his mind-controlling Magic Stones.{nl}That will at least keep the monsters away from us.{nl}
Would you start by doing that?
Before destroying the stones, use this Absorbing Stone to soak up the evil energy of Pbeta's Magic Stones.{nl}
There's no telling how Pbeta's stones will react if you try to destroy them while the energy is still flowing...{nl}
I wish I could come along, but I'm afraid the monsters will tell we're up to something if we go together...{nl}Good luck.
The energy of Pbeta's Magic Stones is spreading throughout the entire region.{nl}I never felt anything like this.
You destroyed the Magic Stones!{nl}But now... the energy coming from the Absorbing Stone is creeping me out.{nl}
I'll think of a way to dispose of the energy.
Did you feel the energy that was spreading around here?{nl}The evil energy you took with that Absorbing Stone!{nl}
You know, they keep very dangerous things deep inside the Astral Tower.{nl}Including the essence of Ziburynas, the demon lord who was defeated by Lydia Schaffen.{nl}
I saw it once, when I was working inside the Tower.{nl}I'll never forget the awful energy I felt then.{nl}
But now... I can feel it again! It's the same energy, spreading all over the region!{nl}What if... Ignas took the essence of Ziburynas and gave it to Pbeta?{nl}
You might have heard that Lydia Schaffen killed Ziburynas with a powerful arrow called the Flechette.{nl}Maybe the Fletcher Master can help us find a way to fight Ziburynas' essence.{nl}
If that's alright with you, would you pay a visit to the Fletcher Master?
He should be at the Goddess' Ancient Garden.{nl}
Oh, and it seems he sent one of his students over to help, but they're still nowhere to be seen.{nl}I wonder if something happened... Do check with the Fletcher Master.{nl}{nl}
The essence of Ziburynas... This is very serious.
Did you visit the Fletcher Master yet?
Yes, Lydia Schaffen killed Ziburynas a long time go.{nl}But do you know how she did it? It was all thanks to the Flechette, a mighty arrow created by my ancestors.{nl}
I have yet to find it but... I did my research on it.{nl}I found a way to produce an arrow that's almost as powerful as the original Flechette.{nl}
I can hand you the instructions. Please deliver them to my student.
It's already been a few days since he left...{nl}If you go now, he should be there when you arrive.{nl}
And make sure you keep an eye on that Earth Essence. My student didn't take any, so it's very important that you don't lose it.{nl}
Those are some great things he handed you.{nl}And his student is here, too.{nl}
Go and give him the things.
Did you give everything to the Fletcher Master's student yet?
The Master gave these to you?
The student arrived just after you left.{nl}Looks like you just went different ways.
It looks like the situation is serious, from these instructions.{nl}I heard a big demon was in the area.{nl}
An arrow like this would be extremely helpful to face a demon like Pbeta...{nl}But I'm missing the materials for the arrowhead.{nl}
I did notice some natural Obsidian on the way to 86 Waters.{nl}If we're lucky, they could contain some magic...{nl}
I think I can make a good arrowhead with some of that Obsidian.{nl}If it's not asking too much, would you collect some for me?
I'll be preparing the tools to process the mineral meanwhile.{nl}Thank you.{nl}
Did you bring the Obsidian?
This is enough.{nl}Thank you.
Come to think of it, I'm also short on materials for the fletching.{nl}But I believe there are Humming Dukes nearby...{nl}
Humming Duke feathers are flexible but durable. They'll make for good fletching materials.{nl}Would you collect some for me?
Thank you.{nl}I'll go ahead and make the arrowhead first.
Please make sure the feathers don't get damaged, otherwise I can't use them.
That's a lot of feathers.{nl}I'll have to throw away some of the long white ones, but the rest look good enough to use for the fletching.{nl}
Just wait for a moment while I craft the arrow.
Hunter Oort
Sorry I didn't introduce myself earlier. I'm Oort.{nl}My Master sent me out here to help the resistance soldiers...{nl}
But it looks like we're going to have to face Pbeta now. Is that right?{nl}Won't we have to deal with his subordinates as well? I think we should prepare for that.{nl}
There's a highly poisonous plant growing near the old garden called Ziburyte.{nl}Would you bring me some?{nl}
I can use the Ziburyte to make a series of traps for Pbeta's subordinates.
I'll stay here and prepare the other tools for the traps.{nl}Just be careful when collecting the Ziburyte. It's very poisonous.
Where's the Ziburyte?{nl}Please, hurry.
You're back!{nl}Hold on a moment.
The traps are ready.{nl}Please set them up on the way to Pbeta's location.{nl}
The poison in these traps is very strong. It should be enough to hit even very large monsters.
Oh, it looks like Voleta is done with the arrows.{nl}You can take Morvio and Voleta, then.
After you set up the traps, make sure to avoid the area.{nl}The poison will start spreading immediately if one of them is triggered.
All the traps are in place now?
Alright, let's move.{nl}We should hurry, in case Pbeta tries anything.
Be careful not to let Pbeta find out we're after him.
Revelator, have you made your decision?{nl}Whatever you think is best, we'll follow.
Understood.{nl}I'll fire the arrow as soon I see Pbeta.{nl}
Morvio is going to stay and look out for Pbeta's subordinates.{nl}Let's go, then.
I'm sorry. Pbeta escaped, there was nothing we could do.{nl}
Voleta was hurt trying to stop Pbeta.{nl}We should go first and reunite later.{nl}
Now, I think Pbeta stepped on one of the traps when he escaped.{nl}That means it will be easier to follow him.{nl}
We need to track him down.
Let's go back to the traps and look for clues!
The trail ends here.{nl}There are no more traces.
I think he escaped to the Astral Tower.{nl}Ignas' men will be all over the entrance to the Tower... it won't be easy.{nl}
Revelator, would you go after Pbeta?{nl}I'm going to call for help.
Good luck.
Thank you for everything.{nl}
This is as far as we can come with you, Revelator.{nl}I'm afraid our purpose here doesn't relate to the Astral Tower, there's nothing more we can do to help.{nl}
Commander Byle also said that...{nl}You have something to do in the Astral Tower.{nl}
I don't know what you'll be doing in there, but be careful.{nl}The other students and I are going to stay here for a while.{nl}
There are still demons roaming around in the area, we'll go ahead and get rid of them.{nl}I'll see you another time.{nl}
May the goddess protect you, Revelator.
Revelator, may I ask you for a favor?{nl}
I'm out of food to give to Inas.{nl}Would you hunt some Humming Dukes for me? I could really use some meat.
I would hunt them myself but...{nl}Inas is just too hungry. He's refusing to cooperate.{nl}
I'll be very grateful.
Please hurry.
Thank you.{nl}I should hurry and feed Inas now.
I just realized I'm out of water, too.{nl}I think I saw some Pasto water plants nearby.{nl}
Pasto plants are known to act as purifiers; I think I can use them to filter some lake water.{nl}Would you collect some water plants for me?
Pasto plants grow underwater, however, so they're hard to spot with the naked eye.{nl}But check the surface of the water for bubbles, you should find them there.{nl}
Inas is still a little sensitive, I'm going to have to stay with him for a while.{nl}Thanks for the help.
Did you bring the plants?{nl}I'm getting thirsty already.
Thank you!{nl}This should work for a while.
It took me years, but thanks to you I finally got hold of it.{nl}After you found the Flechette I did my fair share of research on it.{nl}
And through that research, I found a way to create an arrow as powerful as the Flechette.{nl}
I know there are other people helping the resistance soldiers from the outside.{nl}My Master was apparently an acquaintance of Elder Ramunas' from the old days.{nl}
I don't know who is helping or how, exactly...{nl}But I assume most of them either worked at the Astral Tower or know someone who did.{nl}
As you know, the resistance needs soldiers to fight for them, but most of all they need the funds to support themselves.{nl}My guess is that a lot of people are helping with donations.
But officially, Ignas is the rightful head of the Astral Tower, and we aren't connected to their organization...{nl}We have no place in the battle between Ignas and the resistance.{nl}
I heard all about what he did from the soldiers, but we just don't have the same responsibility.{nl}All we can do is help indirectly like this.
Elder Ramunas
You probably already heard the story of how Lydia Schaffen defeated Demon Lord Ziburynas.{nl}The story of Schaffen and her Flechette.{nl}
After Ziburynas was defeated, Schaffen commanded that the demon's essence was kept in the Tower.{nl}Ziburynas' essence was too dangerous. She didn't want it to fall into the hands of another demon.{nl}
And she made the right decision.{nl}Many demons have tried to attack the Tower, but all of them failed.{nl}
The rumor went that the Tower was better protected than the royal palace. And that's saying something.{nl}
I saw Ziburynas' essence once when I worked at the Tower.{nl}They used to move it around every now and then to keep it safe.{nl}
And let me tell you, the energy coming from that essence was evil. Terrifying.{nl}Looking at it felt like falling from an abyss.{nl}
I thought the essence would be safe as long as it was kept in the Tower...{nl}Never in my dreams did I think it would be stolen from the inside.{nl}
It was Ignas' fault, of course. He sided with the demons.{nl}The head of the Astral Tower, that is.
We abandoned the Astral Tower so we could take it back from Ignas.{nl}He isn't fit to be head of the Tower. 
I head the water point is working again!{nl}That's great news!
I have no doubt Ignas had something to do with the death of the previous leader.{nl}Nothing works anymore ever since he became head of the Tower.
There are even rumors that he's colluding with the demons.{nl}Although not everyone seems to think it's true...
Now that the water point is working, the demons will have to leave the lake.{nl}Of course, it will be a while before all the water is purified...
The Hydra is monster, but not a demon.{nl}Why did it react to the purified water? 
When we first abandoned the Tower, the lake was full of demons.{nl}We managed to clear out the area a little now, but I had no idea the situation was this serious.
I'm glad the water point is working again.{nl}Hopefully we'll be seeing fewer demons around now.
The water points were destroyed while we were still working in the Tower.{nl}For all we know, Ignas could very well be behind all of this.
The other areas have their own Water Facilities.{nl}If we can make all of them work again, the lake will be purified in no time.
All that's left to do now is to take back the Astral Tower.{nl}We're ready to join the commander of 86 Waters.
Resistance Soldier
I'm worried for everyone, but especially the soldiers in 86 Waters.{nl}They have to fight directly against Ignas' camp; the casualties there are higher than anywhere else.
I heard you got the Water Facility to work again.{nl}You don't know how that makes things easier for us.
Be careful when you go to 86 Waters.{nl}If they don't know who you are, you could get yourself into trouble.
Some members of the Astral Tower still haven't taken a side.{nl}My guess is that they're only trying to save themselves.
Commander Kron seems to think Ignas made a deal with the demons.{nl}When you think of everything that's happening, I'd say he's right.
On Medzio Diena, this entire region was overturned.{nl}Many roads and buildings were destroyed because of it.
I hesitated to abandon the Tower at first.{nl}I wasn't ready to stand against the people I considered my peers. 
I heard there are other people supporting us from the outside.{nl}If it wasn't for them... I don't think we'd be able to support ourselves.
This is a conflict zone between Ignas' army and the resistance.{nl}Please refrain from any unnecessary movements.
I'm injured. I can't move like this.{nl}I'm going to have to rest for a while.
We abandoned the Tower to make our own resistance army but... we're still outnumbered.{nl}If only we could get the neutral members to cross over to our side...
We sent a few scouts to the Lanko Waters region... no news from them yet.{nl}They should be back by now...
I can't imagine if Lydia Schaffen were alive to see this...{nl}Our own family split into sides, fighting each other.
Lydia Schaffen's provisions are hidden somewhere in the region.{nl}They could very well be the solution to our problem.
So it's true. Ignas is on the demons' side.{nl}Did he use their influence to become head of the Tower?
Most resistance soldiers are on the front line, fighting against Ignas' army.{nl}To think we all started out as brothers...
Ignas' camp is more numerous than we expected.{nl}If they ever launch a full-scale attack, there's little we can do to stop them.
Ignas had no consideration for the members working in the Astral Tower.{nl}He lost all credibility as a leader.
I don't see any more of Ignas' men around.{nl}We should take care of the demons instead.
I don't know what Lydia Schaffen's provisions are but...{nl}I hope it's something we can use.
Ignas' camp has set out a defensive front line.{nl}Something feels very strange about their commander.
I heard about the strange girl before.{nl}Who would have thought she would appear again to recover Schaffen's provisions...? 
I always suspected Ignas was involved with the demons.{nl}If that's true, the other members need to know about it.
All that's left to do now is return to the Tower.{nl}Ignas' side is no longer sending out its members.
I know one of the scouts that were sent out to Lanko Waters.{nl}There's no news about them yet... I just hope they're safe.
May I know what you're doing here?{nl}You don't look like a soldier... This area is dangerous, you should leave immediately.
What on earth are you doing here?? You need to get out!{nl}This is a war zone, you could get killed out here!
You defeated a demon that was disguised as a human?{nl}Wow, that's amazing.
Can you feel the energy spreading?{nl}I never felt such an evil energy.
I'm going to move on to another region.{nl}Get rid of some more demons there.
Somewhere in this region is Pbeta, the demon Ignas is siding with.{nl}I still can't understand why he would do such a thing.
I'd say Ignas probably gave away Ziburynas' essence to Pbeta.{nl}The man has to be out of his mind to do something like that.
I can't help but be amazed at the fact that the Fletcher Master created an arrow like this.{nl}This could really help us defeat Pbeta.
I'm glad the arrow was effective.{nl}I think I'll stay here for a little longer and tend to my wounds.{nl}
I wish I could join you, but I need to recover...{nl}I wouldn't be able to enter the Astral Tower anyway...
From what I was told, Ignas was behind the death of the previous head of the Tower.{nl}I don't know if that's true, but those were the rumors.
I'm glad my traps were useful.{nl}If it wasn't for them, we would never be able to track Pbeta. 
Pbeta must have been carrying part of Ziburynas' essence.{nl}It's good that at least part of it is gone now.
The evil energy is spreading throughout the entire region.{nl}If Pbeta is the source of this energy... our job won't be easy.
I heard Pbeta is carrying a very powerful source of energy...{nl}We can only hope Voleta's arrow works.
Pbeta was hurt by the traps and Voleta's arrow...{nl}It's only a matter of time now before he's defeated!
I'm sure the arrow will work.{nl}As long as Pbeta stays in the dark, we have a real chance of getting to him.
Aghh... I'm sorry, I don't think I can go on like this...{nl}Go, Revelator. Go and defeat Pbeta.
This entire region was overturned on Medzio Diena.{nl}A lot of roads were destroyed because of that.
The villages around the lake were all affected by Medzio Diena.{nl}All the members that had family in those villages were so worried.
There's a controller device between the two magic circles.{nl}Maybe the controller needs to be operated in a certain way.{nl}
Looking at the first magic circles, they seem to have the same color.{nl}
If we can use the controller to change the color of the magic circles...{nl}How about we try setting them all to different colors?
What you did was remarkable.{nl}I say your talent is impressive, even for a Revelator.
The tombstone contains faint inscriptions and the image of an offering. 
Devout heart, lay before you the blue crystal and be blessed.
Devout heart, lay before you the red crystal and be blessed.
Devout heart, lay before you the yellow crystal and be blessed.
Magic Circle
The spheres are beginning to react with the magic circle.
Red Crystal Orb
An unknown energy is slowly emanating from the crystal orb.{nl}Inspect the orb?
Old Pillar
The wandering spheres are beginning to react with the old pillar.
This pillar has a strange kind of energy.
There's an old pillar here.
There doesn't seem to be a reaction.
The spheres shine brighter when they are closer to the pillar.{nl}Inspect the pillar?
Damaged Stone Plate
There's an image engraved on the stone plate.{nl}The full image only becomes visible when all the plates come together.
Damaged Monument
There's a damaged tombstone.
The stone plates are slowly starting to form an image.
It looks like the image of a person moving.{nl}Try a few gestures in front of the tombstone.
There's an image on the tombstone, but because of the holes it's impossible to make out.
The stone plate looks like it fits in the tombstone.{nl}Try it?
Try a few more gestures in front of the tombstone.
Small Firestone
The Firestone is hovering around.
Old Lantern
The Firestone was sucked into the old lantern and began to react.
There's an old lantern.
The Firestones are burning hot.
The Firestone was sucked into the lantern, but there was no reaction.
Oh, it's nice to see you.{nl}If you aren't busy, would you mind giving me a hand?
Alright, I understand.
Would you happen to know about the Onmyoji?{nl}They arrived in our nation around the Kingdom's millenary to assist in the royal court.{nl}
Now it seems the Onmyoji Master is in a bit of a difficult situation.{nl}His country is using his status to make some rather unreasonable demands to our Kingdom.{nl}
The Master's nation was also affected by Medzio Diena, you see...{nl}And according to them, the fact that the disaster started in our capital is reason enough for them to demand material aid.{nl}
Their requests are certainly excessive...{nl}But if you consider all that the Onmyoji have done for the Kingdom and its subjects, it's hard for us to refuse, don't you think?{nl}
I've asked a few acquaintances to help the Onmyoji Master gather relief material for his country.{nl}Fortunately, most of them were glad to cooperate.{nl}
Now, the Onmyoji Master left to visit his home country and announce our assistance, but it seems he'll be returning to the Kingdom a little earlier than expected.{nl}
If you don't mind, would you pay a visit to the supporters and check on their progress?{nl}I'm afraid we need to gather the relief supplies as soon as possible.
That's very kind of you.{nl}I'll hand you a list of the supporters. The list includes details on the location and type of donation of each supporter.
Pay a visit to each of the supporters on the list and take note of their progress.{nl}I'll confirm the supporters that aren't included in the list.
List of Supporters
Uska's list of supporters for the Onmyoji nation.
Klaipeda's Item Merchant{nl}Has agreed to donate clothing articles.
Klaipeda's Item Merchant{nl}Has agreed to donate lumber.
Druid Master Gina Greene{nl}Has agreed to donate mushrooms for cultivation.{nl}Location: Fedimian
Druid Master Gina Greene{nl}Has agreed to donate grape seeds for cultivation.{nl}Location: Fedimian
Lord of Orsha{nl}Has agreed to provide accommodation for refugees.
Corsair Master{nl}Has agreed to arrange a ship for the transportation of donated goods.{nl}Location: Akmens Ridge
Plague Doctor Master{nl}Has agreed to donate medical supplies.{nl}Location: Istora Ruins
Kedora Alliance - Leopoldas{nl}Has agreed to provide relief funds.{nl}Location: Manahas
Druid Ellie{nl}Has agreed to donate grain and cereals.{nl}Location: Greene Manor
Oh, you're here to check on the supplies for the Onmyoji Master.{nl}
He's returning sooner than expected?{nl}Oh my, what do I do...? I didn't have time to gather all the clothing I need to donate.{nl}
There's no way I can get everything by the time he arrives...{nl}
Would you maybe help me collect some materials?
Oh, thank you!{nl}
I hear there are a lot of Saltisdaughters roaming around the Fortress of the Land in the Extension area, the Roxona Marketplace, Inner Enceinte District and Vedas Plateau.{nl}You should be able to get a good amount of Saltisdaughter Fur from them.{nl}
I'm going to need about 100 Fur Pieces for my donation.{nl}Alright then, good luck!
To make 100 Fur Pieces you're going to need Saltisdaughter Fur.{nl}The monsters usually roam around the Fortress of the Land in the Extension area, the Roxona Marketplace, Inner Enceinte District and Vedas Plateau.
This should be enough to finish my donation.{nl}Thank you so much for your help.{nl}
You can let Uska know that my clothing donation is on schedule.
I'm so glad I can keep my promise and donate a good amount of clothes to the Onmyoji nation.
He's returning sooner than expected?{nl}Oh my, what do I do...? I didn't have time to gather all the lumber I need to donate.{nl}
The wood is arriving from East Siauliai Woods, you see.{nl}But the lumberjacks can't always find the people to transport that much material, not to mention the distance it has to travel.{nl}
There's no way I can get all the lumber by the time the Onmyoji Master arrives...{nl}
If that's alright, would you help me collect the rest of the lumber?
Oh, thank you!{nl}The lumber will be in a pile in East Siauliai Woods.{nl}I would need you to bring back about 150 pieces of Dry Wood.{nl}
Thank you for the help!
The lumber will be in a pile in East Siauliai Woods.{nl}I need you to bring back about 150 pieces of Dry Wood.{nl}
This should be enough, yes.{nl}Thank you so, so much.
You can let Uska know that my lumber donation will be ready in time.
I'm glad you were here to help me gather the wood for my donation.{nl}Thank you.
Oh, did Uska send you?{nl}Yes, I agreed to gather a few mushroom samples for the Onmyoji nation.{nl}
I've been looking everywhere for different mushroom species that can be cultivated...{nl}But most of the mushrooms I found were contaminated.{nl}
There are a few locations I still need to check...{nl}
If it's not asking too much, would you go there and collect a few samples for me?
Thank you, that's very kind of you.{nl}You can look for the mushroom samples in Poslinkis Forest.{nl}
The mushrooms there give off a peculiar blue glow. Look for that and you will find the mushrooms.{nl}
I would need about 15 Mushroom Samples for my donation.{nl}I can check the other locations myself meanwhile.
Please collect about 15 Mushroom Samples from Poslinkis Forest.{nl}The mushrooms there give off a peculiar blue glow, so look for that and you will find the mushrooms.{nl}I can check the other locations myself meanwhile.
You have the Mushroom Samples!{nl}
Let me check that they aren't contaminated.{nl}It'll only be a moment.
I'm not entirely aware of what the situation is like in the Onmyoji nation...{nl}I'm guessing only part of the land will be fit for cultivation at the moment, but I believe these mushroom samples will be useful in the long run.
Uska sent you over to talk to me...?{nl}Oh, right! What was I thinking?{nl}I agreed to help Uska gather relief goods for the Onmyoji nation.{nl}
There's no time to collect the grape seeds I promised...{nl}Not to mention how long it takes to check for contamination.{nl}
I didn't mean to bother you, but would you go and collect the grape seeds for me?{nl}
I heard about your good deed in Greene Manor.{nl}But I need to make sure the seeds aren't contaminated.
I didn't mean to bother you, but would you go and collect the grape seeds for me?{nl}
Thank you, that's very kind of you.{nl}You can collect the seed samples in Greene Manor.{nl}
Look in the mounds near the Avarza Grape Farm and Ziura Junction.{nl}But make sure not to disturb the farmers' grape fields.
I will need about 15 Grape Seed Samples.{nl}
I'll prepare for the contamination tests meanwhile... Thanks again for agreeing to help me.

Ah, yes, you came to see me about the support for the Onmyoji nation.{nl}
I promised Uska I would provide accommodation for the refugees.{nl}I've arranged a land lot for the camp, and I've also requested the materials for the tents at the Orsha Item Merchant.{nl}
I asked the boy to let me know as soon as the tent materials were ready...{nl}If you can, do confirm with the Item Merchant.
Do confirm whether the tent materials are ready at the Orsha Item Merchant.
Oh boy... we're in trouble.{nl}I was just about to tell Lady Hamondale we're still short on rope.{nl}
Everybody's using rope these days...{nl}It's hard to keep enough of it in stock.{nl}
I'm really sorry to ask you this but... would you help find some rope?
Wow, really? Thanks!{nl}
Do you know the Ducky monsters of Sunset Flag Forest and Khamadon Forest?{nl}You can get some really good leather from them.{nl}
I would need you to make about 100 pieces of Processed Leather with the Ducky Leather.{nl}Alright, then!
The Ducky monsters live in the Sunset Flag Forest and Khamadon Forest.{nl}I need you to get some of their leather and make me 100 pieces of Processed Leather.{nl}
Plant stems make for some really durable rope, but they take so long to collect...{nl}Our best bet is probably leather rope.
Yup, this should be enough!{nl}
You can tell Lady Hamondale the tent materials will be ready in no time!
All I need are the materials, the rest is a piece of cake!
I'm glad to hear everything is ready.{nl}You may tell Uska we'll finish all the preparations in time.
We're still slightly short-handed... but I'll make sure everything goes as planned.
Support for the Onmyoji nation, you're saying?{nl}
Aye. I got a request for it a while back.{nl}I asked around and I found me a captain who can get the goods over to them.{nl}
But I don't know, he isn't lookin' too cheery.{nl}I think he said he lost some sort of brooch, was it?{nl}
But trust me, he's the man ye want.{nl}I'm only tellin' you this because I want to help.{nl}If ye need him, he'll be around Rasvoy Lake.
The ol' bandit will be somewhere around Rasvoy Lake. Couldn't tell ye where, exactly.
Pirate Captain Lowe
You got something to say to me?
Is that so...?{nl}The Corsair Master told you to come see me?{nl}
Well, I got no time to be helping you right now.{nl}I lost something that belongs to my wife.{nl}
I looked all over this darned place...{nl}Those filthy Brown Lapasapes must have stolen it from me.{nl}
But let's say you whack the little mutts and find my wife's brooch.{nl}I'd be a whole lot more interested in helping you out. How's that sound?
Now we're talking. I know the brooch has to be either here in Rasvoy Lake or the Oasseu Memorial.{nl}One of the Brown Lapasapes is gonna be carrying it.{nl}
It's a purple brooch, you can't miss it. You find it, you bring it back, understood?
Just get the Brown Lapasapes in Rasvoy Lake and Oasseu Memorial.{nl}If you see them drop the brooch, you bring it right back to me, got it?{nl}
Remember, it's a purple brooch!
O-ho! That's it, right there! That's the brooch!{nl}I knew it was those Lapasapes, the filthy rats.{nl}
Right, right. You said you needed me to sail a ship, was it?{nl}
A trip like that isn't cheap, you know?{nl}But alright. Since you found me the darned brooch.{nl}
Just let the Corsair Master know, will you?{nl}Not a lot of captains are up this job, you know? I'll do him the favor.
You can let the Corsair Master know I'm sailing the ship.{nl}You're lucky my mood's right again after I got that brooch back.
50 monsters later, the captain's brooch is still nowhere to be found.{nl}But it's still too early to give up. Keep trying.
That's more than 100 monsters now.{nl}But the captain is certain the brooch is with the Brown Lapasapes, so keep trying.
The Brown Lapasapes seem to have turned more violent.{nl}Is it because of the smell of blood?
Found an object that looks like the captain's brooch.{nl}Go back to him and return the brooch.
Ye solved everything with Lowe, did you?{nl}Aye. Tell Uska he's got his captain.
Ho ho. Got the old scallywag chirping again, ready to sail.
Oh, you're here to check on the supplies for the Onmyoji Master.{nl}
I'm almost done preparing all the medical supplies for the donation...{nl}But there is one thing I'm missing.{nl}It's a type of blood circulation supplement I'm trying to produce. Unfortunately I still don't have all the materials for it.{nl}
It's going to take some time for me to gather everything...{nl}Although, if you can find me some Hard Thistles, that would cut it down by quite a lot.{nl}What do you say?
Hard Thistles are found in Barha Forest and Nahash Forest.{nl}I'd like you to bring back about 15 Hard Thistles.{nl}
If you can't find them at first, look for the purple spots.{nl}The thistles in those regions contain a substance that makes them glow in a very characteristic shade of purple.{nl}
I'll gather the rest of the materials meanwhile.
Hard Thistles are found in Barha Forest and Nahash Forest.{nl}I'd like you to bring back about 15 Hard Thistles.{nl}
The thistles in those regions contain a substance that makes them glow in a very characteristic shade of purple, so look out for the purple spots.
Excellent. These are exactly the kind of Hard Thistles I was looking for.{nl}Thank you.{nl}
Revelator, would you mind doing me another favor?{nl}
In my research camp just down the road I have four piles of boxes with medical supplies.{nl}They're all set to be shipped, but I think I have their quantities mixed up.{nl}
While I'm working on the blood circulation supplement, would you go there and check the stock of each supply?
The supply boxes are at my research camp.{nl}Just check the amount of each type of supply in the four box piles.
Did you count all the supplies?
Medical Supplies
Fever Medicine - 1,460{nl}Small Bandages - 2,970
Antiseptic - 1,630{nl}Pain Medication - 2,150
Ointment - 2,470{nl}Antihemorrhagic Drug - 1,390
Large Bandages - 1,850{nl}Bandaids - 2,260
How many doses of fever and pain medication were there in total?
How many doses of antihemorrhagic drug and antiseptic were there in total?
How many doses of ointment and bandaids were there in total?
How many small and large bandages were there in total?
Those numbers are slightly different from what I had noted.{nl}Would you mind checking one more time?
Ah, yes. The numbers seem right.{nl}You can tell Uska I will have all the medical supplies ready for the donation.
I also had time to prepare the blood circulation supplement. Everything is ready to be shipped.
You came to check on how the donation is doing, did you?{nl}
I just talked to headquarters a few days ago.{nl}I'm gonna be in charge of managing the whole fund transfer, you know?{nl}
Everything was sailing smooth, until...{nl}
This piece of cargo got lost somehow on its way to some Alliance executives.{nl}And not just any cargo; Dimensional Stones! You can guess how that went.{nl}
We don't know how it got lost, but now I got to find it and get it delivered ASAP.{nl}So I'd love to help, but you got to give me a hand with this thing first. What do you say?
Alright, I'll hand you the detector.{nl}There ain't much to it. Just go to Grand Yard Mesa and look around with the detector, see if it reacts.{nl}
The Dimensional Stones are going to be inside the sacks buried there, just use the detector and fish them out.{nl}They'll be about 15 Stones in total.{nl}
Don't ask me how a bunch of Dimensional Stones ended up in those sacks. Just get them out.
Get the detector I gave you to Grand Yard Mesa and see if it reacts to any of the sacks there.{nl}I need you to find me the 15 Dimensional Stones.{nl}
I made that detector myself when I was out getting Dimensional Stone samples in Grand Yard Mesa. Worked like a charm, so don't worry.{nl}
I'm afraid there's nothing else I can tell you about what happened to those Dimensional Stones... It's all confidential, you know.
Oh, you got them all out. Good, good.{nl}
Oh, and, um... Let's keep this between you me, hey pal?{nl}I'll make sure to send someone to Uska with the funds today.
You understand why this needs to stay between you and me, right?{nl}Don't worry, I'm sending the funds to Uska in time for the whole thing.
Something nearby is shining.
Oh, you came to check on the donations for the Onmyoji nation.{nl}Yeah, I heard about it from the Master.{nl}
The farmers here are helping us collect grains and cereals, so no issues there... The problem is keeping the food safe.{nl}
Having all these piles of grain around attracts too many bugs.{nl}If it's not too much to ask, would you protect the cereals with some magic?
We store the grain in the Kvie Farm Area. There's around 9 bags of grain there.{nl}The scroll I just gave you is for a spell that keeps the bugs away from the food.{nl}
It's a really useful spell, but there is one downside.{nl}The magic of the scroll isn't that potent, you'll have to apply to the bags of grain one by one.{nl}
Use it only on the bags that are full.{nl}If you go now, you're going to need to apply the spell about 20 times.
There are 9 bags of grain in the Kvie Farm Area.{nl}If you see a bag that's full, use the scroll I gave you to apply the protective magic.{nl}
You're going to need to apply the magic about 20 times for it to work.
Good, you did it!{nl}Uska will be happy to hear we'll have the donations ready in time.
It's all thanks to you, Revelator.{nl}We really appreciate the help.
Is something wrong?
Oh, you only need to pay a visit to the people who are gathering donations for the Onmyoji Master's country and check on their progress.{nl}Don't forget the list I handed you earlier. All the details about the supporters are there.
Ah, glad to hear all the preparations are on schedule.{nl}As it happens, the Onmyoji Master has just arrived in Klaipeda.{nl}You might want to go and have a word with him.
The Onmyoji Master is here in the city of Klaipeda.
Onmyoji Master
You must be the Revelator Mr. Uska spoke to me about.{nl}How nice to finally meet you. My name is Ahiro Seimei, I work in the Kingdom as Onmyoji Master.{nl}
Mr. Uska told me you assisted him in managing the donations. That's very kind of you.{nl}
I have to say, I was worried for the Kingdom after my country began making all those demands.{nl}I'm eternally grateful to Mr. Uska and all our generous supporters.{nl}
The authorities seem content enough with the agreement reached for the donations.{nl}It is a favor I'm looking forward to repay with my service to the Kingdom and its people.{nl}
Do find me again if you're ever interested in knowing more about the Onmyoji.{nl}I'm sure my country won't object, not after all the help you've given us.
Becoming an Onmyoji requires strong concentration and mental power.{nl}These two elements are crucial for anyone looking to commune with the Divine Spirits.{nl}
Many specialists in this field were formally taught in my home country.{nl}Here, too, in the Kingdom, the previous Onmyoji Master founded a special training zone for future Onmyoji students.{nl}
The training zone is located in Sventimas Exile.{nl}Would you like to have a look and begin training there?
Glad to see you again.{nl}The Onmyoji training zone is located in Sventimas Exile. That is where you can begin your instruction.
The board is called a Shikiban. Originally it is used for divination, but this one was developed especially to train new Onmyoji.{nl}If you take it to the training zone in Sventimas Exile, the Shikiban will reveal an area surrounded by a magic barrier.{nl}
Inside the barrier, each of the paper dolls is moving in a certain direction.{nl}Use the Shikiban to control the trajectory of the dolls and cause them to collide with one another.{nl}
Each time you use the Shikiban on a paper doll, its direction will change 90 degrees counterclockwise.{nl}Observe the dolls closely before using the board.
Controlling the paper dolls may not be easy, but you must be willing to persevere.
Congratulations, you are closer to the limits of your potential.{nl}But I beg you. Do not think lightly of the task that is communing with the Divine Spirits.
One's concentration and mental power must, too, be honed in moderation.{nl}You may want to take some time and rest before resuming your training.
The harmony of Yin and Yang was broken on Medzio Diena.{nl}After the disaster, I came to realize once again the great role of the goddesses in maintaining the natural balance.{nl} 
My home country was also very much affected by the aftermath of Medzio Diena, but I believe the answer is here in the Kingdom.{nl}I pray every day that the people and Divine Spirits of my motherland can persist through these dark days.
The true power of the Onmyoji will only manifest itself when Yin and Yang become one.
Fortunately, the mushroom samples you collected were not contaminated.{nl}
Please let Uska know that I'll be delivering the samples myself.{nl}And thank you for all the help.
Fortunately, the grape seed samples you collected were not contaminated.{nl}
In a hidden alley of Fedimian, an old man expired his last breath under Rexipher's deadly grip. The demon threw the man's body on the ground and let out a sigh.{nl}He knew killing a human with his own hands was worth nothing, and that frustrated Rexipher more than anything.{nl} 
Decades had passed since Gesti, his superior, first assigned him the task where he was yet to succeed.{nl}All he had achieved was the daily experience of just how meticulously King Zachariel's mausoleum had been constructed. For years he poured his efforts into infiltrating the mausoleum by force, to no avail. It was only recently that Rexipher had begun to consider other methods.
He had decided to swallow his pride and use the humans.{nl}Zachariel, the owner of the mausoleum, was no longer alive, but he could still target those who helped build it. And so, Rexipher began to wander the Kingdom in search of clues from any human involved in the construction of the mausoleum.{nl}Destiny would have it that even those efforts would be in vain. Nothing had escaped King Zachariel's plans.
 There was a chance it had all been in Laima's prophecy.{nl}As hard as he looked, there wasn't a single document, blueprint or construction plan left in the Kingdom. No human who had worked on the mausoleum had any recollection of it.{nl}All he found was that King Zachariel had hired the most talented wizards of the time to erase their memories through magic not even a demon lord like himself could undo.{nl}
If only he had chased after those humans before the decades had passed, before time took so many of their short lives, there was a slight chance he would have gotten the advantage over Zachariel. Now, Rexipher could do nothing but regret the years spent attempting to force his way into the mausoleum.
During his ventures in the Kingdom, Rexipher often followed groups of thieves and grave robbers, at times adopting a human form to employ them.
That, of course, was as fruitless as any other of his schemes.{nl}King Zachariel's mausoleum had been built to keep out both demons and ordinary thieves alike.{nl}The structure was impossibly sealed and seemed forever inaccessible.
Rexipher found it hard to believe it had been planned by a human at all.{nl}But he wasn't ready to give up. The fear of Gesti's ire and the refusal to be outsmarted by a mortal kept him going.
 He was just about to return to the mausoleum after his trip to Fedimian, where he had gone to gather more information.{nl}He looked around before preparing to teleport to his destination. Teleportation was not unheard of to wizards and other magic users in the Kingdom, but in his human form Rexipher preferred not to call too much attention to himself.{nl}
Then, he noticed someone looking at him; a man was walking in his direction. Oddly, he didn't seem bothered by the body lying motionless at Rexipher's feet.{nl}He stopped in front of the demon and greeted him courteously. [Pleased to meet you.]{nl}Rexipher noticed the man hadn't used the typical human 'Hello' and wondered whether there was more to him than what his common appearance let on. He skipped the introductions. [You know a lot for a human, don't you?]
The man replied.{nl}[My name is Rirumras Jonas. Our Great King committed to my family an official order regarding individuals – human or otherwise – such as yourself. I am here to honor His Majesty's royal order.]{nl}Taken aback by the man's response, Rexipher couldn't help but ask.{nl}[What are you talking about?]
[The King invested great efforts to ensure that his eternal mausoleum would remain secure without the need for a keeper. As far as we know, the mausoleum contains an object that will be extremely important in the future. No one knows when it will be needed: it could be in a thousand, even two thousand years.{nl}Because of this, the mausoleum's facilities were designed to remain dormant until the time when that important object becomes necessary.{nl}Therefore, one would be required to wait until the mausoleum becomes accessible. Of course, some devices in the mausoleum can be activated from the outside, but they cannot be shut down again.
Not only that, most members of the court have no knowledge of how to operate said devices. Only a few select families and individuals keep partial information on the system.]{nl}[Why are you telling me this?]
[First, I want to confirm whether you are the kind of person we are required to watch.]{nl}Rexipher replied. [So you want to know if I'm one of those so-called demons.]{nl}[Correct.][I am. I won't try and deny it. Now that it's confirmed, what are you going to do about it?]
[My family is responsible for activating certain devices in the mausoleum in the event of an attempted breach, not only by human thieves but especially by a demon such as yourself.{nl}After the devices are activated, the mausoleum will generate a stronger defensive response to demon trespassers.]{nl}[Stronger than what it already is?]{nl}[There's always the chance that the structure may deteriorate with time, but yes.]{nl}[What if I were to kill you here and now?]
[I was fully aware of that possibility when I made the decision to approach you.{nl}Alas, my family will activate the devices even if I am to die. They will withhold action if – and only if – I return to tell them that you were neither a demon, nor a human under demon influence. It is not a question of whether I am alive or not.{nl}I should also warn you that my family will not be deceived by any demon attempting to impersonate me.]{nl}[Of course. Zachariel really did his homework, didn't he?]
{nl}Rexipher and the Royal Mausoleum Vol.2
Jonas continued. [I don't know how long my family may survive, but we and everyone affiliated with us carries their own designated mission. Some of us do what I am doing, some of us keep records, and so on.{nl}However, even if our families become extinct or can no longer serve under His Majesty's command, the mausoleum was designed to resist transgressions for many eras to come.{nl}All we are doing is helping maintain the mausoleum's security in any way we can. You see, the King prepared the mausoleum to withstand a thousand years, but he also made provisions for the event that it was required to remain closed for longer. I, for one, am quite pleased that we're able to fulfill one of our missions in such a short time after the completion of the mausoleum.]
Rexipher followed. [Can I ask you something?]{nl}[Yes, what is it?]{nl}[Why did you come here to tell me that? When you could have confirmed that I was a demon otherwise and activated the mausoleum without saying a word to me.]{nl}[Allow me to explain. You see, there is something I must let you know.]
With that, Jonas pulled out a small piece of paper and offered it to Rexipher.{nl}[Read this. It tells you that His Majesty left deliberate clues around the plateau near the mausoleum. The clues will tell you what you need to know if you're looking to approach the mausoleum.]{nl}The demon focused on the small memo. Jonas continued.
[What do you say? As you can see from these notes, there's a slight chance that the mausoleum can be unlocked. How about you go back and resume what you were doing?]{nl}[What sort of trick is this? Doesn't this put you at a disadvantage? Why would you try and please me?]
Jonas replied. [It's very simple, from what I was told. You, as a demon, have the ability to hold onto the mausoleum for many, many eras to come. That alone will prove to be very meaningful at a future time, though we don't know why or how. Perhaps your powers will be used for a just purpose. In any case, this is a decision you will find hard to avoid.]{nl}It was true. Rexipher had no choice but to follow through with Gesti's orders. He couldn't bear admit to a fellow demon that he had failed to force his way into the tomb of a mere human.{nl}All he could do now was pursue the fate Laima had set out, perpetuated in the actions of the man in front of him and his peers. Rexipher knew this was not Jonas' vision. It had all been planned decades before by Laima Herself and King Zachariel.
Determined to win at any cost, the demon spared his words. Jonas had already told him all he needed to know. Rexipher quietly took the man's life and disappeared.{nl}The mystery that lied before him would not be deciphered for another millennium but, for now, Rexipher remained unaware of the tremendous hardship that was to come.

* Hayraven's Unofficial Chronicles Part 1
The Great Pirate Vladislovas.{nl}With each step, in the shadow of his footsteps remained the blood of his defeated enemies. Demons bowed their heads and drew away in his presence. In front of the ruthless Vladislovas stood a much younger Hayraven.{nl}From the splashing waves to the rocking boats, all became silent. Even the seagulls soaring up high had quieted down to watch them.{nl}There was no prize for the winner of this battle; the fight was for the title of Great Pirate.{nl}Hayraven drew his cutlass and began by attacking Vladislovas in swift steps, aiming once for his chest, twice for each side of his torso.
But his attacks were too obvious for Vladislovas.{nl}Grabbing ahold of Hayraven's cutlass, he kicked him in the pit of his stomach, knocking him over.{nl}Then, as if to teach the younger pirate a lesson, he hit Hayraven with the hilt of his sword again and again.
Hayraven barely escaped the cruel pirate's attack to regain his footing.{nl}He was already injured, and Vladislovas looked set for victory. Hayraven swallowed once.
If he were to surrender, the brutal but skillful Vladislovas may take him as his subordinate. This likely had crossed Vladislovas' mind, seeing how he had chosen to spare Hayraven's life until then.{nl}But Hayraven shook away the thought. He began to collect himself as he shot his opponent a hidden smirk.
Again, he charged unto Vladislovas, stubbornly delivering the same attacks he knew were in vain.{nl}Vladislovas grew bored of toying with the young Hayraven. It would be the sharpened blade instead of the hilt striking at his throat next.
Then, Hayraven suddenly turned, drew a pistol out from its holster and pulled the trigger. The bullet lodged itself precisely in the middle of Vladislovas' forehead and his large body slowly collapsed towards Hayraven.{nl}
 The small boat, no longer able to withstand the weight of both Vladislovas and Hayraven, tilted over.
Waves splashed against the hull, and the cries of seagulls began to fill the air again.{nl}Nobody came to the surface. And the waves swept away the name of the Great Pirate.{nl}Far away from where the sea swallowed the small boat and the two pirates was a large ship.
In it, two groups of men had divided themselves between bow and stern; each busy setting up camp on their end of the boat.{nl}The men avoided looking directly at the opposite side as they worked. Their eyes were locked in another direction: the direction in which the captain of each group had departed on a small boat long before.{nl}
The ship where they stood was the last one remaining of a battle that went on for two entire days. Now, the men had been forced into a silent confrontation.
One side owned the ship; the other lost theirs, and had come aboard to continue the battle hand-to-hand.{nl}If their pact was to be honored, both sides would soon become the crew of that very ship, regardless of who had first served in it.
All had agreed that he who survived and returned to the ship would be made captain, be it Vladislovas or Hayraven. No pirate dared to defy Vladislovas, but if the young Hayraven was to kill him, the same would be true for him.
Bored of the stagnant tension, one man from Vladislovas' crew that occupied the stern of the ship decided to break the silence.{nl}It was Seadog, the 2nd navigator with a large dog tattoo drawn across his broad chest.
#N/A
Seadog did not hesitate.{nl}[I swear on the name of Jurate, that whoever attacks the other side before we arrive in Vernike Island will forever turn into ballast for the Kivotos.]{nl}Oceanid repeated Seadog's oath, followed by the men on either side of the ship.
Seadog took a glance at the sky and spoke again. [We'd better pray for a storm in the meantime. Though, with this weather...] Oceanid, a veteran of the sea himself, agreed with Seadog, though he too thought a storm to be unlikely.
[With the men we have, I don't think we can work this ship under a storm anyway. We'll barely make it to Vernike with all crew and any good weather Jurate can bless us with. We couldn't fight even if we wanted to.]
So it was.{nl}They weren't waiting for the result of the fights between their captains because they are loyal pirates.{nl}It seems like that they left for the battle to claim the title of the Great Pirate, the captain of remaining ship and crews. But it wasn't.
Mens of two crews could just heave up anchor and leave without their or opponent's captain upon one agreement.{nl}And that is their usual behavior. But the battle of the last two days had been that violent and intense.
They no longer wished to fight over whom to name their captain.{nl}If they did, they certainly knew that nothing was to be gained from that.{nl}He who returned to the ship would be made captain, be it Vladislovas or Hayraven.
If neither did, the crew would leave the waters, and a new struggle for power would surely ensue. After the ship reached Vernike or another suitable port, that is. They would first ensure that the ship could sail with half of the remaining crew, or perhaps even half of that.
#N/A
Seadog and Oceanid had fallen silent.
{nl}They stared into the horizon, avoiding each other's unpleasant gaze.{nl}Any words like
What are you looking at
could ruin everything.
The both of them wise enough not to start another conflict was a fortunate thing.{nl}It was in that moment that they heard the sound of someone climbing up the rope ladder that hung from the side of the ship.
{nl}The sparse crew meant that no one had been assigned to the lookout atop of the mast. The only way to look was to lean down from the edge of the ship, an act too risky for any of the men on board to pursue.
They had not heard the small boat approach the ship, so whoever it was who was climbing that rope ladder, he would have had to swim his way back.
The small boat was far too distant for that to seem plausible, but it was even less likely that someone else had happened to approach the ship in those waters.{nl}The men on deck focused on the sounds of the climbing stranger, until a hand emerged and gripped the edge of the gunwale.
The hand was not familiar to them, perhaps form all the blood, sun and sea that washed over it on the long way to the ship.{nl}No one offered to help.
If, by any chance, that hand belonged to the rival captain, they did not want his crew to misunderstand it as an attempted attack.
Seadog and Oceanid remained silent, focusing their attention on the edge of the ship while signaling their crews to stay still.{nl}The hand gripping the gunwale trembled as it pulled up the heavy body of the stranger, revealing his face.
Nearly unrecognizable by his subordinates were Hayraven's features, mangled by multiple wounds and sheer exhaustion.{nl}Every pirate on the ship thanked Jurate for giving them the victor they so eagerly awaited.
Hayraven climbed over the gunwale and stood on the deck, looking at the men on each side of the ship before addressing them.{nl}[I grant you all permission to board my ship.]
He spoke as if he had been alone on the ship waiting for the others to board.{nl}That may not have been the case, but to sailors of all kinds, boarding permission was an important convention.{nl}It was also a sign that all of the crews' problems had been solved, as no man had any intentions to defy his authority.{nl}Knowing this, Hayraven spoke again.{nl}[The captain's cabin...]
Hayraven collapsed onto the deck before he could finish his sentence, and the pirates around him hurried to help.{nl}Old and new members of his crew laid the unconscious Hayraven down in the captain's cabin.
Hayraven's Unofficial Chronicles Part 2
Warm sunlight was shining through the window of the captain's cabin. Hayraven, opening his eyes, awoke from his shallow sleep. He had dreamt another of his many recurring dreams.{nl}At times finding himself on a small boat, facing an unfamiliar foe, or at others recalling events from his past. He would dream of endless rope ladders and ghost ships. Visions of his crew and Vladislovas' subordinates populated his subconscious; dreams that shifted but remained unchanged as well.{nl}
He put on his clothes and stepped out onto the deck, where he was greeted by his crew. Hayraven raised his hand in response as he walked, but was halted by the sight of Seadog approaching. 
The latter looked up at the watchman stationed atop of the mast.{nl}Before Seadog could speak, the watchman cried out,{nl}[Mast sighted starboard!]{nl}Unaware of the fact that he would have been punished had his warning arrived only a second later, the watchman continued to shout.
[Merchant vessel! Flag unidentified!]{nl}He soon followed with more information.{nl}[Flag confirmed! It's a Kedora Alliance vessel!]{nl}Hayraven nodded at Seadog, who understood his orders.
The captain, having spotted the approaching vessel long before the watchman, sat down on a deckchair and quietly observed his crew prepare for battle under Seadog's command. The merchant ship was now close enough for all the men on board to see. Seadog, who was standing next to the captain, muttered in surprise,{nl}[Huh. Who do we have here?]
Hayraven's eyes were also set on the group of heavily armed men on deck of the neighboring vessel.{nl}[Looks like Guerra's Pledge of the Blade mercenaries are on board.]{nl}Seadog spoke carefully.
[They don't seem to be shipping any cargo. If all they have are mercenaries, their ship will be light and fast. Seems to me like they should be counting on that to retreat as fast as they can now... Unlike the Golden Note mercenaries, they don't look like they travel with enough combat supplies, either.]
[Running away would taint their reputation; that can't be good for business. No, they're looking for a fight here. Let's grant their wish,] Hayraven concluded. [Do you reckon Guerra's involved?]{nl}[It doesn't look like he is, Captain.]{nl}Seadog shot another glance at the watchman, confirming the absence of any new reports. Hayraven spoke again.{nl}[Look at the way they're lined up. They're expecting hand-to-hand. They think I'm going to fight them their way, do they?]
[The Pledge of the Blade is known for the knives, but they should know their arrows, too.]{nl}Hayraven took Seadog's words lightly.{nl}[We're pirates; we start our fights from the ship, and if we can, we end them from the ship. Why let it escalate? It's not like we're fighting the Great Pirate Vladislovas now, is it?"{nl}Seadog acquiesced and began calling out the captain's orders to the crew in a sonorous voice.
Hayraven returned to his deckchair. The early stages of the battle were easy for Hayraven's side. The wind blew in the direction of the enemy, protecting his ship from the merchant vessel's arrows and allowing his crew to decimate a large part of the mercenary forces.
Yet, no strangers to the projectile attack themselves, the Pledge of the Blade used wide shields to defend their crews.{nl}However, they were at sea.{nl}If anyone had the knowledge to make the most of the factors at play, it was hayraven.
By controlling the movement of his own ship from its fortunate position, he made use of the wind and currents to tilt the enemy vessel to a nearly 45 degrees angle.{nl}
Not only were they now standing on a slope, the mercenaries had to maintain their balance over the continuous rocking of the waves, which to less seasoned sailors was no easy task.{nl}Once the Pledge's numbers were sufficiently reduced, hand-on-hand combat began.{nl}Seadog coarsely shouted the order at the pirates.{nl}[Hook them! Hook the Ship!]
Hayraven's subordinates hurried to swing their hooks into the enemy vessel. The mercenaries, in turn, bustled to and fro, cutting off the ropes attached to the priates' metal hooks using large two-handed swords.
Observing the mercenaries' fast response to his attack, Hayraven stood up from the deckchair.{nl}[They aren't playing, are they?]{nl}He ran to the edge of the ship and swung his own iron hook at the merchant vessel, striking an unknown mercenary across the chest. The hook went on to bury itself deep within the ship.
Another member of the Pledge ran towards Hayraven's hook brandishing his bayonet. Seeing him,{nl}the captain withdrew his pistol and aimed.{nl}One shot was all it took to blast away the mercenary.
Yet already another one was attempting to reach the hook. This time, the mercenary avoided the pistol shot, causing Hayraven to react with a smile of amusement.{nl}[Alright, this one knows what he's doing. Let's see you cut this, then!] As he spoke, Hayraven swung another hook at the enemy ship, one which the agile mercenary was unable to avoid.
Struggling to free himself from the hook, the man bore deep injuries as Hayraven pulled him through the waters between the two vessels.
The Keel hauling eventually took his life before the captain could pull him up onto the pirate ship.{nl}The two crafts drew closer and closer, and hayraven eagerly reached for the Jolly Roger.
[Did Vladislovas ever hit a hip with the Jolly Roger from this far?] he asked, grinning blithely.{nl}Seadog, who had been standing by the captain awaiting new orders, shook his head.{nl}[At this distance? Impossible.]
Hayraven replied.{nl}[That's right. For anyone else it is.]{nl}With this, he launched the pirate flag across the waters.Seeing the Jolly Roger lodge itself in the merchant ship, Hayraven called out to his crew.
[Go! Let them fear my flag! I'm giving twice the loot to the first pirate to slaughter a mercenary by the Jolly Roger!]{nl}Seadog followed with his own commands.{nl}[You heard the captain. The last man to get on that ship is riding the keel.]
The pirates dutifully complied, echoing each other's battle cries as they crossed over onto the merchant ship.{nl}The Pledge of the Blade were already behind their opponents in both number and morale, and having Hayraven himself join the combat only asserted their inevitable defeat.
The Pirate Captain's dust devil quickly spread terror among the last surviving members of the mercenary group, who promptly abandoned their weapons and surrendered.{nl}It wasn't long before Hayraven's subordinates executed the few who had dared to resist them.
Finally, the captain and crew of the merchant ship, who had been hiding in a corner of the vessel as the battle was held, were dragged out onto the deck.{nl}These sailors had been spared by the mere efficiency of Hayraven's powerful attacks.{nl}Had the conflict spread out across the entire ship, they were unlikely to have survived.
The pirate looked down at the captured crew before addressing them.{nl}[Are these all the men you have? I didn't think there'd be so few of you.]{nl}Their captain replied.{nl}[It is as Guerra requested, yes. The Alliance crew was reduced and the work was assigned to his mercenaries to decrease costs.
Not only was the ship mostly occupied by these mercenaries, we are also carrying a considerable amount of our own cargo. It was very difficult for us to sail in these conditions, you see. Guerra's men aren't familiar with the sea; I suppose that ultimately led to their defeat today.]
[According to your logs, the goods you're shipping are heavy but they aren't worth much. And you say you cut the freight charges, too. It sure doesn't sound like a good deal for the alliance.]{nl}[Before our encounter, Captain, the mercenaries were paying their passage as stipulated in the contract, tending to the weapons and cleaning the deck. As for the goods, they may not be worth much now, but surely you're aware of how we do business at the Kedora Merchant Alliance. The original value of those goods will pose no problem. That is why...]
The captain of the merchant vessel stood up to adopt a bolder stance.{nl}[Should you release this ship, the crew and all of our merchandise in safety, I propose to write you a certificate. A document that guarantees you a generous fee from any branch of the Kedora Alliance.
Our goods won't yield much profit to an untrained merchant. And as you see, our current personnel are far too scarce to be any help to you. Our only condition is that this ship arrives safely at its destination. Once that is confirmed, you're welcome to claim your reward.]
[So you're offering me a paper that's worth more than this ship, the cargo and a few crewmen. Is that right? And all I have to do is wait for you to dock and tell the Alliance to get my money?]{nl}[That is correct. I should say, our communication network is rather advanced; it won't take long for the information to reach all our branches.'
Hayraven pondered for a moment.{nl}[Alright. The Alliance always finds a way to avoid a loss, don't they? Dirtier than pirates, you are. Then, the rest of the filthy mercenaries will stay with us, yes? Everything they had on them, too.]
The captain of the Kedora Alliance knew Hayraven was not asking for consent, and so he nodded in agreement.{nl}The surviving mercenaries and their belongings were moved to the pirate ship.
Oceanid approached Hayraven and asked,{nl}[Should we get the plank ready?]{nl}It was the custom in pirate ships to force captured enemies onto a plank laid on the side of the vessel and demand that they choose between joining the crew and drowning at sea.
Hayraven, however, shook his head.{nl}[Leave them be. I have a deal with Olfas Grimm. We'll gather a few more prisoners and sell them off to the Monk Master. Let them starve until they're weak enough, but not so much that they'll mutiny.]
The captain's orders were confusing, but Oceanid acceded and returned to the crew.
Hayraven was left to mutter to himself.{nl}[Guerra, you filthy rat. I hope you find me after this; maybe then I'll finally get myself a worthy fight.
This time we’ll use our knives. Hmm. Come to think of it, they do say Creak is a match for Guerra. Who knows, it could be fun to fight Creak, too. Bore a bullet hole in his skull like I did to Vladislovas. He’s not bad with his gun either, or so they say.]
At the end of his train of thought, Hayraven became silent. He raised his eyes to the silhouette of the merchant ship slowly disappearing in the horizon before turning back to the captain's cabin.
Golden Note - War Journal Vol.1
* Golden Note - War Journal Vol.1
Warsis Creek, Schwarzer Reiter Master and leader of the Golden Note mercenaries, was tending to his weapon in the barracks when the voice of a subordinate called his attention.{nl}[You have a guest.]{nl}[Let them in.]{nl}His partner Paul's features were akin to those of a large gorilla, though his wit was anything but dim.
The fact that he had chosen not to deal with the client's request himself meant that there was a problem.{nl}An issue with the contract, perhaps. Or a client too important not to be seen directly by him...
{nl}[Our guest has just arrived from the Polanyi territories.]{nl}[Pleased to meet you. My name is Yiltren, representative of the Polanyi territories.]{nl}Warsis stood up to greet him. Yiltrin returned the formal bow and prepared to address the Master.
Warsis figured that being forced to repeat what he had likely just told Paul all over again would at least bother him, but the man's expression remained calm and composed. Either his problem was urgent, or he was used to that kind of situation. His posture gave away no signs of restlessness, so Warsis concluded it was the latter.
[The former Duke of Polanyi divided the territories into three portions, which he passed on to each of his sons. Our land is now smaller and no longer united, but the three lords have always lived in relative harmony.
That is, until recently, when the eldest brother passed away with no heir of his own, and the land was once again divided. Each lord now owns part of their brother's land, but neither can agree on how to share it. It has gotten to the point where they're resorting to the use of force.]
The dispute itself was obvious to Warsis, but he was left wondering.{nl}[I understand that they would resist dividing the land in half out of greed, but any official diplomat of the Kingdom can certainly intervene. How did the situation escalate without the say of the government?]
[Official powers do intervene when there is a dispute between two noble families. The ministry will send officers to investigate and determine who is right, then take the measures necessary to enforce their decision. Unfortunately that is not the protocol for conflicts arising within nobles of the same family.
The ministry will not interfere unless a member of the family is suspected of a very grave crime, such as practicing cruel tyranny against the people of their land, colluding with the demons, or otherwise violating the sanctity of the goddess' divine grace.
As it is, matters concerning the sovereignty of a territory are the sole responsibility of the ruling lord or lords.]{nl}[Even if that's true, I do think an official diplomat should be able to issue a corrective order...]
[Well, yes, but it would take a serious infraction of the royal law in order for them to take any measures. There's never been a corrective order issued about territorial disputes. In fact, there's hardly ever been a situation considered grave enough to warrant a corrective order.
It simply cannot be done without a serious motive.]{nl}[I suppose they never punished any lords for misjudging their own governing abilities or famishing entire regions...]{nl}[Precisely. Incompetence does not justify the punishment of someone in the noble class. When the people disagree with their lord's decisions, they find a cleric to complain to, or they petition to the ministry in the capital. Otherwise, they simply live at the whims of their ruler, for better or for worse.]
[So your case is considered an internal issue and can't be solved through diplomatic action.]{nl}[Not only that, but since there is no heir, the residents prefer that one of the former Duke's remaining sons is made lord, rather than an administrative officer from the capital.
As you know, if a lord passes with no legitimate heir or has their noble title revoked as punishment, an officer of the Kingdom is assigned to manage the territory.{nl}That opens the possibility for another noble person to gain ownership of the land.
In any case, an administrative officer, as fair and benevolent as they may be, will only stay as long as their mandate. There is no telling what influence that might have on the region.
A long-term ruler is the better option, particularly considering that our former Duke is still very much revered by his people.]{nl}[Well, any lord can only rule because there is the law of the Kingdom above them. And with it, clerics that commune with the goddesses and interpret Their will.
The only difference, which you also mention, is that a lord can rule the same territory for longer. That is what keeps local government stable and consistent. I wouldn't say it's because lords are more competent than royal officers.]
[I very much agree. Our problem is that the land was divided in three not long after it was first united. The residents agree on a reunification, but the ministry has left the issue in the hands of the current rulers.]
[In all honesty, you should be thankful that they've given you power over this situation. So, are the two lords preparing for battle?]{nl}[No, sir. That is not what they want. But settling this dispute through words alone has proven impossible, which is why I came to request your help. Isn't this the kind of work you do, after all?]
[Hm, I see. They can't use their own people for battle. Any casualties and the royal officers will come knocking. Talking it out isn't going to work either, so they're looking to hire mercenaries to fight for them instead.
If that's all there is, was there a need to bring the client to me directly instead of accepting the order and reporting on it as usual? Paul?]{nl}The words were harsh in Paul's ears, but Warsis was used to relegating general requests to his partner and did not hesitate to scold him.
Paul's answer was simple.{nl}[The other side is employing the Pledge of the Blade, sir.]{nl}[Hah. So you thought I'd be scared of facing Guerra? Or do you just take pleasure in hearing a client say it to my face?
Doesn't matter. It's not every day you get the chance to stand against an expert like Guerra. We'll take the request. You can settle the details of the contract with my partner Paul.]{nl}Warsis directed a short bow towards their client, before turning around with a pleased smile.{nl}[This is going to be interesting.]
Golden Note - War Journal Vol. 2
* Golden Note - War Journal Vol. 2
[This is not your call, General!]{nl}Schwarzer Reiter Master Warsis Creek raised his voice to the man facing him across the table. They were inside his barracks, sitting opposite each other on worn out wooden stools.{nl}[I'm afraid it is.]
The reply came from Lamin, a general of the Royal Army.{nl}[How?? Territorial disputes are under the jurisdiction of the ministry. Their officer Beikeol already declared that the problem is to be settled by the two parties, in consideration of the residents and the former Duke.
I'm well aware of the conditions. No damage to any property in the region, and no casualties on either side of the local armed forces.
So I have to insist: this is not the place for the Royal Army. Think about it. Your superiors won't be happy to hear you're interfering in a civilian dispute; that will only escalate the problem. Not to mention how it will look to His Majesty the King.]
[We have no intentions of defying the authority of royal officers or ministries. The same is true for the Royal Guard, our Royal Knights, and every other general of the Kingdom.]{nl}[Why is it that having you, General, say this in front of me only makes you sound less credible?]
[My men and I are officially off duty. In the meantime, we were given orders to search for territories around the Kingdom that can be used for military purposes.
This area of land has just lost its owner and it could be very useful to us. Naturally, we want it.{nl}Whether the ruling lords are at battle, or whether they hire mercenaries to fight for them is not of our concern.{nl}Territorial disputes aside, we are here to adapt this region for military use. That is our official stance.]{nl}Warsis Creek pondered on the general's words before replying.
[That's the army's position. Now I want to hear your personal opinion, General Lhamin.]{nl}[Yes, to be honest, if it weren't for this dispute we wouldn't have come here under the pretext of using this land for the army.]{nl}Lhamin paused for a moment before speaking again.{nl}[Mr. Creek.]
Intrigued to hear the general call out his name, the Schwarzer Reiter Master adjusted his position, leaning lower towards the table.{nl}Lhamin waited until he was sure he had Warsis' undivided attention.
[I'll be frank with you. I know I'm overstepping my authority coming here. I know I have no right to stand in the way of official orders, but I was not sent here by my superiors. I'm keeping an eye on Olfas Grimm and Aleister Crowley. I'm also worried that something might provoke the folks in the Astral Tower to launch an attack.
Those are all real threats to the safety of the Kingdom.{nl}But the Royal Army isn't allowed to take action without sufficient reason. And we can't give away the fact that we're paying attention to these issues. Only when something happens can we intervene.]
[Well, isn't it your duty as general of the Royal Army? Following the orders of your superiors and the Royal Court when trouble happens?]{nl}[Need I remind you that you abandoned a bright career as general of the Kingdom to pursue your own military endeavors, Mr. Creek? If anyone should sympathize with my position, I would expect that to be you.]
[So you believe that waiting until the Court commands you to act is more damaging to the Kingdom, and you can't stand waiting in the dark. So you'll do whatever it takes to prevent something serious from happening, as long as it's not strictly against royal law.]
[Correct. I believe it's my duty as general of the Kingdom to use any resources at my disposal to protect the nation and its people.]{nl}[Good. I agree with you, General. Although I don't think I would describe my military career as "bright". Yours, on the other hand...]
[I'm afraid there are many talented and more experienced generals above me, Mr. Creek.]{nl}[Come on, General, there's no need to be humble. Tell me what you want.]
[Ministry officer Beikeol is a very intelligent man and an outstanding bureaucrat. Some even say he's set to become the next Premier Eminent.
But something about his behavior changed in the past few years. It's not enough to incriminate him, but it has caught my attention. Like this territorial dispute, for example. The locals who remember the original Duke want their land to be ruled by either one of his remaining sons.
The officer agreed to let the two lords settle things on their own, so long as the conflict doesn't escalate too far. This all seems fairly reasonable, until you consider...]{nl}[... that the scale of this whole confrontation wouldn't be nearly as serious if the lords hadn't hired the Pledge of the Blade and the Golden Note to fight in their behalf. Regardless of the outcome, the responsibility is ours and the residents'.
Do you think the officer was trying to aggravate the conflict? There's no proof of it, of course, but is that your suspicion?]{nl}[Incisive as always, Mr. Creek. Not only is there no proof of the officer's intentions, but his reasoning is almost undeniably correct.
Also, I suspect it may have something to do with the fact that two Class Masters and two rival mercenary groups are involved.]{nl}[I can see why. Now, this isn't entirely related, but I'm curious about your work with the Astral Tower and the other Masters. I understand you're paying close attention to them.]
[As a Master yourself, you know that Class Masters are treated like nobility even if they aren't of the noble class. After all, it's an important position one gains by having their talent recognized. The problem is when one of those highly talented people uses their skill or authority for personal reasons.
I simply think that Masters who show that disposition should be monitored.]{nl}[There are much more despicable people among our Class Masters. Corsair Master Hayraven, for example.]{nl}[It was His Majesty, King Rowmel who assigned high positions to pirate captains of the time to increase the numbers of the Royal Navy, and gave them the symbolic token that is passed on from Master to Master. It was an unfortunate decision that we should be trying to rectify.
It isn't right for us to continue allowing the pirates to use their contributions of eight centuries ago as an excuse to maintain their importance and appoint their own Masters.]{nl}[Revoking their right to the royal token is nearly impossible now.
The token was always taken from the previous Master through means of skill, and His Majesty, King Kadumel declared 600 years ago that the position of Class Master is to be merited by skill. No king has been able to invalidate the token after that, and now it's in Hayraven's hands.
Whether we like it or not, the token proves that he is recognized by the Kingdom.]{nl}[King Kadumel's legacy isn't the brightest, unfortunately.]{nl}[Any reasonable person will agree, but that's not what we need to focus on.]{nl}[How I regret not being able to handle Hayraven myself.]
[And you say you're worried about the Astral Tower? That's unexpected. The Schaffenstar have been strong allies of the Kingdom for centuries, and Mechen doesn't seem all that bad.]{nl}[Yes, I very much admire their long tradition and dedication. Their leader Mcen is also exceptionally talented and good-natured.
 However, the Schaffenstar are more numerous than ever and they're incredibly skilled. Not only that, they have autonomous rights. They may follow the values of their founder Lydia Schaffen now, but there's no guarantee that that will always be the case.
From a military point of view, if the Schaffenstar were to declare themselves as an independent territory with the Starlit Lake as their borders, there is little the Kingdom could do about it. "There is no such thing as an impenetrable fortress, and even the strongest ones are destined to fail without consistent support from the outside"...]
[Glkahn Donihue, The Theory of War Vol. 3.]{nl}Lamin looked almost serene as he nodded knowingly at Warsis. The general continued.
[Unlike what the great General Donihue believed, however, impenetrable fortresses do exist. The Astral Tower is proof of that. It transcends theory, really. The only possible way to conquer it would be to wait for all the Schaffenstar members to grow too old to sustain the tower.
Not even if a miracle of the goddesses brought back all the great generals of King Zachariel would there be another way to bring it down by force.]
[The way I see it, all it takes is an act of treason to weaken the entire foundation of a society like them.]{nl}[Yes, historically it wouldn't be the first time it has happened. The problem is that there isn't much else we can hope for in terms of a solution. As general of the Royal Army, I simply cannot be at ease knowing that an organization like this has the power to ignore our royal laws if they want to.]
[I understand, but let's not worry about things that haven't happened yet. We have our own problem to solve now, remember? What are you going to do about our dispute?]{nl}[From what I've observed, it seems like both you and Mr. Guerra aren't quite sure about what to do next.
You already settled your commission with the lords. Financially, you can't afford to drag the dispute for much longer. You fought a few battles with no sure victory, but scaling up the conflict means an even heavier burden on your funds.
Maybe it isn't my place to say this to the leader of a mercenary group, but if you've been fighting for this long with nothing but casualties and injuries to compensate for, isn't it time to agree on a cease-fire? Isn't that also part of your work?]
[I do not need you to explain my job to me. I understand very well that this situation needs to end if we're going make a profit from it. Guerra isn't the only one with an eye for money. Do you think I would be the leader of a mercenary group if I didn't know how to do business?]
[Very well. My request is simple, then. Leave. I know you need to return to the capital soon, to complete your contract with the arena and take in new men from their group of fighters. Surely you're not planning to miss that? You would be wasting the amount you spent on the deposit, not to mention the opportunity to integrate new mercenaries.
It's very important that you leave now. You may lose the bonus for retreating without a victory, but I'm sure you'll have agreed on a fair commission either way. And yes, you can count on extra compensation if you stay and win, but if your side is defeated, won't that result in twice the losses?
 That is why you need to leave now. Take the path of less risk and abandon this conflict immediately.]{nl}[Financially, yes, that is the most sensible solution. But still...]{nl}[My soldiers and I will occupy the entire area where your mercenaries are located.  The Pledge of the Blade won't be able to attack us.
 It's hard to imagine anyone defying the Royal Army. In fact, my soldiers and I would be happy if they tried. We would very much like the chance to face off against Guerra's men. It isn't something that happens every day, after all.]
[Would that be legally viable?]{nl}[We'll use force and pressure them to abandon their occupied territory. The ministry or the army will likely send someone to investigate. They'll go back and forth before they make the decision to send me the orders to retreat, but that will take time.
I'll receive a warning for misinterpreting the scope of my duty; nothing serious. If I'm lucky, my superior in the capital, General Vincentas, might even recognize this land for official military use.
 If that happens, the two lords who hired you will just have to accept the situation. Of course, with the ministry in charge, things might not look good for me.
Prince Tylenis and Princess Kaonilla both have ties with some of my general friends in the Royal Army, so I don't believe they would let me get demoted over this incident. At most, I'm expecting a cut in my pay or some other kind of mild disciplinary action.]
[If you're already expecting that, why not go ahead and propose an expropriation of the disputed territory? Even if one of the lords ends up occupying the land, the profit from the crops can help fund the soldiers stationed in the area. It can't get more practical than that.]
[That's a good idea. We would never be able to do that in reality, but the absurd proposal is sure to make the two lords rethink their positions. If we can create a new plan to section the land, there's a chance they will consider it one final time.]
[I think Guerra should handle the agreement, in that case. I will already be gone by then, and Guerra can use his influence to settle the dispute and receive some added compensation from both lords.]
[Are you sure you're rivals? Hahah. That's incredibly generous of you, Mr. Creek.]{nl}[Let's keep it at that. I'll give my men orders to begin evacuating. But I'll need to you to make sure that both my mercenaries and the local soldiers are protected from Guerra's side while I'm away.]
[That's a given, isn't it? I already gave you my word as general of the Kingdom.]{nl}[I wouldn't have let you convince me this far if I didn't trust you, General.]{nl}[Thank you, Mr. Creek.]{nl}[Thank you for the meeting.]{nl}Pleased, the men stood up from their stools and shook hands over the table.

The Origin of Nicopolis{nl}- Year 1096 of the Kingdom,{nl}Sage Master Lufas Kehel{nl}
The year 15 of the reign of King Baltinel, the 14th King, was a time where the vigor of the founding of the Kingdom was weak and conflicts between factions reached their peak.{nl}This was during the years 348 and 363, about 700 years ago.{nl}Although he was unable to settle the conflict, he is known for laying down the foundation for the Royal army.{nl}If one considers that the rules of King Jeromel's time kept the Kingdom in order, then one could also agree that King Baltinel's use of the Royal Army was another, equal approach to the problems.{nl}This new military approach was helpful in solving the issues of King Baltinel and of his predecessors.{nl}Yet during the reign of King Jusel, after the conflicts between political factions had been settled, a new approach was needed for dealing with the other problems that still remained.{nl}
 Of these, the most serious issue to deal with was the Wizards.{nl}During this time, the Wizards had organized themselves into an alliance and compelled others to join.{nl}
 Joining the union also meant following a strict set of rules. As a result, the Wizard society of this time was divided into union members and non-union members.{nl}And if compared, those of the union were stronger than those who were not.{nl}
 There were worries that the the Clerics and other warriors who bore the strength of the goddesses would be overpowered or, if that was not the case, the union Wizards would overtake the country.{nl}If the organized Wizards were simply stronger and nothing more, then these rumors would not spread, but there were a small few within the union who clearly wished to use this strength for power.{nl}
 On the other hand, there were Wizards who are either hermits or research-focused and act alone, separate from the union.{nl}As such, although those of the union did not seek for world domination, most of the Wizard societies' initiatives and proposals naturally went in favor of the union.{nl} 
 Concerns were raised about what would happen to the Wizard society if the union was left unattended.{nl}Although the concerns were few, it was those with wisdom who brought the issue before the Kingdom, thus marking it as a crisis.{nl}
 Thus began King Jusel's official support of non-union Wizards.{nl}Through official policies, his government provided financial support for their research and livelihood.{nl}In retaliation, union Wizards sold their magic at a more expensive price, making it harder for mercenaries and others to gather funds.{nl}
 Yet those who were not part of the union were mostly researchers and hermits, while those who were part of the union more actively and systematically sold their products to the noble families. This allowed them to build a wider circle of connections.{nl}As such, King Jusel could not prevent the contracts and transactions that occurred between his Kingdom's subjects.{nl}
 However, there were more complicated measures, such as adding a new tax regulation to cut into the union's profits and to move the non-union members into friendlier relationships with the royal family while slowly reducing the amount of union shops.{nl}Through these methods the government and the nobles were forced to invite non-union members and as a result the measures were thought to be a success.{nl}
 As these events unfolded, the union members were able to protest, but it had reached a point where even that had become difficult.{nl}There was nothing more for them to do except to retaliate.{nl}
 There were those who did not like that the work had been passed on to non-union Wizards, but if the situation resulted in a rebellion they were more than likely to side with the royal family. And they would have to deal with Clerics, who had the power of the Goddesses with them and the royal families and their soldiers. Along with that, it is possible that many members would leave the order.{nl}
 More importantly, there was no pretext for a rebellion.{nl}But the alliance did not stop there, and instead thought of a different method.{nl}They demanded an independent self-governing domain within the borders of the Kingdom.{nl}If they could not be leaders of the world, they would at least make the brightest city known to man.{nl}
 Although their intentions were inpractical, King Jusel had no way of preventing their request.{nl}As this was legally similar to the lands that the noble families ruled on their own.{nl}
 The alliance through various means gathered the funds necessary to purchase a plot of land. When their representative went before the Royal family to register as leader, the Royal family, taking comfort in the fact that if a situation should arise then only those in that domain would feel its effects, accepted.{nl}
 The alliance gave their new city the name Nicopolis.{nl}It wasn't long before Nicopolis saw success.{nl}As they were all gathered in one place, their efficiency saw new heights and they were able to produce magic scrolls and items that produced better effects at a cheaper cost.{nl}
 The Royal family were also pleased by the successes of Nicopolis and funds from the tax increased.{nl}And with this change, they no longer had the burden of supporting the non-alliance members.{nl}If the Wizards of Nicopolis kept to themselves, then all would be well and prosperous.{nl}
 But as we already know, this is not how things played out.{nl}To this day, the events of Nicopolis are still unknown, but the Wizards of the city were known to dabble in unprecedented magic. The side effects of which caused not only the alliance Wizards but all the citizens of Nicopolis to disappear.{nl}
 One hypothesis is that their disappearance was the result of a failed attempt to enhance their magic to its highest potential. As the side effect had no impact on the buildings of the city, we will not be able to know what exactly they were and where are those who were affected.{nl}
 The city was deserted, yet despite the passing of time the buildings of the city showed no signs of decay, remaining the same as the time it was built. All because of the magic that encased it.{nl}
 Later, as fear of the city slowly began to disappear, it was used by migrating citizens of the Kingdom and remained a fairly normal city until Medzio Diena.{nl}But the magic of the city became a burden to the citizens when the calamity that was Medzio Diena struck.{nl}
 It's still not known as to why, but compared to Fedimian and other cities, Nicopolis faced the most damage, causing those who lived there to desert the city in considerable numbers.{nl}After Medzio Diena, most citizens of the Kingdom fled to safer lands, yet it is said that there are still some who remained to make use of the more advanced equipment of the city.{nl}
 According to rumors, monsters have now gathered at the city and it's recommend that those who have no place being there, should avoid it.
 * Legend of the Mausoleum{nl}
 The source of this document is currently unknown, as it was only recently uncovered. The original material on which it was written may look like paper, but it behaves very differently from any common type of paper, a trait which continues to baffle bibliographers to this day.
 I personally suspect that this document may originate from Goddess Vaivora's Fantasy Library.{nl}
 I am certain that this document – and, by extension, records of it – did not exist before Medzio Diena. If it is true that Medzio Diena affected not only our world but the Fantasy Library as well, it is my theory that a Revelator may have entered the Library, causing some of its contents to cross over to our world as consequence.{nl}
 Unfortunately, the excerpt transcribed below is the only section of the document that has been recovered so far. We can only hope that its remaining parts will one day surface.{nl}- Year 1096 of the Kingdom{nl}Sage Master Lufas Kehel{nl}
 Enveloped in the familiar chill of the stones, Duke Kamof passed through the gateway. After all the workers had been sent away by order of the king, the room felt even cooler.{nl}The absence of humidity, if anything, confirmed to him that the structure had been built as intended.{nl}
 The mausoleum needed to remain free of humidity to avoid damaging its inner constructions. No one knew how many eras the structure would have to last, which meant that every detail required the utmost attention.{nl}
 With these thoughts crossing his mind, the duke hurried his step towards the floor below, where his lord awaited him.{nl}
 His lord was a man who had earned the honorable title of Great King after unifying the lands of the Kingdom. His name was Zachariel, but it had been years since anyone had called him by that monicker.{nl}
 Of course, no one would ever doubt that even a king has a proper name, just as no one would ever dare to call one by that name.{nl}
 To Kamof, who had known Zachariel from the times when he was only a landlord, the name now sounded unfamiliar.{nl}A couple more steps and the duke found himself in a room with the king and a few of his loyal subjects. Noticing him, King Zachariel greeted the duke with a wide smile.{nl}
 [It pleases me to know that the construction of the mausoleum is going as planned. Thank you for your efforts, Kamof.]{nl}The duke replied.{nl}[Your Majesty. The mausoleum remains unfinished. It's far too soon to send away the workers.]{nl}[I was under the impression that only this floor had been cleared.]{nl}
 [There is still work to be done here as well.]{nl}[I don't believe the work that needs to be done from now on is something we want outsiders to know.]{nl}[But Your Majesty. All the writings at the plateau were also carved by simple workers at Your Majesty's command. This is no different.]{nl}
 [The men who carved the stones may have committed no crime, but the fact remains that we erased their memories by force. We mustn't allow demons or anyone with evil intentions to covet our legacy. But I also do not wish to betray my own people in such ways ever again.]{nl}
 Determined to convince the king, Duke Kamof looked around at the other men standing by Zachariel.{nl}
 Senior vassal Nbetgeller had served the king longer than anyone in the room. Commander Jupert Killen was in charge of overseeing all military operations. And there was general Glkahn Donihue, the king's personal guard. None of them offered to help support Kamof's argument.{nl}
  Duke Denonn Sherivic, the highest aristocrat in the judicial field, was the first to speak.{nl}[I say, if His Majesty is willing to take a hammer and chisel in his own hands, who are we to refuse? I understand it is your duty to ensure the efficiency of this construction, but remember, there are much more important things to consider now.]{nl}Kamof was quick to reply.{nl}[Did I ever refuse to work for His Majesty? What I am saying is that those who have been tasked with governing the nation ought to do just that. Forgoing that work for a stonemasonry project seems awfully out of place.]{nl}
 Sherivic did not back down.{nl}[It's all been explained by His Majesty. We may not know every detail about why this mausoleum was built, but certainly you know it isn't a mere whim of His Majesty's.{nl}
 You know this structure is a provision for a catastrophe that will threaten our Kingdom and humanity itself. If not us, who do you suggest handles such an important task?]{nl}
 It was then that Glkahn Donihue, the man responsible for the king's personal protection, first intervened.{nl}
 [You are both correct. Your Majesty. The Royal Knights can complete this task under the command of our major general, if Your Majesty allows. The Royal Guard will not disclose any information concerning the mausoleum. As it happens, the men that arrived today with our major general are some of our most reliable.]{nl}
 The reply came from senior vassal Nbetgeller, who until then had remained silent.{nl}[I understand His Majesty's intentions to protect the secret of the mausoleum. However, the men in this room are our court's highest representatives. I see no reason to mistrust them.{nl}
 We must find a way to complete the task at hand without burdening the workers, nor ourselves.]{nl}[Is that possible, I ask?]{nl}At Zachariel's question, Nbetgeller explained,{nl}
 [In my opinion, even if we are to complete the task through our own efforts, it's only right that we continue performing at least some of our governing duties. That is why...]{nl}[Yes?], Zachariel urged him.{nl}
 [First, Your Majesty must allow us to use magic. Second, for the stone carvings, in lieu of hammers and chisels, we can make use of acids and chemicals to erode the stones.]{nl}[Magic and chemicals, you say. Isn't that dangerous?]{nl}
 The old vassal knew what Zachariel meant with his short question, and he did not hesitate to answer.{nl}[All we need to do is handle the chemicals carefully. As for the magic, I don't believe it will affect the mausoleum's visitors in the future.{nl}
 Your Majesty worries that our magic could someday be traced by a skilled wizard, leading them to the mausoleum and exposing our legacy to the world before the time is right. I understand that.{nl}
 But Your Majesty, in time, skin that is burned with natural fire scars no different from skin that is burned with magic.{nl}
 Any methods we use to carve our writings and symbols onto these stones will be simply that: methods. Your Majesty need not worry about them.]{nl}King Zachariel, seemingly convinced by the vassal's words, said, [Hm, is it feasible?]{nl}
 [We can use General Donihue's soldiers to carry out the task and continue to focus on our original duties. The work at the plateau is complete. According to Duke Kamof's report, the mausoleum now requires only the final details. I would say the task is perfectly feasible.]{nl}[Very well. That is what we shall do.]{nl}
 [Thank you, Your Majesty. But, if Your Majesty allows, I would like to pose a question.]{nl}[What is it?]{nl}[As far as I could tell, this mausoleum was built not for Your Majesty's eternal sleep, but for someone who is meant to visit it in the future.{nl}
 Every inner working constitutes a test to that person's skill and intelligence, not to mention the safety provisions keeping the mausoleum from being approached by enemies and thieves. And yet, the work Your Majesty has entrusted upon us now seems to contradict that purpose entirely.]{nl}
 [You are right to assume what this mausoleum is for. However, my purpose isn't simply to test those who may come for the goddess' Revelation.{nl}
 You see, I wish to leave a gift for the visitor who completes the trials of this mausoleum. The path awaiting the one who finally enters these chambers will be unimaginably strenuous. My purpose is to leave for them a token of my appreciation, as well as a valuable message.{nl}
 Who knows? To them it may be nothing but the preachings of a man who is long dead, but that is my wish.]{nl}Hearing this, Nbetgeller smiled as he prepared to address the king again.{nl}
 [Your Majesty's knowledge is that of our founding monarchs. Your Majesty's teachings will not be in vain. In fact, may I suggest that this chamber be named after that?]{nl}
 [Something like 'Hall of Knowledge', perhaps? I must say, it sounds rather awkward but it isn't so bad.]{nl}Nbetgeller added, [One cannot tell how much time will pass before the destined visitor finds their way to Your Majesty's blessed mausoleum.{nl}
 I believe it is only right to pass onto our visitor as much knowledge as Your Majesty is willing to, regardless of the value that knowledge may hold in the future.]{nl}
 [That is what I intend to do. I shall document everything that is allowed to me about deities and demons, the foundation and history of our Kingdom, and the will of the goddesses in the planning and construction of this mausoleum.{nl}
 I wish, if it is possible, that all of this is left here in this Royal Mausoleum. And if there is still space, I wish to leave my own memoir.]{nl}
 The King said these words with an air of confidence. His vassals bowed their heads in reverence not simply because he sat in a seat of power, but because he represented a piece of the Goddess' divine providence.{nl}
 Note: After discussing the matter with Cyrenia Odell, it appears that the record above about the Royal Mausoleum does not properly represent the legacy of the King.{nl}Due to this, I have done additional research and have concluded the following possiblities:{nl}
 First, there is no truth behind these documents.{nl}I, through basic reasoning, have ruled out this possibility.{nl}Two, the Royal Mausoleum was opened and through certain means the legacy of King Zachariel has been corrupted or damaged.{nl}
 And finally, three, the most likely possibility is that the real legacy of King Zachariel resides in the Great Woodlands in the mysterious mausoleum.{nl}Which means, for some particular reason, the King did not leave his legacy in his own mausoleum while at the same time requesting that his predecessors keep the second one a secret.{nl}
 If this is true, then it is now difficult for us now to know if the legacy matches with their respective kings in their appropriate tombs.{nl} 
 As the location of the mausoleum in Great Woodlands has not been confirmed, it is still difficult to conclude as to why the King and those who came after him, made such a decision.{nl}
 - Year 1096 of the Kingdom,{nl}First Year of Consul Kaonilla{nl}Sage Master Lufas Kehel
*Encyclopedia of Masters, Chapter 3{nl}
 The Masters of this edition have held their positions for years and are relatively well known.{nl}As such, I was able to write without help as I did for the last edition.{nl}However, as always, one Master writing about others of the same era can lead to unnecessary misunderstandings and drama.{nl}
 Nevertheless, I feel that without a written record, especially in this time where certain calamities, such as Medzio Diena, can cause us to forget to document our history, we will be unable to hand down our records to those of the next generation.{nl}
 Sage Master Lufas Kehel{nl}
 1. Swordsman Master Rashua{nl} Born as a commoner, Rashua rose from the lowest rank in the army to that of general.{nl}He has held the position of guard captain of the Royal family and even when he became a general he continued to oversee the training of new recruits. Because of this, he became quite well-known.{nl}
Although he has been formally discharged from service, he temporarily returned to interview new soldiers. Yet following the events of Medzio Diena there are rumors that he has returned to duty.{nl}In truth, Rashua had stepped down from heading military training, but at the request of the army it is said he has returned, although only he would know the full details.{nl}In a famous turn of events, after receiving the position again after Highlander Master Douglas Black, it was once again given to General Lamin.{nl}
 Besides this famous occurrence, not much can be spoken of in relation to the rest of his work, as the circumstances of it are closely kept military secrets.{nl}
 2. Peltasta Master Maria Leed Master{nl}Maria Leed is a particularly special character.{nl}Unlike her peers, she has no direct connection with the army.{nl}This would imply that she was a hired hand, but this too isn't quite the case.{nl}
 One can still be classified as a Master, with a preference to work alone and without being involved in either field. But this will result in fewer followers.{nl}She and the few that do follow her act as mercenaries and can be employed for a price, yet this is not their main focus.{nl}Because of her unique character and the interesting nature of her followers, she may continue to reject the Highlander Master's calls for a partnership.{nl}
 3. Pyromancer Master Abreh Melinn{nl}Abreh Melinn is an atypical Wizard who has been able to find an effective fusion between faith in the goddesses and magic research.{nl}
 Her exceptional achievement in magic is thanks to a blessing from Goddess Gabija, which also allowed her to reach previously unknown heights in fire magic.{nl}In her glory days, it is said that even Agailla Flurry's fire magic was no match for Abreh Melinn's burning flame.{nl}
 4. Wizard Master Lucia{nl}Born from a common background with average ability, it is said that Lucia was lacking in talent when first started out as a magic apprentice.{nl}
 However, with an iron will, she overcame her shortcomings and rose to the rank of Wizard. She uses her own experiences to help fledgling magic students.{nl}An avid supporter of magic, she disapproves of those who do not take their training seriously and who think lightly of the Wizard's path.{nl}
 5. Cleric Master Rozalija.{nl}Rozalija used her talents as a cleric and healer to help those in Klaipeda, Siauliai, and other such places. Because of this, despite her young age, she has received love and affection from many of the Kingdom's citizens.{nl}
As there is not a sufficient age difference between the two, it is sad to say that when the Plague Doctor Master retires, Rozaliia will not spend much time in his place.{nl}This goes to follow that maybe Rozaliia will not be given the chance to serve as Plague Doctor Master. However, should the time come where that will be necessary, all has already been prepared.{nl}During that time Rozaliia will be the acting head of both positions, Cleric Master and Plague Doctor Master until a suitable replacement for either role is found.{nl}
 6. Krivis Master Herkus{nl}Of all the Clerics, the Krivis are the most traditional followers of the Goddesses.{nl}As serious followers of tradition and times passed, many older Clerics can be found here. However, there are a few Clerics who wish to follow traditional practices of Goddess worship in their early studies.{nl}
 Followers of this path must not waver and must lead a life of faith.{nl}Luckily, Herkus has an affinity for teaching this strict devotion along with the grace of the goddesses to the people due to his years of experience as a Krivis priest.{nl}
He is also good friends with the Paladin Master.{nl}Their friendship is the background for the close relationship the two orders now share.{nl}This is the type of relationship many wish they continue to foster despite their differences in the past.{nl}
 7. Archer Master Edmundas Tiller{nl}Edmundas Tiller is a distant descendent of a royal family that fell to the rank of commoner after falling on hard times.{nl}Coming from a family of farmers he entered the army and later became a Master.{nl}
 Due to his past, he takes a particular interest in sponsoring talented people coming from unfortunate circumstances. He is also interested in the construction of the Astral Tower.{nl}Acquiring the materials necessary for repairing the walls of the city is also an important task of his as he hopes to fortify Klaipeda's defenses.{nl}
 8. Quarrel Shooter Master Ream Toiler{nl}Before Medzio Diena, Ream Toiler had a number of hobbies such as upgrading his armor and catapults while also studying the traditions of Lydia Schaffen.{nl}
 It's said that he is also the type to gain weight easily.{nl}Although he sincerely works hard, the reason for this hefty appearance is due to his nature of equally balancing his duties as Master and his personal hobbies.{nl}
 No one can deny his impressive call to action after the events of Medzio Diena.{nl}Yet there are still many who spread unfounded rumors that he is has bragged to Hunter Master, Fiona Ieva, about a sudden weight loss.
 * Ancient Affairs:{nl}Concerning Boruta{nl} 
 Five deities had gathered together.{nl}From the moment She had arrived until now, Goddess Austeja complained.{nl}[This is all wrong.]{nl}Goddess Medeina responded.{nl}[This is a decision made by both Ausrine and Giltine.]{nl}[But it was really Giltine who had decided and Ausrine simply gave in.]{nl}
 It was clear from her expression that Goddess Medeina acknowledged Austeja's rebuttal.{nl}[That may be true, but it has already been decided. At this point, it's irreversible.]{nl}[Yes, I admit that, but tell me you do not think destroying another dimension is allowed? We could have prevented that place from connecting.]{nl}
 [That would not be to Giltine's liking. Even Ausrine believed that sealing travel between the dimensions would be incomplete...]{nl}It was at this moment a voice like static cut through, disturbing the two goddesses' conversation.{nl}
 [This is entertaining. Aren't you a little obsessed with those humans? You are doing this for them, keeping their futures safe by getting rid of these dangerous beasts. I'm surprised you're this dissatisfied, Austeja.]{nl} Austeja turned to face the one who spoke.{nl}
 [Look, Baubas, you are so very annoying for someone who has lived as long as you. Our work for the humans and this are two different things. And this work from the Creator to protect the humans is not just our task but yours as well.]{nl}
 [Hahaha and that is why I am here with you, is it not? Who knows what Giltine would rather do, but I for one would rather destroy it than seal it. And to completely collapse a dimension, you'll need someone as great as Giltine. Without that, you'll need an impossible amount of force.]{nl}
 Ragana, who was standing next to Baubas, looked up at the sky as though weighing something, and then spoke.{nl}[Soon, Giltine and her minions will be done dealing with the other world. It would seem that in a bit, the remaining survivors will try to escape to this end...]{nl}
 Up until this point, the silent Goddess Zemyna muttered something under her breath.{nl}[While it may be true that compared to our world this other dimension is quite small, but would she really be able to finish everything this quickly? Even if it's Giltine...]{nl}Baubas heard this and replied.{nl}
 [The plan is not to face them one-on-one, but rather to change their world into something akin to a hell. That too would be difficult, but if she succeeds then they won't be able to stay there.]{nl}[To change their home is horrible.]{nl}This too Zemyna muttered to herself, yet it prompted a response from Baubas.{nl}
 [The structuring of that world is different and is not made from the sort of earth that you control. Giltine could be making use of that difference. She did take the Froster Lord with her so, who knows, it might become an ice hell.]{nl}
 [If that is true, then ice would kill most of them or at least cause them to flee towards us. Either way, they are headed towards death.]{nl}Ragana added.{nl}
 [There is a chance that the very strongest of them will neither die nor live and instead be completely frozen.]{nl}Medeina added her own guesswork.{nl}
 Goddess Austeja let out a sigh and spoke.{nl}[Whatever the case may be they are also living things. Yes, they are a danger to our world, but if it was at all possible simply locking them up would have been better...{nl}
 The Creator has told us to protect this world and the humans, but did not instruct us on how to do so. It was Giltine who decided to take such measures and they are ones that I cannot agree with.]{nl}
 [Well, consider what was said before. Those monsters may go into hibernation. That's almost the same as shackling them. We can just catch the ones that escape and, if you really want, you don't have to kill them. If you wish to seal them up I won't stand in your way.{nl}
 But I don't know if you have the power to do so by yourself, Austeja. If you were planning to wait here, then you can also consider helping us get rid of the beasts that are coming this way.]{nl}Baubas said.
 It was then that Goddess Medeina spoke.{nl}[We're lucky that they have not accidentally left their world to roam here. And the ones that will come will be few. Because of this only five or so of us need to wait for those who escape...]
 Goddess Zemyna replied to her sister.{nl}[That is correct for now, but if the energy of the Divine Tree continues to spread this world will become fit for those beasts and even more will arrive. Making this task harder.{nl}
 Right now it does not matter as the humans will be protected. But still, more of those beasts will encroach upon this world to cause problems. Now is the best time to protect them from such beasts.{nl}
 The energy of the Creator's Divine Tree is spreading slowly but it is as yet not a barren world.]{nl}Baubas for an indiscernible reason chuckled and said.{nl}[There are those of you who think well.]{nl}
 Austeja seemed to show a bit of resentment towards this.{nl}[We always think the correct way. You and your friends follow the Creator's wishes and yet think you are acting on your own. This is especially true of Giltine.]{nl}
 As though provoked, Ragana spoke next.{nl}[Well then, has Ausrine even once accomplished bringing you as all together as a team?]{nl}[There was never a time where it was necessary. As we concentrate on our own work we are able to complete the Creator's wishes.]{nl}
 [So like that you are all doing your work well, even Laima? When she receives prophecies and controls fortunes, what is she doing? Is there nothing to fix? Or do you know and would rather not share it with us? Is that it?]{nl}
 [Is there a sister who does not know of the persecution Laima faces from knowing the future? You know of this too, don't you, Ragana? Receiving these powers from the Creator is not something that we can play with. Furthermore, it is a power that one cannot use for one's own ambition.]{nl}
 [So you're saying that Giltine wants the power handed down from the Creator for herself?]{nl}[That is not what I'm saying. I'm saying that Giltine is using it as justification for her to have her way and overreacting by destroying a whole dimension...]{nl}At this, Ragana interrupted Austeja.{nl}
 [You may argue the pros and cons of Giltine but since the eternal sleep of the Creator, the truth is, we have not seen a greater leader than Giltine.{nl}
 This is a task that Ausrine has also supported. To round up and kill those beasts so that the world and the humans you love have a future. It's clear that these circumstances are unavoidable despite it not being to your or Ausrine's liking.{nl}
 But it is here that Baubas and I have come to provide help, however, make it known that we do so not for the humans.]{nl}
 At Ragana's words Austeja and she made eye contact. There was nothing logical that Austeja could say in retort and rather than denouncing Giltine she decided to avoid further conflict by averting her eyes.{nl}
 And that was when Medeina spoke.{nl}[We are responsible. Although we have our differences, we cannot continue to quarrel. Are we not here for the sake of this world? And more importantly, the very beasts we have been waiting for will soon make an appearance.]{nl}
 In that moment, in the air, black dots appeared.{nl}These beasts, bearing wings, were falling out of the sky.{nl}As an effect of their unintentional and haphazard dimensional travel, they were unable to use their wings despite their efforts.{nl}
 There were a few who were able to unfurl their wings, yet rather than fly they tried to their best to glide themselves into a soft landing.{nl}
 Goddess Medeina spoke the words,{nl}[They cannot be left alone,]{nl} and reaching out her hand she summoned countless arrows of light to swarm upwards and into the blue sky.{nl}
 As the first of the beasts to adapt had yet to collect themselves, the arrows hit their mark perfectly. If they had not, the beasts would have landed where the five deities were waiting. Instead, they were thrown off their mark and fell elsewhere nearby.{nl}
 Baubas saw this and spoke to Goddess Zemyna.{nl}[When they hit the ground use that earth power of yours to trap them. It'll be annoying if they fly off.]{nl}She replied.{nl}[That's fine, but I'll need some time to properly bind them.{nl}
 Ragana responded.{nl}[Is that necessary? If we kill them all, it'll be fine. That's all the time we will need.]{nl}But Baubas had other thoughts.{nl}
 [It will be pointless if they escape. Let us go with the original plan. Ensure that not one of them flies free. Austeja can stay out of the fight and instead protect Zemyna until she completes the ceremony. That way you two won't have to get your hands dirty...]{nl}
 When Baubas said this the two goddesses agreed to the task.{nl}In a matter of seconds, in the distant sky, more dots appeared that caught the god's eyes. It was more of the beasts.{nl}Later, in legends, these monsters would be known to humans as dragons.{nl}
 Medeina once again sent a score of arrows into the air.{nl}The vast majority of these dragons who had come to this world to escape the onslaught from Giltine crashed to the ground. The impact killing many, while those who were still hanging on were in no better condition.{nl}
 Regardless, there were some who did not die from the impact and were able to avoid Medeina's attack.{nl}However, despite their efforts to glide to safety, these remaining dragons were unable to control their drift and crashed into the ground.{nl}
 As a result, there was not one dragon who reached the ground unscathed.{nl}Baubas looked about him and said.{nl}[If I had known that these would be the only ones to arrive, I could have handled this on my own.]{nl}
 To everyone's surprise, it was not the goddesses who responded, but Ragana.{nl}[If you were alone, more of them would have survived and Zemyna too would not be here to tie them up.]{nl}[Everyone lent a hand, you know.]{nl}[It's just there were not as many here as Laima foresaw...]{nl}
 [Meaning you do not trust in her predictions...]{nl}Having already expressed those feelings to Ragana privately, Baubas turned his attention back to the battlefield,{nl} where there still remained a dragon on the brink of death.{nl}[Well look at that. Leave him to me. You all can clean up the rest.]{nl}
 Without waiting for a response, he set out to fight the beast.{nl}Medeina let out a sigh, and Ragana watched briefly as Baubas walked away, before they both set about on their own task of checking for survivors.{nl}It was work that involved ensuring that the dead dragons really were dead.{nl}
 As Baubas approached his target, he began to hear the dragon.{nl}It was not through voice, but it was possible for them to communicate.{nl}[You with the wicked smell, who are you? You devils have destroyed our home forcing us to come here. What possible reason could you have to commit such a crime?]{nl} 
 Baubas replied with a sneer as an answer to the question.{nl}However, this proved ineffective as the dragon had no knowledge of the demon gods and goddesses of this world and thus disregarded the expression.{nl}
 However, as their minds were in tune with each other Baubas was able to convey the meaning behind the gesture.{nl}[You have a lot of questions. But it will be difficult to tell you my name in your language. I believe the same will hold true for you as well.{nl}
 Regardless, if I am to answer you, although I do not know how it will be received, my name is Baubas. Your name from ancient times would be Boruta in our language.{nl}
 And as a sign of kindness, to answer your other question, it is because your kind has wandered that extinction became necessary. I don't know about Austeja, but it means nothing to me. I mean that I do not care about justifying myself to such creatures.{nl}
 To think of you as something that has intelligence and should be respected, it is quite annoying. I see you as something I can release my anger upon. As I cannot fight my fellow gods and humans are much too weak.]{nl}
 [Huh? Our kind? Humans? What do you mean?]{nl}[At that's right. You had no interest in knowing about this world or what type of beings live here, but suddenly you would appear and devour what was here, am I not right? Because of that sort of stupid attitude, it's obvious as to why you are where you are today.{nl}
 If there weren't so many of you I would have finished you all off myself, but Giltine being both wiser and stronger has more efficiently rounded you up as so. And seeing how it turned out, even Austeja would agree.]{nl} 
 [Cease! No matter what you say it is because of you that our kind has been slaughtered. This world's concerns mean nothing to us. To avoid the predictor you have started your destiny with this game.]{nl}[That is true, but you do not know the subject of the matter.]{nl}
 With that said, Baubas went into action.{nl}Baubas launched an attack on Boruta's back.{nl}Boruta believed he could stop the blow but it proved futile.{nl}It was because his speed was quicker and his attacks sharper than those of dragons.{nl}
 It was the first time in Boruta's life to feel such pain. He was just barely able to block the second attack with his claw.{nl}At least, so he thought.{nl}He did in fact block the blow but as a consequence his claw fractured.{nl}
 His claw, unlike its back, would be able to heal in a matter of moments, but Baubas used this moment of weakness to attack at Boruta's back again.{nl}With the claw destroyed, Baubas could have easily attacked another location, such as the wings, but instead decided to aim for the torso, clearly not giving the battle his all.{nl}
 [At this rate my full strength, let alone a weapon, will not be necessary...]{nl}It was here that Boruta came to realize the embarrassing truth. In a one-to-one fight against Baubas, he would be unable to win.{nl}
 Baubas had also mentioned in passing that if there were not so many and the fight was fair, there would be a chance he would win.{nl}It was exactly because of this strength and number that they have lived so peacefully in their own world for so many years.{nl}
 Even after discovering this other world, these beasts were so involved in themselves that they did not concern themselves with the beings this world calls gods.{nl}But the price of this ignorance was costly.{nl}They were massacred and before Boruta stood his own death.{nl}
 Boruta unfurled his right wing, successfully whipping Baubas away. As Baubas came in for another attack, Boruta was able to send him flying again.{nl}Now that the strength in his wings had returned, he planned to rise.{nl}Yet his intention was not to flee but to attack from a better position.{nl}
 But in the next moment, the realization came to him. He was unable to take flight.{nl}Although Boruta was unable to identify Baubas' expression, Baubas was overcome with satisfaction watching Boruta's moment of failure.{nl}This time around, he sprung towards the dragon, directing a blow to his head.{nl} 
 The pain of such blows to his torso and head where unknown to Boruta.{nl}It was because an attack had never drilled through his leather hide.{nl}Of course, this does not mean that in their world, when fights broke out there was an absence of dragons who suffered such damaging blows.{nl}
 There were those who yowled after facing such an attack, while there were others with worse damages who kept their mouths firmly shut.{nl}As Boruta was always on the winning end, this level of pain was one he had yet to experience.{nl}But now in this strange world from a strange being he was being taught how much his body could endure and the distressing truth that he wasn't as strong as he thought.{nl}
 Seen another way, one could believe that the dragon was simply unlucky.{nl}No matter the situation, he could not win.{nl}As such he must run.{nl}As he could not fly, his only means of escape was to carry his wounded body on foot.{nl}
 Yet, following behind the dragon was a carefree and smiling Baubas.{nl}Although Boruta was running, he was still easily overcome by the Demon God Baubas' casual pace.{nl}Because of his wounds and the superior power of Baubas, Boruta was no longer in a situation where he could escape.{nl}
 At that moment, without a sound, Austeja appeared at Baubas' side.{nl}Even though he had only heard the sound of wings, Baubas was aware of Her arrival.{nl}As he turned his head towards Her, She spoke.{nl}
 [Let him be.]{nl}[Haha sorry but you cannot just ask to have things your way. Why? Why should I let him go?]{nl}[He might be the last of the dragons...]{nl}
 [That may be true but, there may still be survivors in their own world as well. Not just here, but how are we to know there aren't survivors in the other places.]{nl}[Yes but, at least here there are none.]{nl}[So we save him and then he'll kill the humans? That beast may not know their strength, but without effort he could easily devour them all.]{nl}
 [We can hide him somewhere underground. That way, Zemyna, who reigns over the earth, will be aware of his location. We just have to seal him so he doesn't escape. If we seal him deep within the earth, without the strength of Zemyna nor the Creator, no one will be able to free it. Even for Ausrine and Giltine it will be difficult.]{nl}
 [This type of attitude suits you. Fine. If that's what you want, let's do it. But I'm curious about two things.]{nl}[And that would be?]{nl}[No, three things. When will I get to hear your begging again? When will I get to see you fight? And when will Boruta again be released? These three things I'm curious about.]{nl}
 [All three are impossible.]{nl}Austeja's expression hardened in response.{nl}[Huh, don't joke too much. You never know when the time will come again when you will need another favor from me. Or when we too will have to fight. Whether the Creator awakens or that power engulfs the world again.]{nl}
 [If you want payment for saving it...]{nl}[And I want that now. I enjoy killing but I hate the cleanup. Yet someone needs to deal with these dragon carcasses. I see this duty fit for you to thank me for all that I've done.]{nl} Like this, Baubas spoke and before Austeja could respond, he departed.{nl}
 But it wasn't the leftover work that Baubas had pushed upon Her that stayed with Her. It was the gloomy foreboding thought that {nl}'whatever occurs, Laima knows all.'{nl}Her eyes fell upon the body of the dragon before Her and She began Her work.
 * Herrmun-Madale{nl}River Crossing Incident Vol. 1{nl}
 Fifty one days had passed since the death of King Zachariel.{nl}He had died at the age of 51 and it was his son, Jeromel, who received the title of Lord. He now sat on the throne with his head in his hands.{nl}Over twenty lords and the royal family congregated together at the palace to commiserate the passing. They were well aware of the dilemma the king was facing, but since no one wanted to be the first to bring up the topic, they waited in silence.{nl}
 It was Licsion, brother to the King, who finally spoke.{nl}[There is nothing more to say. We will command them to cease on the King's orders. If they do not listen, we may then use military force. Whoever you send, shall not be defeated. On your command, any one of us will go.]{nl}
 [But if this suggestion is followed, the peace we have had for 40 years will be broken. And in history, our king would be recorded as the one who was inaugurated and then went to war. He would be known as the king who was unable to keep the peace his ancestors had restored.]{nl}
 These words came from the next in line to the throne, the crown prince. Another member of the royal family spoke next.{nl}[Let us use a royal order to evict them. If needed we can extend their territories. Rather than punishing them for insubordination, pursuing disciplinary action would be more justifiable.]{nl}
 Another member spoke.{nl}[If we command them to cease their fighting and they do not listen, will they then listen to us as we command them to change their dominion? There is a high possibility that they will ignore us and we will have no choice but to mobilize the troops.{nl}
 The King will have no choice but to see this as a mutiny. This will also destroy the peace our previous kings have fought for since the founding of this Kingdom. This too will result in a revolt.]{nl}
 The first member to speak, spoke again.{nl}[Who here does not know this? In any case, is there no better reason than this to use the army? And if a war begins, their lack of military strategy will be their downfall.{nl}
 Their troops may be greater, but they will not have the help of the wizards and the goddesses' priests. Those families may have confidence in their fighting abilities but they will ultimately be at a disadvantage.]{nl}Although he spoke as such, his confidence did not match the tone of his words.{nl}
 The issue facing the nobles and the royal families was as follows.{nl}The Herrmun Family and the Madale family were currently the two strongest nobilities in the Kingdom.{nl}And as luck would have it, they shared neighboring territories.
 Just like typical neighbors, they could not coexist in peace and, although during the 40-year reign of King Zachariel the two families did not publicly show their displeasure, it was inevitable that their hostility would erupt into conflict.{nl} 
 As the ruling power of the Kingdom was passing hands for the second time, the pressure placed upon the noble families was lessened, thus giving the two ambitious families an opportunity they could not overlook.{nl}
 It was not in defiance of the Kingdom, but thinking that there would be no other opportunity before them, they took action. Thus believing that if a result could be determined, then the royal family would have no choice to but accept.{nl}
 And as both families were headed by those who felt confident in their military prowess, they believed that this was the only way forward.{nl}
 On one hand, in the early days ascension disputes were settled with the Kingdom's military, but if the new King's ascension to power was indeed disputed the moment the previous King had passed away, this displeasure would have been known.{nl}There was not one person who wanted to go against the royal family nor who sided with the feuding nobles.{nl}
 As such, they would not receive help from the priests and the wizards thus, objectively, it would result in a win for the throne. However, the two families' boasting of military prowess is not an overstatement.{nl}
 In any case, one side would win and one would lose. If the king's army was to appear,  the two noble families would deal with these soldiers first. If this was the case and they advanced even one step the situation could become uncontrollable.{nl}
 The royal family's authority to rule would be questioned as the army would be criticized for its weakness. If news spread to the nobles who swear allegiance to the throne the foundation of the Kingdom would be shaken.{nl}
 However, thanks to the goddesses the unified Kingdom would remain and the priests, through the goddesses, would keep the Kingdom safe. But the royal presence would be but a memory as nobles from all regions chose to do as they like. And the royal name would be ignored as the country falls into chaos.{nl}
 There were no instances in history that could be referenced, but King Jeromel and those who were gathered here knew that the foundation of the Kingdom was not on the monarch but on a change lead forth by the second monarch.{nl}Again, a silence lingered until finally, Duke Greeo, the eldest of the nobles who gathered here, spoke.{nl}
 [From what I know, currently the Royal Army has 24,000 troops. And when the previous King had checked, the total number of troops that could be mobilized in the case of an emergency was estimated at 170,000. If you choose to limit the number of guards in each city, you will be able to mobilize more.{nl}
 If the Duke of Herrmun mobilizes his troops, they will be about 12,000 strong. Duke Madale would be 8,000. Therefore, together about 20,000 troops. If both sides slander their fortunes and hire the maximum amount of mercenaries while also mobilizing another nobles' of whom they are close with, the total could be doubled to 40,000.]{nl}[Why are you suddenly doing such calculations?]{nl} 
 [If we use 24,000 troops from the king's army against these 40,000 troops we will be using military force, but if we only send 4,000 it would not appear as such. This will not be enough to stop a war or to take disciplinary action. But, it is more than enough to be used as escorts for a representative of the royal family.]{nl}
 A silence followed after Greeo's words and King Jeromel was the first to break it.{nl}[If the rank of this representative is high enough that would be an acceptable amount of troops. For example, if it was a king, correct?] His brother, Licsion, shared a thought.{nl}
 [But we are not saying that Your Majesty should be the one to go. But if these troops did not escort a king, then it would be excessive.]{nl}The first to speak of such an idea, Duke Greeo, spoke again.{nl}
 [This is why the crown prince must be the one to go. With this we can properly assess the situation while also showing that we take such issues seriously and present a dignified appearance.]{nl}Licsion heard this and was quick to reply.{nl}
 [This would be a good chance to bestow onto the crown prince His Majesty's title. He would then be Jeromel II.{nl}Like this, we can take care of things under the king's title.{nl}
 By the authority of the king, he will receive this title and complete the work set before him.{nl}This will also secure the next line of succession.]{nl}
 Another member of the family spoke.{nl}[Sending the crown prince with an imperial authority will carry more weight. Like this, he can address the situation directly and deal with whatever problems that may occur. I see no problem with this.{nl}
 However, I'm curious as to how Duke Greeo came to the conclusion of 4,000 troops. if your decision is not to appear strong, then why not 3,000 or why not more, such as 5,000? My intention is not to shine doubt on this, but rather for us to collectively discern the correct number of troops that we need to send.]{nl}
 And this, Duke Greeo replied.{nl}[Because if necessary, we may need to use military force. 4,000 may not be able to repress the opposition, but they will easily be able to join together with other forces if necessary.{nl}
 I previously calculated that there would be 40,000 troops. But in truth, they may be less than that. If we take into account that our opponent cannot use priests or wizards, then in truth the number of troops could be two times less.]{nl}
 Now the question of where to get such troops could not be avoided.{nl}But before it was raised, the Duke answered.{nl}
 [We will request troops from the Kingdom's noble families. I, of course, will be the first to gather my troops. Although we cannot predict how many will answer the call, I believe we can gather 40,000.{nl}
 4,000 is one-tenth of 40,000, which is a decent number to go with the crown prince. And 40,000 will match the number of both sides' men. We will be able to defeat them with this amount and we can use the priests and wizards if the situation calls for it.{nl}
 The crown prince will try to persuade both sides and if that fails we can use military force. If it comes to this, it will not only be the royal family in attendance but all of the Kingdom's noble families as well. It will become a situation that justifies dispatching the soldiers.]{nl}
 King Jeromel opened his mouth to speak again.{nl}[Not much time has passed since my ascension to the throne and already my title has been changed from Jeromel to Jeromel I. This is good. If none oppose this decision, it will be accepted.{nl}
 Operational plans and military decisions will be headed by the crown prince, while reports will be made to me.]{nl}There was no one in the palace who opposed the decision and for the time being this was their response to the situation.
 Below is a popular lore scholars believe was written during the reign of King Melkhiel.{nl}Various records of the adventures of Taokaka exist, but it is safe to believe the story documented here is closest to the original.{nl}
 - Sage Master Lufas Kehel{nl}
 * The Adventures of Taokaka{nl}
 One day, on a secluded path, Taokaka came across a demon.{nl}Since he was a polite boy regardless of the situation he decided to address the demon himself.{nl}This was also not the first time for Taokaka to come across such danger and as such he was already experienced in such things.{nl}
 [Hello, what are you doing?]{nl}[I'm spinning the wheel of destiny.]{nl}The demon answered curtly.{nl}There was, in fact, a spinning wheel before the demon.{nl}
 [A wheel? And why are you spinning it?]{nl}[This is the wheel of destiny. By spinning the wheel one can take away what another has and give to them what they did not. The fruits of these trades are within the wheel. Spinning the wheel again will randomly give one to the owner.]{nl}
 [That sounds nice.]{nl}[Maybe not. The wheel will return to the target something they hold dear, something they have forgotten, but what it will give to the owner cannot be surmised.{nl}
 And if you're the owner of the wheel, you must spin it seven times. Whatever escapes on the seventh spin, must be accepted.]{nl}[Where are you at now?]{nl}[Six.]{nl}
 [Then will you spin it again?]{nl}[Only if you agree to accept it.]{nl}[And if I don't?]{nl}[Then I will kill you.]{nl}[Well, it seems I have no choice.]{nl}
 [Yes. I have killed those before you who rejected me. If you fear death, then don't delay and accept this magic wheel. Accept it and I will leave with whatever gift the wheel grants me.{nl}
 All this time I have carefully chosen who to spin the wheel for and now only good remains within it. Now if I spin the wheel, it will take something cherished from you, and give something for you and something for me. This also means that whatever you receive won't be bad.{nl}
 Of course, if this wasn't the seventh rotation, then there is no need for two gifts to appear. It always takes one and gives one.]{nl}[Alright. Well spin the wheel, then give it to me.]{nl}The demon, with a mixed sense of freedom and accomplishment, spun the spinning wheel one last time.{nl}
 Both the demon and Taokaka knew that the wheel took something from Taokaka, but what it was they did not know.{nl}The demon saw this and spoke.{nl}
 [It must be something abstract like a feeling. That's why it can't be seen. If it was something like intelligence or courage, you would suddenly become stupid or filled with fear. Since that's not the case, at the moment, whatever it is can't be known.]{nl}
 As the demon said that, something from the wheel entered him.{nl}It could not be seen, but what it was could easily be known.{nl}The demon's appearance changed into something more sinister.{nl}Whoever saw could tell that the demon had obtained additional strength.{nl}
 He gave a sinister, demonic smile and spoke.{nl}[I have obtained unbelievable strength. With this, in the demon realm I can win the rank of Demon Lord. Endless vitality would have been more beneficial in surviving the many battles but I'm pleased with this improvement. 
 Regardless, things have turned out well. Boy, I'm leaving. Before you spin the wheel on me. Hahahaha!]{nl}With those words, the demon disappeared without a trace.{nl}
 Taokaka, without a stir, simply picked up the wheel and said, [Well then wait, we will meet again...]{nl}And he continued walking.{nl}
 As he walked with the wheel in hand, he was pulled towards the sound of music in the distance and followed it to an open field in the forest where a group of people was holding a masquerade.{nl}Taokaka spun the wheel and the music was absorbed.{nl}
 It was because, here, music was the most precious commodity.{nl}In return, the wheel gave those at the masquerade the virtue of honesty. In that moment, they ripped off their masks and revealed to each other their true selves.{nl}
 Taokaka continued on his journey once again.{nl}On the path before him was a toy knife.{nl}It was shaped like a sword, but it was a toy just bigger than the size of one's palm.{nl}Here, Taokaka spun the wheel.{nl}From the toy knife came its most precious possession, fun.{nl}
 And because what the toy knife was missing was an owner, the wheel gave it one. Its new owner became Taokaka.{nl}
 Now carrying both the wheel and the toy knife, Taokaka continued walking and met a person apathetically working on the soil.{nl}In front of this person, Taokaka spun the wheel. 
 From the wheel came the fun that was taken from the toy knife. With this, the bored worker suddenly realized the insurmountable excitement he could have from his work.{nl}And in return, the wheel took what was most important to him, one day's wage.{nl}
 As though struck by a dream, the worker understood that he would miss one day's wage, but since tomorrow too he could enjoy his work and be paid, all was well.{nl}
 And although he was not there and did not know the proceedings of where and how to deliver this wage, the worker's employer went about doing so without a second thought.{nl}
 As Taokaka continued on his way, he passed many people and places, but if the need to spin the wheel did not come, he moved on.{nl}With that in mind, when he came across a discarded wine bottle, he spun the wheel.{nl}
 The feelings of intoxication and drunkenness entered the wheel.{nl}And in return, it gave music.{nl}Now if one had the wine, one would not get drunk but rather would hear the sounds of music. And Taokaka continued on.{nl}
 Time passed before Taokaka stopped before the corpse of a fallen knight.{nl}It was clear that the knight had fought to his death.{nl}Nearby was what appeared to be his sword and the signs of a struggle.{nl}
 Taokaka spun the spinning wheel before the corpse.{nl}The powerful death of the fallen knight entered the wheel.{nl}And the wheel gave the corpse what the demon had spoken of before he had left, endless vitality.{nl}
 When the fallen knight received the gift, he was revived.{nl}He spoke to Taokaka and gave him his thanks.{nl}From the knight, Taokaka learned that the killer was the demon from whom he had received the wheel.{nl}
 And from the knight he also learned that the demon had traveled to various other places, leaving a path of destruction in his wake as he searched to obtain only the best.{nl}He learned that the knight had died in pursuit of this vile demon.{nl}
 The knight said he would pursue the demon again, and Taokaka said he too was in pursuit.{nl}This is because Taokaka wanted to take back what the wheel had taken from him.{nl}
 To get back what was taken someone must be the target of the spin and Taokaka believed his target must be the demon.{nl}Therefore, Taokaka and the knight set off together to find him.{nl}Since the seventh spin of the wheel must be saved for the demon, Taokaka resolved to spin the wheel once more.{nl}
 After careful deliberation, Taokaka selected the toy knife and spun the wheel again.{nl}The wheel gave to the toy the death that was taken from the knight's corpse.{nl}
 But what it took was its ownership. The knife was no longer Taokaka's nor was it anyone else's.{nl}Put other way, one could say the rights of ownership were taken from the toy and now belonged to the wheel.{nl}
 Although the wheel had taken death from the knight's corpse, it was not the only thing that it gave the toy knife as now death itself was unclear and the knife's very concept of ownership was altered.{nl}
 Regardless, now whomever touched the toy had nothing before them but their demise.{nl}As without an owner, it would become an uncontrollable knife of death.{nl}But as luck would have it, the revived knight carried within him endless vitality and as such was unable to be killed by the death pervading the knife.{nl}
 And as such, the knight became its sole owner.{nl}With the knife under his control, the two set off again on their journey in pursuit of the demon.{nl}And before long, they came across the demon who had given Taokaka the wheel. The demon spoke first.{nl}
 [This is quite unusual. To meet you again and even more so, to be greeted by this knight that I have already killed. How are you alive?]{nl}Taokaka replied.{nl}[That's not important.]{nl}[Then what is? Human boy.]{nl}
 The demon asked and Taokaka answered.{nl}[Returning to me what had left when you had spun the wheel. In other words, I want what was cut from me. Good or bad it was mine.]{nl}
 This sparked the demon's curiosity and he asked,{nl}[Alright, then what was it that the wheel cut?]{nl}[As my grandmother once told me, since the day I was born I received a blessing from the goddess. A blessing of luck tied to misfortune, she said.]{nl}
 [Luck tied to misfortune?]{nl}[Yes. The misfortune is the reason why I meet demons like you or other dangers, but because of the luck I always win. But this time, it has been cut and a part of that blessing has entered the wheel.]{nl}
 As soon as he heard this, the knight spoke.{nl}[Whatever the case, it seems what has entered the wheel must be luck. And since the bad luck has nowhere to go, it attached itself to someone else.]{nl}
 Taokaka nodded and replied.{nl}[It seems that way. This is why you have met me again.]{nl}As he said these words, he spun the spinning wheel.{nl}By then it was already too late for the demon to escape and whatever came out from the wheel was what he would have to accept.{nl}
 The wheel spun, but the demon who understood the nature behind the wheel believed he still had a chance.{nl}He would gather his strength, attack Taokaka and the knight and steal the wheel again.{nl}Even if the wheel took what strength it had given, he would still have his original power which would be enough to finish the task, he thought.{nl}
 However, the wheel did not take away from the demon the strength it had given.{nl}Instead, it took from him the misfortune that had caused him to meet Taokaka again.{nl}
 This was good for the demon until the wheel rewarded him with the intoxication and drunkenness that it had taken from the wine bottle.{nl} The demon did not lose himself in his drunken state, but he had no choice but to be overcome by the feeling.{nl}
 As a result, he was unable to speak and stumbled along until he fell to the ground.{nl}At this point, Taokaka felt no further need to spin the wheel.{nl}This is because the luck from the goddess' blessing had been released and rejoined with the misfortune that had left the demon, before finally being returned to Taokaka.{nl}
 The fallen demon, who knew his only choice now was to use the wheel, fumbled in a drunken stupor towards Taokaka.{nl}Taokaka gently rested the wheel on the ground and stepped back. The demon, with a smile of satisfaction that only a drunkard could make, picked up the wheel.{nl}
 The same smile plastered on his face, he spun the wheel.{nl}The wheel took from the demon his intoxication and rewarded him with the power of ownership.{nl}
 Like that, the demon became the everlasting owner of the wheel and become unable to pass on the wheel to anyone or anything in existence.{nl}Moreover, the demon knew that the wheel had taken his intoxication but he had yet to realize what it had given him.{nl}
 As the demon sat there puzzled, still considering the situation, the knight stepped forward and touched the demon with the tip of the toy's blade.{nl}As the demon's thoughts were preoccupied with other matters, he did not think twice to avoid the attack, believing the weapon to be a mere toy.{nl}
 But in this knife was death and it killed the demon where he sat.{nl}And with his death also meant the death of the owner of the spinning wheel.{nl} 
 Although they tried, the knight and Taokaka came to realize that they could no longer spin the wheel, let alone even pick it up.{nl}
 In the end, the knight and Taokaka left.{nl}And not too long afterward, Goddess Laima appeared.{nl}As there was no one in possession of the spinning wheel, Goddess Laima was now able to retrieve it with ease.{nl}
 And so, with the wheel of destiny returned to the goddess who rules one's fate, Goddess Laima disappeared.{nl}And it is here where the story of Taokaka, and his bottle of wine that does not intoxicate but plays music, and the knight, with the knife that can kill all, comes to an end.
 * Chridela Otero Diaries Pt. 1{nl}
 In a small, tattered house, an old man reached out with his hand from the crude bed where he lay.{nl}Chridela took her father's hand into her own.{nl}
 [I'm sorry, Chridela. It's my own fault that I wasted my noble blood only to die like this. I only regret never having done anything for you.]{nl}
 The girl shook her head.{nl}[Please don't say that. You have to get better.]{nl}[If only I had the fortune of your grandfather, your future would have been very different.]{nl}[I can take care of my future.]{nl}[I'm sorry.]{nl}
 Her father repeated the words one more time when, as if all energy had left him, he closed his eyes and fell asleep.{nl}Chridela, having skipped already two meals in a row, succumbed to hunger and fatigue as she, too, went to sleep.{nl}When she woke up, her father had already left the world.{nl}
 After the humble funeral, arranged with the help of the villagers, young Chridela could do nothing but cry in her empty house. Her tears had only just dried out when she heard someone knock on the door.{nl}
 Chridela didn't answer, but the door wasn't locked, and they came in through the open door.{nl}There were two of them; one was the village elder, the other was a man she didn't recognize.{nl}
 The man took one look at Chridela and sighed. He said to her,{nl}[I know your father met someone like me not long ago, and I know it won't be easy hearing what I have to say to you, but...]{nl}
 Before he could continue, Chridela wiped her face to stare boldly at the man.{nl}[An Otero never avoids responsibility, for better or for worse. What is it that you came to tell me?]{nl}The man looked back with a hint of surprise on his face.{nl}
 [You are brave for such a young girl. People used to say no one in the family was half as good as Manel Otero.]{nl}The man observed Chridela's expression, but the fact that he had just insulted her family didn't seem to bother her.{nl}
 It wasn't that she didn't understand, she was only being cautious.{nl}The man was again surprised by her attitude.{nl}This time, he addressed her in a serious tone.{nl}
 [Manel Otero, the founder of your family, was granted noble status under His Majesty, King Termanel, the 38th ruler of our Kingdom. By the third generation, all of your family's property, assets and valuables had been either sold or impounded.{nl}
 Paintings by Sakkurrhe, the great artist of King Wardel's era, were let go at a price that doesn't nearly compare to their value. A most regretful decision, if I may say. Your father had nothing but the noble status of his name, and now he is no more.]{nl}
 [You don't have to tell me what I already know. You should start by telling me who you are.]{nl}[Oh! Where are my manners? I am Kdit, from the Kedora Merchant Alliance. I can't really say it's nice to meet you at a time like this.{nl}
 Alas, this is how we had to meet. I'm surprised you were already aware of all of that. But there's something you need to know.]{nl}
 Chridela waited for the man to continue.{nl}[Your father may have been born to a noble family, but under our law, that privileged status does not last forever. The Otero family has never made significant contributions to the Kingdom. What's more, they wasted their reputation and wealth throughout the generations.{nl}
 That is why your noble status has been revoked. Your family will no longer receive the benefits granted to the noble class, particularly in the fiscal sector. Perhaps fortunately, your family has no more wealth to benefit from. This house and all it contains will also become property of the Kedora Alliance.{nl}
 Though it's a fortunate thing your father owes us and not another agency. We are not the type to strip a poor orphan girl of all her belongings to avoid losses. That said, we can't let you stay in this house anymore.{nl}
 It's not just a matter of paying off your father's debt. You need to live with a legal guardian until you're an adult.]{nl}[A guardian?]{nl}
 [Or you can be sent to an orphanage run by the clerics, though I do think a guardian is your best option. You'll be sent to your ruling lord, where you'll receive work and education. Most take the chance to learn a profession they can follow as adults. If you're talented enough, there's nothing you can't learn.{nl}
 The lord is required by the law to pay for your upbringing, no matter how costly. Of course, if you're looking for more than basic education, you'll have to pay it all back to the lord once you become an adult.]{nl}
 [So I get to live in the lord's castle?]{nl}[Not quite... Normally that is what happens, but your case is different. Someone else has volunteered to be your guardian.]{nl}[Who?]{nl}[I cannot tell you; not yet. But don't worry. Becoming an orphan's legal guardian is not only a matter of wealth or will, and we at the Kedora Alliance would never disregard the safety of a child.]{nl}
 Kdit paused for a moment.{nl}[You don't have to call a neighbor, we will be taking you to your guardian ourselves.{nl}
 Forgive me for this remark but, financially, what we're doing here is a loss for the Kedora Alliance.{nl}
 This old house and everything in it is not enough to repay your father's loan. However, we will allow you to take anything you want with you.{nl}
 That includes objects you may have hidden outside the house, of course, as long as you're able to carry them. Make sure to take anything you think is necessary or important.{nl}
 We won't check even if you're hiding gold bars or other valuables, so I recommend you take as many as possible. Everything you leave behind will be appropriated and reutilized by the Alliance. We will you give you a few hours to prepare. When we return, I expect you to be ready to leave.]{nl}
 Chridela acquiesced and Kdit gave her a short nod before exiting through the front door. The village elder quietly expressed his condolences to the girl before leaving the house.{nl}Kdit was still nearby when the elder came out.{nl}
 They had promised Chridela time to prepare, so they began walking towards the village.{nl}A few steps on their way, the elder turned to Kdit.{nl}[I have to say, the Kedora Alliance is much more... generous than what I had imagined.]{nl}
 Kdit smiled abashedly.{nl}[There's always something to be gained in everything the Alliance does. We give when we must give, and we take when we must take. It's only a question of maintaining balance. In a way, we can afford to be generous because of how effectively we make a profit.]{nl}
 The village elder didn't quite agree with Kdit, but he chose not to contradict him.{nl}Instead, he said,{nl}
 [I'm glad you found a guardian for Chridela. Our village doesn't have the means to look after the girl, and sending her to work for the lord would mean an entire life of menial jobs. She would probably end up in someone else's land, the poor girl...]{nl}
 [That doesn't sound like a bad life at all.]{nl}[Considering she comes from a noble family, I would rather she followed another path, that's all.]{nl}Silently, Kdit nodded in agreement.{nl}
 In his mind, however, the Kedora Alliance official had other thoughts.{nl}'If she fails to prove herself to her guardian, she might as well marry a farmer and live a quiet life in the countryside. She may not have a choice right now, but with her attitude, there's no telling what the future of this girl will be...'
 * Chridela Otero Diaries Pt. 2{nl}
 Chridela Otero followed a man down a dark corridor.{nl}He walked one step ahead of her, his back turned to Chridela. The man's name was Frium.{nl}She had never been fond of him, so she did not try to start a conversation. It was Frium who broke their silence.{nl}
 [Honestly, I've always admired you. I mean, out of the 29 boys and girls he sponsored, look at how many actually got to the level he expected. Almost none! But you... You exceeded all expectations.{nl}
 At your age, the only person who can compare to you in combat is probably the Fencer Master, that Sorsha girl. And she's a Hutton; she was practically born with a sword in her hands. Considering how much you achieved in only five years, I'd say you're pretty remarkable.]{nl}
 Chridela couldn't stand being quiet any longer.{nl}[Even the least talented of us was still above average. It was you who set the standards too high, for no good reason.]{nl}
 [You think so? Our high standards weren't there to measure your achievements, you know. Dedication, loyalty... that's what we were looking for. Or at least a level of talent that could make up for the lack of those things.{nl}
 To be honest, I don't really trust you. But I don't think you're a dishonest person, either. What I do know for sure is that you are a very talented woman. Frighteningly so.]{nl}
 [Well, you're something special yourself. For someone who can't defend himself, you're pretty brave around people who don't exactly fancy you.]{nl}
 [Eh, when you're running a battle arena you get used to being around fighters, murderers, all sorts of scary people. I'm just doing my job. You can't let something as irrational as fear get in the way of your dreams.]{nl}
 [Oh, I know. In fact, I learned that from you, Frium. You certainly don't let anything as irrational as morals or basic humanity get in your way.]{nl}
 [That's what I mean, you need to grow some claws. The sharper they get, the sooner you can get rid of us. Not that I expect much of you if you do.]{nl}
 Frium's steps came to a halt as they reached a closed door.{nl}He knocked a couple of times and, promptly, the door opened to reveal a simple room containing nothing but a crude table and a few stools, with the Monk Master sitting on one of them.{nl}
 Frium waited for Chridela to enter the room and bow to the Master before silently closing the door and leaving.{nl}[Sit.]{nl}Chridela merely glanced at a stool, hesitating on the Monk Master's order.{nl}
 Olfas Grimm smiled wryly.{nl}[How are you ever going to kill me with all that indecision? If you're sure about it, then take action. It's not like you're lacking in talent...]{nl}
 Chridela took out a stool and sat down without responding.{nl}[Are you not sure if you can kill me? Or are you still trying to hold on to your pride as an old member of the noble class? Hey?]{nl}
 [Enough. Why did you call me here?]{nl}[Right. Well, I was looking everywhere for a nice spot for you, but the opportunity was never there. Class Master vacancies aren't exactly easy to come by, as you know.{nl}
 At the same time, I couldn't just put you into some cleric order or have you learn magic, could I? But now, now I think you might have a real chance at something.]{nl}For the first time, Chridela Otero seemed interested in the Master's words.{nl}
 [Is there a Class Master retiring?]{nl}[It's the Matador Master.]{nl}Chridela was confused.{nl}[But I was never trained in Matador combat. And to be honest, I have no interest in Masters connected to the arena.]{nl}
 [Sure, if you're lucky there could be another empty spot, but if you let it go this could be the last vacancy you'll see in your life. You need to take the chance. Besides, someone of your caliber can learn the Matador style in no time; training won't be a problem.{nl}
 Even judging by your combat skills alone, you're well within the level accepted for Masters of this field. I know you're interested in the position of Fencer Master, but Sorsha Hutton is still young, and very strong. Heck, not even a scandal could bring her down... That's why you need to take this chance.]{nl}
 [What about the students of the current Matador Master? You don't expect them to just accept someone out of nowhere taking their place, do you?]{nl}[Frium and I took care of that. Also, you may not know this, but people close to the Matador Master are actually fond of you. It helps that you're a good-looking woman.{nl}
 As long as you show them that you're good and that you're familiar enough with the Matador techniques, that shouldn't be a problem. Come next year you'll probably be better than all of them, anyway.]{nl}Chridela didn't reply, still pondering on her decision.
 The Monk Master took one look at her and asked,{nl}[Something else on your mind? It's about me, isn't it?]{nl}[I was just thinking about the law that forbids Class Masters from carrying out personal disputes through violence.]{nl}
 Grimm let out a short chuckle.{nl}[Hah. I know what you're thinking. But the Matador Master is a Master of the arena. The same arena I so often visit as the combat enthusiast that I am. You'll have plenty of opportunities, kid.{nl}
 But if you really want to kill me, don't you need to pay me back first? I'm pretty sure you can't do anything to me until your debt is repaid. If I remember correctly, it was that strong determination of yours that made me keep you all this time.]{nl}
 [Five years!]{nl}[What?]{nl}[Five years. You adopted me for five years, so that is how much I owe you. After that, you will have no right to demand anything from me.]{nl}
 [I beg to differ. Aren't you forgetting something? We didn't just support you with food and shelter. We trained you in the finest martial arts and made you into a capable fighter. We settled not only your personal debt, but your family's as well. Not to mention...]{nl}
 [Five years and three favors. That's as much as I'm willing to offer.]{nl}Chridela had raised her voice over the Monk Master's and was now looking directly at him.{nl}
 Olfas Grimm was taken aback by her stare, but he quickly shrugged it off with a cackle.{nl}[Hahah. Alright. You work for us for five years. And you need to complete three missions for me. That's it, after that you're a free woman. I know you're a proud descendant of a noble family, so I trust you to keep your promise.]{nl}
[I will, but that doesn't mean I don't have my limits. For one, you can't force me to protect your life as my last mission.]{nl}[I'm not a fool. I'm only going to demand favors which I know you won't or can't refuse. Be it in the five years that you serve us, or in the three missions you agreed to complete.{nl}
 Besides, I may avoid fighting strong people like you, but I'm no weakling myself. Do I look like a man who's afraid of death? The only reason I haven't died yet is because I have things to do. It's not because I want to live.]{nl}
 [You know what they say about hopeless dreams...]{nl}[You can make fun of me all you want. But the fact is that you still need to prepare for the position of Matador Master. You can start by reading these.]{nl}
 Grimm picked up a pile of books from behind him and dropped them on the table before leaving in silence. Chridela watched him for a moment, but soon turned her attention to the heap of books. She picked one up and turned on a reading lamp.{nl}
 {nl}"The first combat arenas and gladiators date back to around 900 years ago, to the reign of King Melkhiel.{nl}In time, the arenas began to develop, with more and more specialized varieties of gladiator differentiating themselves from their peers."{nl}
 "Then, around 300 ago during the reign of King Freenel, as the Kingdom opened itself up to the exterior, foreign customs and traditions began to permeate the arenas. This lead to the creation of even more new specializations, like the Matadors."{nl}
 "Although battles with animals and demons were already common in arenas around the Kingdom, the Matadors introduced a new style of combat which infused elements of pure spectacle into fierce confrontations with evil beasts."{nl}
 "Evil beasts can be distinguished from demons by their lack of intelligence. While both originate from a demonic realm, evil beasts are equivalent to the animals that exist in our world.{nl}Facing these beasts, especially within the arena, required specialized knowledge and experience in combat techniques that were largely unknown prior to the emergence of the Matadors."{nl}
 "Knowledge of evil beasts first arrived in the Kingdom through an arena manager who collected information from foreign tribal societies. The manager adapted their skills and know-how to his own expertise to design a new style of combat."{nl}
 "His research and practices eventually gave origin to an entirely new profession in the arena. Throughout his life, he continued to polish and add new elements to the technique, until he acquired the official position of Master of the Matador class."{nl}
 "The methods developed by the first Matador were considered highly innovative at the time, due to how they incorporated artistic notions in a style of combat tailored specifically to arena battles performed in front of an audience."{nl}
 "The first big change in the Matador tradition is often pointed out as the time when the original techniques used against evil beasts were expanded and adjusted to include one-on-one confrontations."{nl}
 "Although Matadors were often assisted by other fighters in combat, the need to face demonic beasts solo made it so that, over the course of three centuries, the profession of Matador became more and more specialized in this kind of conflict."{nl}
 "Thus, unlike their predecessors who mastered the art of performing with evil beasts, the Matadors of today are largely recognized by their outstanding command of one-on-one combat."{nl}
 Chridela put down the book and picked up another one. She slowly browsed through the books in the pile one by one before concluding,{nl}[Does he expect me to learn everything by theory? I think I should at least watch some Matador matches tomorrow...]{nl}
 With that, she placed the books in a bag, turned off the light and left.{nl}If she was going to read all night, she may as well do it in the comfort of her own room, Chridela thought.
* Zealot Master Diaries{nl}
 When the funeral processions were over, the nearly 70 people in attendance assembled for a meeting of the Order.{nl} As they were mostly an exclusive group, without close contact with other clerics, there was barely any outsiders in their midst.{nl}
 The family of the deceased were there to fulfill their duties, and those who knew of the events that had occurred were there as well, along with those sent customarily by the lord of the area to document the passing of a Master.{nl}
 They stayed long enough to give their condolences before making a hasty exit and soon enough only the members of the Zealot Order remained.{nl}The only living Zealots of the world were all gathered there.{nl}
 However, there was one person who was a stranger. A person who was not closely related to the order.{nl}His name was Phrevy. A middle-aged man sent by the Inquisitor Master, Thomas Iquinostasys, to witness the proceedings as the Zealot Master's position was now vacant.{nl}
 Not open to outsiders and with little connection to other clergy, if it was not a meeting requiring an official appearance, it was not necessary for those like the Inquisitors to attend.{nl}
 Yet, during this assembly, if the next Zealot Master was selected, it would be Phrevy who would have to verify the process, report back to the Inquisitor Master and later relay the message to the proper department of the Kingdom.{nl} 
 For generations, the Zealot Order would elect their Master and this person would make an appearance before the Inquisitor and other orders of the goddesses for approval before alerting the king. If there was no reason for adjustment the process would be complete.{nl}
 Since it was typical for the Order to elect a new Master before the previous one had either passed away or retired, even if the Inquisitor Phrevy formally knew little about the proceedings, there was really not much to observe. 
 But this time, the assembly had reached a standstill.{nl}Therefore, including the dispatched Phrevy, all who were in attendance were determined that a decision must be reached.{nl}
 Moreover, Phrevy was selected to act as chair for the assembly, thus proving that the friction within the Order was more serious than previously thought.{nl}
 Although the Zealot Order did not consist of many members, they were divided and the span of the Order's history was practically the same as the two sides' lasting conflict. {nl}
 The Zealot Order was founded to recover the missing goddesses. However, the Order had separated into those who wished to seek out Goddess Laima first and those who wished to seek out Goddess Jurate. Both carrying their own opinions and reasoning for the matter.{nl}
 There were those who believed Goddess Dahlia to be of the utmost importance, but compared to the other two groups whose numbers were 30 and 40, they carried no weight and dispersed themselves amongst the others.{nl}The end result being that their opinions on Goddess Dahlia were ignored.{nl}
 Although this discord went on for some time, the Zealot Order was not divided.{nl}As a smaller order, they were aware of their precarious situation.{nl}And, even if the search for one goddess became paramount, they did not turn a blind eye on opportunities to find others.{nl}
 This was because their mission was to find all the Goddesses, not to find a specific one.{nl}What was most important was their role to support the other existing Goddesses, their Orders, and the other Clerics.{nl}
 Although the Zealots were not popular, because their goal was to find the missing goddesses, the other orders did not oppose them. Whether for honor's sake or out of empathy, they could do nothing but help the Zealot Order. 
 Because of this, the Zealots made their conflict known to the others in order to ensure that the matter did not make the already small order be forced to take on even more hardship.{nl}
 At a previous assembly, David Tal, who was from the Laima followers, rose to a seat of power and was elected the Zealot Master.{nl}Those who served Jurate did not complain as, before this assembly, he had married Naomi, the daughter of an influential member of the Jurate followers.{nl}
 For a short time it seemed as though the century old conflict would dissolve thanks to the marriage and David's successful ruling of the Order.{nl}He had gathered the Order's power and prepared them in the direction of finding Goddess Laima.{nl}
 When a single lead appeared, he gathered a small group of Zealots and followed in pursuit.{nl}But the fact that the lead was fruitful is the sorrow of this story.{nl}It was here that David Tal faced his death, as he encountered another group who were in pursuit of Goddess Laima.{nl}
 When David Tal passed away, the Order was stuck with heartache and further separation.{nl}After much backlash, Naomi succeeded her husband and became Zealot Master. However, a heavy atmosphere followed as there were those who followed Laima that believed it was because of Naomi that they lost David.{nl} 
 For many years Naomi ruled and, from pressure within the Order and due to her own personal interests to find her husband's killers, she continued their pursuit for Goddess Laima.{nl}These matters were one and the same and did not need to be pursued separately, yet the result led to her death as she too fell victim to those with connection to her husband's death.{nl}
 (It would be revealed much later, but the one who played the main role behind their deaths was Evoniphon.{nl}Yet this truth would come much later to Aliza Tal, and by then Evoniphon would have had already left this world.){nl}
 It was due to this second death that today's funeral and assembly had taken place.{nl}And the reason for the current emotional divide between those who purse Laima and those who pursue Jurate.{nl}
 There were extremists on one side who believed that if it wasn't for the pressure from those of the Order, Naomi Tal would not have been so reckless, and those on the other side who thought that the very marriage of David and Naomi was the problem.{nl}
 Of course, there were those whose opinions were not as extreme, but it was unclear in which direction the assembly would go as their feelings of grief and resentment had yet to pass.{nl}The Zealot, who requested from Inquisitor Phrevy to speak first, stepped forward.{nl}
 [I believe that the Zealot who has served our order the longest and who carries with them years of experience should be our next Master.]{nl}The person who fit these conditions was a follower of Laima.{nl}Another Zealot requested permission to speak and offered another opinion.{nl}
 [Someone with experience is fine, but a Zealot who is strong and well disciplined would be better. I say this as it would be improper to overlook one who has the skill needed to be the next Master.] 
 This person was from a follower of Jurate. Although it seemed as though neither side had a person they wanted to recommend to speak, a third person requested.{nl}
 [In all our years, we have yet to face a situation where two of our leaders have died and we have not selected another to lead. In this unprecedented moment, I would like to recommend that we consider another approach, different from history, when selecting the next head of the Order.]{nl}
 Here the question of what may that be was raised.{nl}Already prepared, the speaker calmly answered.{nl}[Our Order has set our sights on the task of finding the missing goddesses, but we have yet to succeed. I believe this to be because our Order is too independent and is, without proper reason, filled with pride.]{nl}
 The assembly erupted with cries about other clerics being complacent with the current situation and lazy in comparison.{nl}But after Inquisitor Phrevy quieted them down, the speaker continued.{nl}
 [What you are saying is not wrong. However, receiving even the smallest bit of help from them and the goddesses that they follow would not be bad.] With that said, the speaker continued with a counterargument.{nl}
 [In truth, we have not received an answer from the other goddesses about the whereabouts of Goddess Laima. There are various reasons for this but one, in particular, is that we as humans do not know the whole story. However, we should still be proud of ourselves for the handwork it takes to ask such questions.{nl}
 The other clerics have accepted the work of the goddesses, but it is all of us who feel hurt at their absence. This is why I think it would be acceptable for us to put our faith in the Oracle Master at this time. Is it not possible that in this time of crisis the goddess will show us the way?]{nl}
 An other Zealot addressed the question.{nl}[The goddess knows what is best for us but She will not intervene with our choices. If this was not the case, the goddess would make it known to us who amongst the royals would be the best King.{nl}
 Or better yet, we wouldn't even need a royal family. Finding who amongst us should be king would be a simple task. Just have the goddess provide us with the proper ruler. At this point, why not have the goddess simply sit on the throne Herself and rule?{nl}
 Then we will not even have to worry about the monarch. You have studied our theology. Are you saying that you are unaware of the flaws in this thinking?]{nl}
 [That is correct, however, 200 years ago King Enael was nominated through the Oracle. The king before, King Olukel was the first to step down from the throne due to intervention by the goddess. There are times when these means are necessary.{nl}
 The goddesses from our faith and theology take deep consideration for human will, but this does not mean They will stop it. Let us ask. Let us seek out the Oracle. If we do not receive an answer, we will simply return here.{nl}
 It will take time, but nothing else. If the divine goddess breaks from tradition and intervenes, I doubt that anyone here of the Zealot Order will object to Her decision.]{nl}
 Inquisitor Phrevy, whose role was to judge the decisions of the assembly, examined those before him.{nl}It seemed no one disagreed. Either they all concurred or there were only a few who didn't.{nl}It was at this time that another person requested the floor.{nl}
 It was a young woman who had just come of age.{nl}Aliza Tal, whose mother was the Zealot Master who passed away, and whose father was the Master who passed away the time before, spoke.{nl}
 [I agree that we should speak with the Oracle. But I have one request. I would like us to ask the Oracle, not who should be the next master, but if I, Aliza Tal, would be fit for the role.{nl}
 My brothers and sisters, you have suggested we select one who has years of experience and is well disciplined in our teachings. Although I do not have such qualifications I would like to know.{nl}
 If it is I who is meant to continue my parent's, the previous Master's, dream of unity within the order and recovery of the goddesses.{nl}
 If the prophecy is for me, I will be able to fulfill our goals as I have learned the teachings and thoughts of both sides and within me is the blood of our Order.{nl}
 If my brothers and sisters agree with seeking the Oracle along with my request, and if I receive the goddess' blessing, I will follow the guidance of the prophecy.]{nl}
 The members of the Order nosily spoke amongst themselves.{nl}After their talks had cooled, a few rose from their seats and whispered into the ear of the moderator, Inquisitor Phrevy.{nl}After listening to the opinions of these representatives of the Order, Inquisitor Phrevy began to speak.{nl}
 [All are in agreement to speak with the Goddess through the Oracle Master. The question to be asked will be about the role of Aliza Tal. If there are any Zealots who oppose this decision, speak now.]{nl}He waited, but there was no one who objected.{nl}
 [Good. Then the plan is in motion. If Aliza Tal rejects the prophecy, or the prophecy given does not pertain to her, the task of choosing the next nominee is once again the responsibility of the Zealot Order and we will return to this place again to discuss the matter.{nl}
 We will now bring this assembly to a close and return after receiving the prophecy.] Three days later the Order, to the surprise of the other clerics, received their message through the Oracle Master. 
 The result revealed that Aliza Tal was to become the Zealot Master.{nl} The path ahead for this young Master could be one of honor or one of unbearable hardship. 
 * The Shadow Master's Experiment Journal Part 1{nl}
 Ubik took a deep breath and turned around.{nl}She saw, in the seats provided, the various mage Masters sitting side by side.{nl}Some were apathetic, while others looked on with anticipation.{nl}But regardless of how there Masters felt, Ubik did not want to fail before any of them.{nl}
 With great composure, Ubik signaled towards her students and a monster began to take shape from the shadows.{nl}
  Remembering its name would be a task for another day.{nl}Ubik, knowing it would be a failure to lose focus now, carefully, but with quick precision, completed her casting.{nl}
 The monster's pursuing shadow shot out into four arrows - arrows so sharp they hung like needles.{nl}
 These arrows embedded themselves, one by one, into each of the monster's four feet.{nl}The monster let out a shriek as it found itself pinned to the ground.{nl}
 The shadow crawled from the monster's feet up to its legs threading and separating into separated arrows above and below, crisscrossing around and swiftly piercing the monster's body with sixteen strikes.{nl}
 The shadow then rose above the monster and formed into a gigantic lance and whatever breath was left was taken away with one swift strike that pierced the monster's head.{nl}
 The demonstration complete, Shadowmancer Master Ubik turned to face the various Masters that sat on the platform behind her.{nl}The first to comment was the Sorcerer Master, Dame Circe.{nl}
 [That shadow control is something that can only be seen at the Master's level, no? I think it would be hard for other Shadowmancers to follow. You have gathered too many Masters here to perform a feat that only one of Master level can perform.]{nl}
 Before Ubik could respond with [That little...], Wican Celestic stepped in.{nl}
 [Circe is correct. If it is a skill of this level that other Shadowmancer cannot follow then it is indeed nothing but magically valuable.{nl}
 Also, seeing as how the Sorcerer Master also has a similar skill to reflect a demon's shadow, you may not be able to invoke the amount that she can summon.]{nl}
 While Ubik thought that Wican always agrees with Circe, Winona Ende spoke up.{nl}[But Ubik is not fighting Circe, and not all sorcerer can control demons like Sorcerer Master. It is not completely useless.]{nl}
 This time Ili Teird spoke.{nl}[You are all correct. However, let us move on to the next demonstration. If we continue to discuss after each display, one day will not be enough.]{nl}With that, Ubik turned back around and motioned again to her students, who released a second monster.{nl}
 This time without appearing to move, Ubik pinned the monster to the ground.{nl}And this time Thaumaturge Master Larisa was first to gave her opinion.{nl}
 [Isn't this the normal skill of a Shadowmancer? To pin down an opponent's shadow so that is unable to move? It's a skill that they all know.]{nl}[Correct,] Ubik answered and signaled.{nl}
 Her students began to turn on and off the magic flames that were prepared on all sides. Even during the day the flames were strong and more shadows of the monster appeared. But that was not all.{nl}
 The monster began to be yanked around by the shadows that had just newly formed.{nl}And as it was restrained to its shadow, if the shadow suddenly appeared in another location or drastically changed shape or direction, the body too was forcefully moved to follow suit.{nl}
 Each time the monster hit the ground it received physical damage.{nl}The monster was then dragged into the air and slammed into the hard ground multiple times until the monster was no more.{nl}Ubik turned around again to face the other Master's criticisms.
 This time again Sorcerer Master Circe was the first to speak.{nl}[To fight like this, isn't it a problem to have to prepare lighting every time?]{nl}
 Linker Master Winona Ende Spoke afterward.{nl}[I can use linking technology well, and I can do it without preliminaries if I instantly place a glowing object like a fireball or something of magic every side.{nl}
 This is a technical application for a joint battle with other mages. This might be the original intention.]{nl}Ubik liked that Winona mentioned linkage attacks.{nl}But that did not last long as Psychokino Ili Terid soon said:{nl}
 [But if you're going to give the enemy a physical shock like that, why don't you just do this?]{nl}After saying so, Ili Terid grabbed, with his telekinesis power, the body of the monster that was already dead and he waved it back and forth.{nl}Wican Celestic intervened without hesitation.{nl}
 [Of course if there are times where I cannot get the help of Telekinesis or Psychokino, that would be the situation when I would need this. But it doesn't seem very efficient.]{nl}Sorcerer Master Circe rose from her sit and spoke,{nl}
 [I understand that the Shadowmancer Master has taken Shadowmancer magic to a higher level. But I don't feel as though the other mage Masters necessarily needed to see it. I would like to see more, but sadly I'm too busy. This is all I will watch for today.]{nl}
 With that, Dame Circe along with Wican Celestic said their goodbyes.{nl}The other mage Masters, some of which were interested in the demonstration and wanted to stay, were divided on what to do next.{nl}
 At the time, the quiet Chronomancer Master Lucid Winterspoon rose from her chair.{nl}As she was their elder, the other Masters as well stood up and began to say their goodbyes to Ubik.{nl}
 Although the first to stand, Lucid Winterspoon was the last to approach.{nl}[It seems that my action has caused a  reaction through the others, but that was not my true intention.]{nl}Ubik heard this and spoke,{nl}
 [Was that not what you had intended when you rose from your seat?]{nl}[Yes, there was that. But that was not all. I wanted to speak with you alone.]{nl}Ubik was both excited and worried about what this living legend of magic has to say.{nl}
 Lucid Winterspoon said,{nl}[As a result, of magic you just demonstrated, you were able to send the body of the tied down shadow to another place. If you develop this further you would be able to apply this to teleportation. Have you thought of that?]{nl}
 [But to do that, I will have to solve the problem of physical shock upon arrival. The further the distance the stronger the shock. So of course, you could send the monster a shorter distance and they will not be damaged. But it depends.]{nl}
 Lucid Winterspoon grinned at hearing those words and said,{nl}[If that was the only problem, then in comparison it would be easily solvable.]{nl}Ubik thought for a moment and replied,{nl}
 [Plus, another problem is, if you want to send the shadow further, one will need stronger lighting as well. And lights need to be installed the further the location. Plus if the body isn't there, there is no way to send the shadow of that body first.]{nl}
 [Then what if you do not use your own shadow. What if you used the shadow of something else?]{nl}
 [I've never considered that so I'm not sure if it is possible. I would have to come to that conclusion through research, no? To send my shadow or to send the shadow of someone else, the problem is still the same as the one before.{nl}
 Without a way to call on stronger lights and the shadow first, the body will still need to go to the place to reach the shadows.]{nl}Lucid Winterspoon grinned again and said,{nl}
 [And if that shadow was the moon's?]{nl}At those words, Ubik's expression changed.{nl}[That's genius! If you can utilize the shadow of the solar or lunar eclipse then one can call upon it from anywhere. I hadn't thought of that.]
 Lucid Winterspoon spoke again.{nl}[Well, try. Teleportation has been considered inefficient but until trying, you won't know. How would you feel about researching this type of magic? I will be able to help you from time to time.]{nl}
 [Yes, why not? I will start from today. Thank you so much. This is an amazing idea, Master Lucid.]{nl}And from that day forward, the Shadowmancer Master was known as Eclipse Ubik.
 * Winter Flint{nl}
 A mansion, dating back centuries, had been overtaken by a melancholy mood that matched its aging years. {nl}Yet, it was not always like that.{nl}Just a few weeks ago, the mansion glowed with the prestige it had gathered over the years and the atmosphere not so heavy.{nl}
 But, the actions of a certain someone led to a family meeting being held in a mood so somber that it affected not only the disposition of the mansion but the extended family as well.{nl}Walking down a corridor of this mansion, in the direction of the meeting, were two men and one woman.{nl}
 Of these three people, the one to the far right, Vaidotas Winterspoon, addressed the man walking to his left.{nl}[I did wrong. I will not do so again in the future. That is what you will say. Understood? Don't speak of anything else.]{nl}
 The woman interjected. [But, why must our Flint apologize? And you, Vaidotas, are being quite annoying.]{nl}[You are the annoying one, Lucienne. Do you then think it's alright for Flint to be punished?]{nl}[What did he do that this is the case?{nl}
 [I also think he did nothing wrong. But if it's all so simple, why have the elders gone so far as to hold a family meeting?]{nl}[For the elders to feel the need to do so, shows how old fashioned they are. If Flint inherits the head of the household our family will have to change as well.]{nl}
 [It's important that he first endures today's meeting before considering his inheritance.]{nl}Although Flint was carefully listening to the words of his cousins, he did not speak.{nl} It was not that he refused to answer, but rather he had yet to decide what it was that he would do.{nl}
 Whether they were aware of this or not, Vaidotas and Lucienne continued their debate until the three of them arrived at the doors of the meeting.{nl}Just before opening the door, Vaidotas stressed his previous thoughts onto Flint one final time.{nl}
 The door, now opened, revealed dozens of men and women sitting inside the hall.{nl} A look around and one would note a single, remote chair that was prepared as though its future occupant was to face trial or interrogation. To the front and at an angle on either side of this chair, the men and women waited.{nl}
 Vaidotas and Lucienne took their seats in their respective places.{nl}And, without a word, Flint Winterspoon, the man who had followed them both, took his place at the center in the lone chair.{nl}
 However you viewed it, this event was for him. Although his seat seemed that of a criminal on trial, he was today's main protagonist.{nl}In other words, today these people would judge if he would be a hero or a villain. {nl}From that perspective, you could say he was less like a criminal waiting trial and more like an actor awaiting the reviews of the audience.{nl}
 Now there was but one place of honor that remained empty.{nl}If this place was also filled then the hall would seat 33.{nl}However, if one excludes the man sitting in the place of the defendant, there were only 31 people sitting around him, staring him down.{nl}
 An elderly man, sitting to the right of the empty place of honor, opened his mouth to speak. {nl}[With this, the current members of the Winterspoon family who have completed the rite of passage, for the exception of one, have all gathered here today. In place of our vacant Patriarch, I will take the role of eldest and announce the start of the 817th Family Meeting.]{nl}
 He paused slightly before continuing.{nl}[Kohath Winterspoon you have requested the right to speak and thus, you may go first.]{nl}To his right, a man sitting in the center of the group rose, bowed his head towards the rest of the family in greeting, and spoke.{nl}
 [This meeting was originally intended to be a joyful one to fill the vacancy of the Patriarch in the family. However, it is unfortunate that one of our members, who was a strong candidate for such a position, has been suspected of violating the family law and the rules of the alchemists. This meeting now serves as an investigation.{nl}
 Our family has been regarded for centuries as the most prestigious in the kingdom and the very founders of alchemy.]{nl}
 Kohath took a breath, then spoke on. {nl}One. An Alchemist's research and results will not interfere with the divine providence of the Goddesses.{nl}Two. An Alchemist's research and results will not bring harm to the Goddesses.{nl}
 Three. An Alchemist will never use the Goddesses or humans as raw material.{nl}All Alchemist will seek to follow the aforementioned provisions and will work to ensure others do as well. {nl}As you know, as a member of this family, these are the first sentences you learn and last that you keep until the day you die.{nl}
 Yet, it seems that Flint Winterspoon has allowed these rules to slip his mind. He hopes to use alchemy to craft more powerful weapons. If we begin to use the skills and capability of our family to create such things, what sort of issues will arise?{nl}
 What sort of horrible place will our world become if these weapons exist? I judge that we stop this type of research and experimentation. There is not one person in the history of the Winterspoon family who has directly used alchemy to develop weapons.{nl}
 No, even more, no one has spared the thought. And to come here and hear that the person who will be inheriting the family hopes to use alchemy as a foundation to create weapons cannot be ignored.]{nl}When he was done, a young man raised his hand and asked for permission to address the family.{nl}The elderly man gave such permission with his eyes, and the younger one began.{nl}
 It was Vaidotas Winterspoon. {nl}[What was just said does not match the truth. Cheminis Sword, Vine Equipment, Riena Equipment and more were all created by our family or were provided for by our skill. With these weapons we have made great contributions to the kingdom by saving many lives.{nl}
 If we consider this example, and continue to think that making weapons with alchemy is a problem then this would lead to the absurd thinking that all blacksmiths and weapon makers in our world are killers who do not know the sanctity of life.]{nl}
 Although a select few nodded at Vaidotas words, Kohath did not stand down.{nl}[Do you think I don't know that? My nephew knows of only one thing and speaks unknowingly of the second. Do you know how long ago gun powder was invented?{nl}
 During the time of Sosel the 2nd, our family created gun power, yet as time passed, as powerful as it may be, gun power based weapons did not become the norm. Even the majority of the Kingdom's soldiers use spears and swords. Have you considered why?{nl}
 But before Vaidotas could retort, another person raised their hand.{nl}This time it was Lucienne Winterspoon. {nl}With permission, she began to speak.{nl}
 [Nonetheless, the Royal Army does use Sappers and Cannons. The reason why the Kingdom tends not to use gun power is because they are already using weapons founded in magic and divine energy that are just as good as gun powder.{nl}
 But this doesn't mean that gun power is weak. Guns and swords are all just weapons. Our family applied alchemy to swords and spears, so there is no reason for us not to do the same with gun powder based weapons.{nl}
 It is our family that has developed gun power and we should consider it time to develop it further, Father.]{nl}And with grace Lucienne Winterspoon ended her appeal.{nl}
 But Kohath words were harsh.{nl}[I have failed as my daughter’s teacher. From the time of Sosel the 2nd for thousands of years, you think that various patriarchs have not thought of applying such research because of a lack of curiosity or ability? It was through wisdom and discretion that they began to realize the dangers.]{nl}
 Before either Lucienne or Vaidotas could recover permission to speak, the doors flew open and a single person walked in. Although not a usual attendant of such meeting, it was for this person that the highest chair of honor was left vacant.{nl}
 And though not many were used to seeing her, all members of the family knew her face.{nl}It was not a face easy to forget even if seen only once over several decades. {nl}Time had passed and yet her features had not changed at all, making her all the more recognizable.{nl}
 When she entered the room, the other members of the family rose from their seats and bowed their heads in reverence of the eldest member.{nl}And as she walked, she began to speak.{nl}
 [Although I have attended great meetings, it has been awhile since I've attended one where the moment it opens a debate has already started.]{nl}The elderly man who was acting representative addressed her.{nl}[It has been awhile, Great Aunt.]{nl}The woman, Lucid Winterspoon casually nodded her head and disappeared.{nl}
 Reappearing in the vacant chair high above.{nl}[As time went by I grew tired of being called Grandmother, Great Grandmother, Great-Great-Grandmother and asked to go by Great Aunt, but Kenaz, we are both old and to hear you call me that has put me off.]{nl}
 Lucid Winterspoon took her seat and the rest if the family followed suit.{nl}As Kenaz Winterspoon considered what to say, Lucid stopped him.{nl}[In the time it took to approach this chair I saw all that had occurred here. You do not need to explain it to me.]{nl}
 With that said, Lucid turned her attention to the man sitting in the defendant's chair, Flint Winterspoon.{nl}[It is not clear if pausing a heated discussion is the best idea,{nl} 
 but if the opinions differ so much as to start a fight and where opposing opinions could lead to further misunderstandings, the discussion must be put to rest. And I think that time has come.]{nl}
 After speaking, Lucid took a moment to examine the other members one by one. She saw in them the descendants of her brothers and sisters who had long passed away centuries ago. Then spoke again.{nl}
 [Although, I would like us to share our thoughts and wisdom to work towards an appropriate conclusion, I know that the truth is that we do not have the time.]{nl}
 The elder man, Kenaz Winterspoon, who was acting speaker, spoke.{nl}[Great Aunt, as observer of time and eldest of us all, if you say as such then it is fine. However, we are aware that you often separate yourself from the events of the family and even that of the outside world, but{nl} 
 sometimes there are times where you do interfere and only afterwards do we understand why. If there is a patriarch that you wish to chose, then we will trust your wisdom and gather together to prepare for such a person.{nl} 
 No matter who is selected by you, we will not refuse them.]{nl}[My answer does not bear with it wisdom of such expectation. And more importantly, it is not the wisdom of the decision that is important, but the effort set to reach the intended result.{nl}
 Regrettably, time is short. Which is why I have given you the task of presiding over these assemblies.]{nl}[Speak.]{nl}Kenaz replied, but Lucid Winterspoon directed her next question towards Flint.{nl}
 [This whole time, we still have not asked you of your opinion. Hearing the opinion of the others is important, but first we must hear from you. What are your thoughts? Do you wish to use alchemy to develop these powerful bullets and sell them?]{nl}
 Flint Winterspoon, shocked by the appearance of a famous family member he had only heard stories about, was at a loss for words.{nl}As such, Lucid Winterspoon waited quietly for the answer and this was the result.{nl}
 The time to personally meet Lucid Winterspoon and greet her or ask her questions had already passed, and as such his reply was short.{nl}[I would prefer if it was not summarized in that way, but your summary is not wrong. Great Aunt.]{nl}
 Lucid Winterspoon turned back to the whole assembly{nl}[For the exception of a few, the majority of the family members here oppose this thought. I, for one, think that working on something again with alchemy that I have left untouched for the last 100 years would bring exciting developments...]{nl}
 Kohath Winterspoon's mouth fell open and a weak indignant voice escaped his lips.{nl}[Great Aunt!]{nl}
 But Lucid Winterspoon silenced him with a wave of her finger.{nl}[This is not the time to get excited, my boy. I simply mean that I do not wish to deal with the family's work here and there. And I am past the age of being able to do such exciting experiments...{nl}
 She stopped and after a long paused continued again.{nl}[I understand that this is not the opinion you would like to hear. But if anyone shares a different one then feel free to speak. But right now, I will ask Flint. The work you would like to do, can you complete it with the help of our family?]{nl}
 Flint's expression changed.{nl}It was because he had never let the thought cross his mind.{nl}Lucienne and Vaidotas, who were sitting amongst the family, shared a look over this exciting prospect and waited for Flint's response with anticipation.{nl}
 The other family members as well shared a similar anticipation as they stared at Flint.{nl} His concerns were many, but time was short and the answer he had for himself was ever more so.{nl}Thus his answer came easy.{nl}
 [Of course not. I would not need to focus on the Winterspoon's family power or influence. But, the problem remains that I will not be using my skills for the family.]{nl}
 [If that is the case, why do you feel the need to convince them? If you have no interest in the patriarch seat, can't you simply go and do the work you wish? If you feel frustrated and unable to use your talents within the family, then leave. The family will not collapse without you.{nl}
 I know this because I, too, have done nothing to contribute to the family for centuries.]{nl}Kohath and a few others wished to protest but,{nl} 
 the family, for centuries, faced no problems with the absence of Lucid's alchemy and there was no evidence to support the opinion that removing Flint would suddenly cause problems.{nl}
 But Flint was still shocked by the idea of leaving the family, a thought that had never occurred to him. But as he thought about it the more the idea was to his liking.{nl}When Lucid Winterspoon saw this change she was prompted to speak.{nl}
 [If Flint leaves the family, then whatever work he does we have no reason to interfere. However, we cannot ignore the fact that the foundation of Flint's work is our own teachings.{nl}
 So, if you carry the Winterspoon name you cannot complete the work you would like to do. Whatever comes next will be difficult, and ending your connection with the family will also bring challenges, so in the future go by the name, Winterwood.{nl}
 I ask that you use this name as a guide to remember to walk the path between what you have learned from the family and what you hope to do in your own work.]{nl}
 Kohath spoke.{nl}[Saying he will leave the family does not excuse him from the rules of alchemy. It is not just our family but all Alchemists in the Kingdom -- no the world who must adhere to these immutable principles.]{nl}
 Lucid Winterspoon replied.{nl}[I know your worries. But Flint is not the type of person to use what he has learned with reckless abandonment. You too already know this, no? And I also believe that in the long-term this work will be good for the family and for the advancement of our world.{nl}
 Have you forgotten that I am a Chronomancer? And if you would like to discuss the rules of alchemy, it was I who was at the center of its creation. Forget the thought that you can tie me down using the fear of these principles.]{nl}
 Kenaz, not waiting to miss the opportunity to keep the rarely seen Lucid Winterspoon involved with the family, spoke.{nl}[If it pleases you, how about also recommending the next head of the family? Just mention a promising person to be patriarch and you can go your way.]{nl}
 If the person Lucid picks does become the next patriarch, and Lucid is there to help them the success of the family would be even greater.{nl}If one considers the generations of patriarchs who had begged Lucid earnestly for a single shred of advice, this was an opportunity the family could not let slip by.{nl}
 [You should pick a person from the next generation. Vaidotas would do well. The family elders will help to guide the younger Patriarch...]{nl}Kohath who was ignoring Kenaz's gaze had a need to object this time too.{nl}
 [Vaidotas' alchemist abilities are fine. But he does not share the same strength as Flint. He is but a scholar. And, as you know, to be the patriarch you need to have a certain level of fighting skill as well.]{nl}
 On hearing this, Kenaz realized that Kohath was not opposed to Vaidotas as leader but rather wanted to restrain Lucid to the role of looking after a weaker patriarch.{nl}To ensure what this is what was said, Lucid Winterspoon spoke first.{nl}
 [Since he is still young we can prepare him for the title and develop areas where is he lacking. If you feel anxious, we can send him to train. In fact, let us do this.{nl}
 Recently, the Swordsman Master gave up his public office and retired to Klaipeda. Let us send Vaidotas to Klaipeda to receive his guidance.]{nl}The elder, Kenaz, spoke.{nl} 
 [Learning how to fight like a warrior isn't bad, but don't you think, if it is possible, learning how to fight as a Wizard from you, Great Aunt, would be simpler?]{nl}
 [The Wizard Society would be in an uproar if I trained him. It would be seen as favoritism and I will still need to be responsible for the work I am supposed to do. Send him south.{nl} 
 Let him experience the Great Woodlands and other areas, and along the way I will teach him about the climate of each region and their special materials. It has been hundreds of years since I've trained someone in alchemy. But I will yield this amount. In this case you will arrive to Klaipeda a bit late, but warrior training needs not to be rushed.]{nl}
 At this, Lucid stopped and closed her eyes for a moment.{nl}‘No…if our family’s members try to save this world, even just a small step it will prove difficult. We will have to match the time…{nl}
 We cannot be too strong, nor weak, we must match the moment perfectly… It doesn’t need to be Vaidotas, but there is also no reason not to. As long as it does not interfere with the providence and expectations of the Goddesses, it will be okay…’{nl}And like that the thought disappeared.{nl}
 Of course, she could not share her thinking with the others.{nl}Instead, she turned to Flint and spoke.{nl}[You have given up the burden of Patriarch, but there is other work you must bear.{nl}
 I will pray that the honor of the goddesses be revealed through you. You still retain half of the family name and for that you must carry our reputation with you.]{nl}
 This frustrated Flint.{nl}[If someone else has said that I would not have found it so strange, but from you Great Aunt, I do not know.]{nl}At that accusation, Lucid replied.{nl}[Oh? But it is like that, no? Even if we go our separate ways, no matter how far we go, we cannot be fully apart.]{nl}
 When those words were spoken, Lucid Winterspoon, without a single goodbye began to disappear.{nl}The remaining family members, who were used to this behavior, sent her off by bowing their heads.{nl}
 Although they did not have the ability to see as far into the future as Lucid, they could feel that this was the start of a new era.{nl}However, not one of them remaining there knew how difficult this new era would be.

I'm upset, but more so I'm sorry that we were fooled by such a trick.{nl}Savior, please take these gifts as a token of apology and gratitude.{nl}
Savior, you've already found a stone plate for today.{nl}Tomorrow, I will inform you when I learn of its new location.
Savior, it is because of you that all of the stone plates have been found.{nl}Thank you.
There seems to be something here. Dig it out?
I will tell you the location of the stone plate.{nl}
The special reward has to be retrieved within the deadline. Please see our official website for more information.
You have not retrieved any stone plates yet.
The match has ended 
The match has come to an end, do you wish to leave? 
Will you take part in the penalty shoot-out challenge? 
Come, tell me the results.
I never knew this function existed...{nl}How did you find out about it?
If you bring me about 100 Strawberries and 100 Red Meduja Essences I can make you the best strawberry cupcake for your offering.
Exorcist Master 
Before, all you needed was unyielding faith and a healthy body to protect yourself from evil spirits.{nl}Yet now that these forces have become more violent since Medzio Diena, even the strongest stand no chance.
You wish to become an Exorcist...{nl}We, Exorcists, are different from Warlocks in that our task is to use the Goddesses' strength to exorcise these evil spirits.
As you will need to come face-to-face with such beings, the path to become an Exorcist is far from easy.{nl}Even if you do become one, you will be fighting against impossible odds with no end.
Knowing this, do you still wish to become an Exorcist? 
Understood.{nl}It takes time to train an Exorcist properly.{nl}As such, since Medzio Diena, the number of Exorcists available to combat the rise of the evil forces is few.
As such, in order to speed up the process, only those who can exorcise an evil spirit can be recruited.{nl}You will need three high-ranked Clerics to vouch for your ability.
First, gain the approval of the Krivis Master, the Priest Master, and the Inquisitor Master.
After receiving their approval, return here to study and be tested on Exorcist theory.{nl}And lastly, you will need to perform an exorcism from start to finish by distinguishing whether a person is possessed or not.
If you succeed in all of these tests, you can become an Exorcist.
Becoming an Exorcist is not a simple task.
You want my approval to become an Exorcist?{nl}You've chosen a difficult path.
Place Goods for Offering before the Goddess Statues in Mochia Forest, Manahas, Forest of Prayer, Penitence Route of Cathedral, and Rasvoy Lake – then pray.{nl}Do this and return here, and I will approve you for the Exorcist test.
Go to Mochia Forest, Manahas, Forest of Prayer, Penitence Route of Cathedral, and Rasvoy Lake.{nl}Deliver to the Goddess Statues Goods for Offering and pray.{nl}If you do this I will then approve you for the Exorcist test.
You have given offerings and have prayed to the statues. You now have my approval for taking the Exorcist test.
We need Exorcists to eradicate the evil spirits and the demons that have risen since Medzio Diena.{nl}However, first and foremost, we as Clerics are meant to heal those who have been hurt.
I would like you to make this medicine and deliver it to Commander Julian in Dvasia Peak.
I would like you to make this medicine and deliver it to Commander Julian in Dvasia Peak.
You've delivered the medicine.{nl}I will give you my approval to become an Exorcist.{nl}Just promise that, as an exorcist, you will fight against evil to save the helpless.
This medicine is for us?
{nl}The soldiers have become demoralized due to our slow progress towards the Gateway of the Great King.{nl}And our shortage of medicine had us worried.{nl}However, thanks to your delivery, my fears are somewhat alleviated.
So you want to be an Exorcist?
Subduing evil spirits is not the only task for an Exorcist.{nl}You must show them and those they have possessed the authority of the Goddesses.{nl}From time to time, these spirits can bury into our souls and weaken our belief.
Because of this you must save those who have fallen prey. And for that, you will need pure belief and conviction in the Goddesses.{nl}Do you have it in you?
There is no hesitation in your stance, but...{nl}I worry you will not stand this firm when the time comes to face them.
But my judgements can be hasty.{nl}All I ask is that you maintain this strength during the test.
I see.{nl}Well, if that's the case I cannot challenge your decision to take the Exorcist test. 
Come again when your faith and conviction is unshakable.
You've received the approval of the Krivis, Priest, and the Inquisitor Masters.{nl}Good. We will now begin the Exorcist test.
I will give you a few books.{nl}Read them and select the correct answer to my questions.{nl}Come back after you've read the books carefully.
The History of Exorcism Volume 1
The History of Exorcism
Preface{nl}Clerics have always been careful to record the histories of faith and theology. However, there are certain fields where the historical and theological achievements have not been made known to the public despite their documentation.
One such case is that of the Exorcists, which shall be discussed here.{nl}In truth, the history of the Exorcists, along with their theoretical achievements attained through the practice of exorcism and the development of such skills, are not material fit for the general public.
In addition, it is inevitable that these records contain the personal information of victims both saved and lost through exorcism.{nl}These documents have been classified for the reason that the disclosure of such information is an infringement of the victims' personal rights.{nl}The confidentiality of the documents is difficult to object, as breaching the personal rights of victims is not justifiable in any case.
Apart from the historical records and research achievements already kept by other Clerics, it is imperative that I, as the Sage Master, record all that I know for the sake of practicality and public benefit.
To fulfill this role, I will now briefly discuss the world of Exorcists, detailing their techniques and rituals, even if it means that I must alter the names of the locations and the people involved.
It was fortunate of us to have had the approval of the Kingdom's bureaucracies in recording the actual names of the locations and people involved for historical accuracy, but most names of those involved have been altered.{nl}Do take heed that any similarities or any assumptions you may draw about the recorded events are most likely to be far from the truth.
In the cases where one may have correctly guessed the true names of the locations and people involved, bear in mind that it is best to keep these conjectures to oneself out of politeness and decency.
Lastly, I advise you – it is best not to disgrace yourself by publicizing these speculations and bringing them before the King's court with the intention of undermining their honor.
Year 1020 of the Kingdom under the 2nd year of the Reign of Domipel, Sage Master Kelemborer Martial
Origins of the Exorcist
It was during the reign of Lomel II that Exorcists first gained official recognition.
Many Clerics had dabbled in exorcism before that, but the Order of the Exorcists was established during the time in which Lomel II facilitated the organization of the many orders and denominations of Clerics.
From then on, only those sanctioned by the court were recognized as Exorcists and were allowed to perform exorcisms.{nl}The Clerics, regardless of their sincerity or rank, were forbidden from practicing the art.
With these clear boundaries in place, the Exorcists were able to build upon their experiences and accumulate their knowledge.
The History of Exorcism Book 2
The Early History of Exorcism
The early history of exorcism began with the discovery of possessions and their treatment.{nl}The first phase involves distinguishing those that are possessed from those who feign it. The early Exorcists were required to firmly establish a process for discernment.
These methods of discernment were established early in the Exorcists' history from their collective experiences obtained through trial-and-error and shared within their circle by word of mouth, their secrets guarded from the general public.
Now comes the second phase.{nl}The treatment of the possessed differs greatly depending on the nature of the perpetrator, whether it be a demon, an evil spirit or simply a ghost.{nl}There are also different types of possessions – the demon could simply possess the victim, just hold them captive, damage the victim mentally and leave for good or visit the victim regularly to do them harm.
Also, as clergymen, Exorcists have the responsibility not only in exorcising a demon or a spirit but also in healing those that have been victimized by a possession.{nl}So it was necessary for early Exorcists to have undergone training as a Cleric as well.{nl}All the more, if one had the abilities as a healer, one could be trained as an Exorcist without training as a Cleric or a Plague Doctor.
While caring for victims had been a crucial part of being an Exorcist in the early days, such practices soon lost their importance as the types of demons and the cases of possession grew drastically in number.
In conclusion, the duties of the Exorcists shifted towards the offensive because of the need for a stronger offensive against the demon forces, and they have come to open their doors to Clerics to assist in the healing of the victims as of late.
On the Nature of Possessions: Ghosts, Demons, and Evil Spirits
Once it is determined that the victim is not feigning possession or just suffering from mental illness, the next important step is to diagnose what is possessing the victim.
There are four causes for possessions.{nl}The last of the four causes does not need to be mentioned here, so the three main causes would be demons, ghosts and evil spirits.
An evil spirit, in the case of possessions, refers not to a ghost but a specific type of ghosts that have joined the demonic forces.{nl}Therefore the word ghost, in this specific text, refers to a wandering soul of a deceased person that has no relations to a demon.
In addition, when speaking of demons we mean, of course, those who have originated from the demonic world.
From the early days of the Exorcists, the difficulty of the exorcism was as follows: Demons > Evil Spirits > Ghosts.{nl}It is only natural that demons, regardless of rank, were more powerful than a ghost or a demonic spirit, and the experiences of the Exorcists in the field did not contradict this view, allowing it to be the standard for some time.
Many years passed, then something happened that completely turned this order of difficulty upside down.{nl}A capable priest, whose name has been withheld by the Exorcist Order, was performing an Exorcism on a possession that she had correctly identified as demon.{nl}She discovered that demons would withdraw from their victims when she stated that the demon's possession was threatening the life of the one possessed. When this approach was proved to be effective for all demonic possessions, the exorcism of demons became a much easier task.
Since the discovery, the difficulty levels in exorcism shifted as such: Evil Spirits > Ghosts > Demons.{nl}It may be strange that evil spirits are more difficult to deal with than ghosts despite their ties to the demonic forces.{nl}Evil spirits were more powerful than ghosts because of their demonic ties and, unlike actual demons, would not retreat from their victims when correctly identified by the Exorcist.
As there were no further developments, Exorcists had to be satisfied that at least one case of possession, that of the demons, had become easier to handle.{nl}And though they had discovered this new exorcism method that made the older methods obsolete, the Exorcist Order could not fundamentally understand how and why it worked.
One could guess that this is because of some relationship between the Goddesses and demons that we humans do not understand. But because of the secrecy of the Exorcist Order, which is on par with that of the Zealots, it is difficult to speculate further.
The History of Exorcism Book 3
New Discoveries in Possessions: Divine Spirit and Miko
In addition to the three causes for possessions – Demon, Evil Spirit, and Ghost – there is also a fourth that has only recently come to the attention of the Exorcists.
Because of this, it is possible that failed cases Exorcists had previously recorded as incurable or ambiguous were such instances.
In conclusion, this new aggressor is what the Miko call Divine Spirits.{nl}However, it is rare for such spirits to possess humans and even rarer for when they do for them to cause harm.{nl}It is even more uncommon for them to purposely cause harm out of malicious intents.
To emphasize this point further, one must discern the nature of the spirit and see if they have in fact intentionally possessed a human. Usually, if it is not by accident or through human ignorance that the event has occurred, it's possible that the victim may have previously done harm to the attacking spirit. Or that the possessor is actually evil.
It is very rare that a divine spirit will intentionally harm a human.{nl}However, there are cases where this has happened and if a time comes to write about them, I will.
These facts have been found through research, and accurate theoretical truth has been established thanks to communication between the Miko and the societies of the Kingdom.
After these times, the Exorcists have passed on the responsibility for such cases to the Miko if it involves a divine spirit.{nl}Unlike possessions done by a demon, evil spirit, or ghost, even a powerful Exorcist using the divine power of the Goddesses cannot expel a divine spirit without using excessive force. However, with the appearance of the Miko, new methods have been developed.
In cases where a Miko is too far away to provide help or due to certain circumstances is unable to, the Exorcist can still use their superior psychic strength.{nl}One could say they are a healer engaging in a field that is not their profession.
Exorcists do not speak publicly, and recently this has become even more the case since the Miko Master has taken office. The reason for such behavior is unknown. (Originally written by the previous Sage Master, it as been corrected to include Information about the Divine Spirits and the Miko. 1093 Year of the Kingdom - Lufas Kehel)
The History of Exorcism Book 4
Exorcist Private Documents
By order from the Inquisitor Master, in accordance to the law of the Kingdom and those of the religious orders, the following documents are classified and are only available to Exorcists or those seeking to become Exorcist as deemed so by the Exorcist Master. 
Regardless of one's status in the Kingdom or rank in the Order, those who violate this order shall be punished.{nl}The authorization to read this document is limited to the King, the Exorcist Master, and the Inquisitor Master.
Disclosing the contents of this document will also result in punishment.{nl}In addition, if there is an Exorcist engaging in work where knowing the content of these documents is deemed unnecessary, it is unnecessary to release the details and keeping them a secret is fine as this was the case for many Exorcists in the past.
A Shift in the Nature of the Exorcist: Fighting Demons
You may come to understand by observing modern Exorcists that their most distinctive feature is not their exorcisms or their healing abilities, but rather, their strong fighting advantage against demons.
The Kingdom has always protected its people utilizing help from the divine Goddesses, talented Wizards, Clerics, and soldiers.{nl}And, one would think, in order to have leverage over demons, the societies of the Kingdom would also call upon the Exorcists to engage in battle.
However, in the Kingdom's history, Exorcists were often absent from such conflicts.{nl}In fact, Exorcists still gained the power to be of great assistance even without engaging.
One may think of this as a contradiction, just as when a healer, who has not treated any patients, still displays extraordinary clinical experience.
How the Exorcists achieved such ability to fight against demons, despite insufficient training, has to do with a secret agreement between the Goddesses and the demons.
The few clerics to become aware of this agreement learned about it through exorcism.{nl}They were able to identify the agreement due to a successful exorcism where the demon fled after being told it was harming the human it possessed. After researching the implications of such action, the agreement came to light.
To this day, it is still unclear as to why the Goddess and the demons have such an arrangement, but the effect is clear in the ease in which demons can now be exorcised.
It can be inferred from this development, that the Goddesses' formed an agreement with the demons with the intention of protecting us humans.
With that in mind, questioning or even misinterpreting their intentions is deemed inappropriate for a cleric. The important part is the result.{nl}This result is that those demons who, regardless of intention, wish to violate the Goddess-demon agreement and cause harm in our world can easily be punished by humans.
As Exorcists have been given the responsibility to deal with such matters, they have naturally gained superiority in combat against demons.{nl}Through their progress, they have provided valuable information about demons to the Sorcerers, Warlocks, Zealots, and other classes. And they have even provided materials, such as the occasional demon parts and cadavers, for experiments.
As a result, although it has only been recently that this agreement has come to light, Exorcists have contributed to keeping it alive by secretly ridding our world of those demons who wish to trespass it.
Take the time to carefully read the books on exorcism I gave to you.
It seems that you have finished studying.{nl}Now then, I shall test your knowledge of Exorcist theory.
It was Lomel II who propagated the organization of the Clerics' denominations.{nl}And the Exorcists were soon established as a part of the clergy.{nl}Can you tell me who were the people that were allowed to practice exorcisms and its related rituals at this point in history?
What is the proper way to deal with a divine spirit that is causing harm to a human?
Of the following, select all entities that can cause a possession.
What are evil spirits? 
You have studied the books well.{nl}You have passed the test.{nl}But I warn you, your next trial won't be as easy and is far more dangerous. 
Now you must steel your nerves.
Your knowledge of theory leaves much to be desired.{nl}Study a bit more.
We must now check if you are able to properly identify a possession.{nl}In a moment, a man will arrive who is claiming that he was forced to steal because he was possessed by an evil spirit.
You must decide for yourself whether he is truly possessed or not.
The man's name is Gintaras. Try interrogating him and come back to tell me whether you think he is truly possessed or not.
Gintaras
I did nothing wrong.{nl}The evil spirit inside of me forced me to do it.
If I was possessed, then I would have a fever?{nl}I can't tell if it's a fever or not but...{nl}Haha...
That's right.{nl}Can't you smell this awful stench?{nl}I can't bare it and I was worried it would cause problems for those around me.
I've heard some possessions don't give off such a smell, how unlucky am I...
You think that I purposely rubbed garbage on myself?{nl}That doesn't make any sense at all.{nl}I... I would never do such a thing.
Yes, that is correct.
At times I find myself soaking wet and at other times I was seen loitering near the Goddess Statue.
Ah...{nl}Did I really say that?
I can't remember a thing and the person who saw me may have been mistaken... 
What is that?{nl}Yikes!
It's so painful.{nl}Please release me from this pain.
Is that so?{nl}Maybe I reacted that way because I'm a bit sensitive to cold.
Did you say Gintaras is not a victim of possession?
You are correct.{nl}He has only feigning his possession to get himself out of trouble.
I really am possessed.{nl}I think I'm about to faint.{nl}Please exorcise me before the evil spirit takes over again.
Report to the Exorcist Master that Gintaras is not really possessed.
There has never been a case where a possession victim has not suffered from fever, so he is suspicious.
The possessed smell of a rotting corpse, not garbage.
Evil spirits cannot approach a Goddess Statue. He is suspicious.
He is surely not possessed because of his reaction to water.
There is a married couple who lives in the Spring Light Woods.{nl}The wife reported that she suspects her husband is possessed because he frequently suffers from a fever and memory loss.
Give the couple a visit and try to tell whether the husband is truly possessed or not.
Go to the Spring Light Woods and see if the husband is truly possessed or not.
Sygitas
I'm afraid that evil spirits might be possessing my body.{nl}What am I to do?
My body is always hot as fire from the fever.
Fevers are not a continual symptom in the case of possessions.
I sweat a lot because of the fever.{nl}I need to change frequently because of the smell of sweat.
The possessed smell like rotting corpses, not sweat.
When the fever gets too high I often collapse and suffer from memory loss.
The possessed do not have memory of the time they are possessed, but there have been no reports of victims collapsing.
Whoa... It's freezing...
He doesn't seem to have the same reaction that most victims have to water.
There isn't enough evidence to tell if he is possessed or not. Let's investigate further.
Rimanta
What am I to do if my husband is possessed by an evil spirit?{nl}I am sick with worry.
His fever wasn't this bad just a few days ago.{nl}At first I thought he was sick so I got him some medicine.
But the medicine only seemed to make the fever worse and he started fainting despite all the different medicine we've tried.
His fever doesn't seem as serious as the fever the possessed suffer from.
He sweats profusely because of his fever.{nl}So I have to change his clothes and sheets all the time because of the smell of sweat.
It seems that he reeks of sweat and not rotting corpses.
He collapses and starts speaking in tongues when his fever gets too high.
Check to see if he shows other symptoms than speaking in tongues.
I wake him up when he does that but he doesn't seem to remember it at all.
I didn't notice anything else about his behavior, just his gibberish.
There seem to be no other symptoms.
It may be just a fever. Let's investigate further.
There are some food supplies in the box but they look spoilt.
The water smells funny.
There's some noxious smelling liquor in the barrel. 
It may be that he is just sick from eating spoilt food.
Do you think my husband is possessed by an evil spirit?
Yes, we did eat the food in the boxes.{nl}Why do you ask?
Are you saying that my husband became sick from eating the spoilt food?{nl}And he just gradually got worse because he wasn't treated in time?{nl}What can I do to cure my husband?
Report to the Exorcist Master about the couple.
So the husband was sick from eating spoilt food and his condition grew worse because it wasn't treated in time.{nl}I am relieved to hear that he wasn't possessed but it sounds like he's desperately in need of help.
Tell the Plague Doctor Master about the sick husband for help.
Plague Doctor Master
It saddens me to hear that there are people who must survive on spoilt food.{nl}I will give you a prescription for a medicine that can cure him.
This should be enough for both husband and wife so please deliver this to them.
A medicine that will cure my husband?
Thank you so much.{nl}My husband can finally get better.
It's so considerate of you to have prepared enough medicine for me as well.
I need to get better soon so I can do some work around the house...
Thank you for your help.
What will I ever do if my husband dies?
Thank you for helping my husband get better...{nl}I will be more careful in the future not to eat spoilt food.
Let's return to the Exorcist Master.
A man named Zigmas is claiming he is possessed.{nl}Go and investigate whether he is really possessed or not.
Go and investigate whether Zigmas is really possessed or not.
Zigmas
I need help.{nl}A strange man torments me in my dreams every night.{nl}When I awake the next day I find that people around me are hurt.
Before the nightmare I suffer from an intense fever.{nl}When I finally fall asleep the strange man appears and torments me.{nl}Just the sight of him paralyzes my body so I can't get away from him.
Zigmas has a fever and sees a strange man in his dreams.
Others tell me that I sleepwalk and wave my fists in the air as if assaulting someone.{nl}They say that whenever I am sleepwalking it smells like a rotting corpse.{nl}I think this happens when I am suffering in my dreams.
He mentioned the smell of a rotting corpse.
All I can remember is what happened in my dream.{nl}I find out that I've hurt someone when I awake but I don't have any memory of it. 
He has no memory of hurting anyone.
What is it that you sprayed on me?{nl}It feels like my skin is burning!{nl}It hurts!
He has strong reactions to Holy Water.
There is no doubt he is possessed. Let's tell the Exorcist Master.
Very good. He is indeed possessed.
Let's move on to the next step.
Next, we will see you in action.{nl}There is a nightmare-inducing orb on the outskirts of Fedimian.{nl}Investigation by Exorcists has shown that the orb is possessed by an evil spirit.
Go and exorcise the evil spirits.{nl}All the items that you need for an exorcism are written on this parchment.
Read the parchment carefully and prepare yourself.
Exorcist Master's Parchment
Evil spirits are weak against all things holy and will do anything in their power to get away from them.{nl}It is recommended that you purify the surroundings before proceeding with the ritual.{nl}Spray Holy Water and burn Gyslotis to purify your surroundings, and arrange Blessed Goddess Statues around you to weaken the evil spirit.{nl}Obtain all the necessary items before you proceed.
You can get the Gyslotis and Holy Water from the Priest Master.{nl}Then ask for the Dievdirbys Master's help in making a Blessed Goddess Statue and you will be ready.
A Blessed Goddess Statue? For an exorcism?
Then I will need some Topaz Fragments to build it.{nl}I don't need too many, I just need 12 fragments.
That is enough Topaz Fragments.
You've collected the Topaz Fragments.{nl}Give them to me?{nl}I'll make the statue for you right away.
Here you go.{nl}Use the Blessed Goddess Statue to exorcise the evil spirits.
The orb is afloat mid-air, emanating a dizzyingly ominous energy.
Ominous Orb
The orb is afloat mid-air, emanating a dizzyingly ominous energy.
I feel ready. I'll proceed with the exorcism.
It seems the preparations were out of order. The curse of the evil spirits is strong.
The ritual can't continue due to the evil spirits' curse.
Hallowventers emerged from the ominous orb.
Defeated all the Hallowventers.
You have completed an exorcism.{nl}At last, you have qualified to become an Exorcist.
First, gain the approval of the Krivis Master, the Priest Master, and the Inquisitor Master.
As an Exorcist, you must be aware that you could also fall under demonic possession at any time.{nl}Evil spirits will jump at the first chance they see to possess our souls.
Since Medzio Diena, it seems that those who could not be saved by the grace of the Goddess are becoming evil spirits.{nl}It saddens me to think that there is no salvation for them.
I was in dire need of help...{nl}Thank the Goddess you're here.
One day I noticed that a new obelisk appeared in the forest.{nl}Since then, the monsters grew more violent and began attacking the shelter in groups.
We've evacuated all the women and children and gathered the able men to defend the shelter.{nl}But it was beyond our power to run the invading monsters out of the shelter.
I thank you sincerely for your help.{nl}Let's go to where the refugees are.
I began spotting new monsters in Mishekan Forest since a couple of days ago.{nl}I did not give it much mind because such things were commonplace since Medzio Diena.
I should never have let it pass.{nl}These monsters were extremely violent and they wanted to destroy our lives.
I lead an investigation to find out where they were coming from and found that they entered the forest through some kind of a portal.{nl}The Akhlass that arrived through the portal built an obelisk which strengthened the monsters.
We tried to handle the situation by destroying the obelisk and reinforcing defense plans, but the obelisk was quickly rebuilt and our plans were outsmarted.
Please destroy the portal so that the monsters can't attack our village.
We were in such a desolate state before you came.{nl}I can't fight the monsters myself, but I can help.
If you bring me some sacks I can make some bombs for you.
Please defend our village.
I saw Nagles when he was hurt while defending the shelter from the monsters.{nl}I'm afraid that I might suffer the same fate.
Here you go.{nl}Please defend our village from the monsters.
We lived here for over 3 years.{nl}This shelter is like a home to us.{nl}Please stop the monsters from ruining our lives.
I first found the portal on the path heading right from Pavojingas Lot.{nl}Later, I found more portals in Agresyvus and Saughus Lots.
We tried destroying the portals ourselves but the monsters were too strong.
The obelisk is in the area further past the Phavegheliai Farmland, Atstumas Pond and Preivhengikas Felled Area.
Only the Akhlass will be at Atstumas Pond but in the rest of the areas there are strange objects.
There are floating crystals near the obelisk in Preivhengikas Felled Area that follow you and shoot lightening.{nl}And there are orbs in Phavegheliai Farmland that explode when you touch them.{nl}These objects are so powerful that even the monsters are killed off by them.
We destroyed the obelisk but it was rebuilt within a minute.{nl}It was as if the obelisks were sharing some sort of a regenerating energy between them.
Nobody gave any thought when Wekin's reported seeing monsters that were never before seen in the Mishekan Forest.{nl}It's because such things are so commonplace these days.
Looking back at it now, we should have listened.
We spotted some new monsters in Pavojingas Lot and Mishekan Forest.{nl}I thought the whole world was going mad.
More and more monsters started appearing in Mishekan Forest.{nl}We thought it was strange so we investigated it to find that monsters were arriving through a portal.
At first they didn't do us any harm so we paid it no mind, but soon they started attacking the shelter in small numbers, then in groups.{nl}We tried to stop them on our own but we couldn't.
Soon after the portals were found, the skin of monsters in Mishekan Forest grew harder.{nl}Their skin also became poisonous.{nl}When I went to Mishekan Forest to investigate I saw some Akhlass building an obelisk.{nl}I suspected that the obelisk was what caused the monsters to become stronger so I blew it up with a bomb.{nl}
But after a minute, the obelisk was regenerated.
Us refugees joined forces to destroy all the obelisks we could find, but that didn't stop the obelisks from regenerating.{nl}Curtis said that he thinks if there is at least one obelisk remaining all the destroyed obelisks would regenerate.
{nl}Because of what he said, we planned to destroy all obelisks simultaneously but we couldn't because the monsters started to attack our shelter.
Try to destroy all the obelisks at once.
I was hurt while defending the shelter from monsters so I cannot move.{nl}I can't fight the monsters myself but I can help.
If you bring me sacks I will build for you ballistas, turrets and other devices that will help with the defense.
I saw this coming.{nl}I asked for help from Fedimian, Orsha and Klaipeda but they all ignored us.{nl}They practically abandoned us.
Curtis, oblivious to the situation, kept saying that we should wait for reinforcements to arrive...{nl}But I knew from the start that we are all going to die.
We had enough food to be self-sufficient so I didn't think there would be a problem but now that monsters are attacking there is no hope for us.
Everyone is doing their best to defend the shelter but there's only so much we can do without the help from soldiers.
I knew that one day this life would come to an end, but it is hard to accept now that it actually is.
Frostbites, monsters, food...{nl}Everything around us seems to be a threat.
I want to show Salewya that there is still hope.{nl}I won't let the monsters take over this shelter.
Ah, Revelator...{nl}The herbalist just told me a strange rumor.{nl}
Some soldiers were spotted being lead someplace by someone near Nheto Forest.{nl}They say that the soldiers were acting a bit funny.
It was just a rumor I heard so... I don't have the details.{nl}But if this turns out to be true, I am afraid that the soldiers might be in trouble.{nl}
The person who was leading the soldiers didn't seem like a general.{nl}And the soldiers were acting a bit strange so...{nl}
Could you investigate Nheto Forest for me?{nl}You may find some evidence regarding the incident.
Search the Pjama Resting Place in Nheto Forest.{nl}They say that the soldiers were spotted passing the area.
I do hope it's nothing serious.{nl}It's just a rumor after all.
Just as you've said, Revelator. It could just be a rumor or an exaggeration.
Head to the Pjama Resting Place in Nheto Forest.
Someone is sitting there.
The man seems to be in a bewildered state.{nl}Could he be related to the rumors? It's best to try and talk to him again.
The man seems to not hear anything.{nl}Try a different method?
Arvydas
Hmm... Is that why you came to this place?{nl}The rumors you've heard are true.{nl}
I was being lead somewhere by someone along with all the other soldiers.{nl}I remember hearing a tune from a flute which mesmerized us...{nl}
Well, I fell out of the group so I have no idea where the other soldiers are.{nl}
Aw... My head's beginning to hurt again.{nl}
I... I want to ask you if you could tell Commander Vacenin about this?{nl}My name is Alwedas.{nl}
I was under Commander Vacenin's command once, so he should remember me.{nl}
And... And please tell him to come get me out of here.{nl}I beg of you.
Please tell Commander Vacenin about all of this and ask him to get me out of here.{nl}Ouch... My head is hurting again...
Go to Commander Vacenin at the entrance of Kateen Forest and tell him about the situation.
Arvydas was an able soldier who used to be under my command.{nl}
We used to keep in contact after he was transferred to the Fallen City but he stopped corresponding...{nl}Now I know why...{nl}
I will send some soldiers to rescue Arvydas.{nl}However... I am concerned about the mention of the sound of flutes.{nl} 
Do you know about the Pied Piper Master?{nl}He is a man of legendary renown when it comes to flutes.{nl}
I assume that this incident may have something to do with the Pied Piper Master.{nl}Why don't you go pay him a visit to see if he knows anything?
I do not know his whereabouts, as the Pied Piper Master is known to wander from place to place.{nl}
Perhaps the Oracle Master knows where he is, so go consult with the Oracle Master in Klaipeda.
If you insist.{nl}I will find someone else for the job.
The Oracle Master in Klaipeda will know where the Pied Piper Master is.{nl}If you do find the Pied Piper Master, ask him if he knows anything regarding the incident.
Visit the Oracle Master in Klaipeda to ask where the Pied Piper Master could be.
You've come.{nl}I knew that you would come to see me.{nl}
Could I ask you why you are looking for the Pied Piper Master?
I see.{nl}The Pied Piper Master is involved in quite a large number of incidents.{nl}
You should be able to find him in the Forest of Prayer.
I almost forgot. Take this with you.{nl}This note contains the location of the Pied Piper Master just in case you forget.{nl}
You will be asked to do many tasks once you meet the Pied Piper Master.{nl}You accomplish the tasks much more easily if you keep a track of the given tasks on this note. 
The Piped Piper Master is in the Forest of Prayer.{nl}His location is in the note I gave you.{nl}You can also keep a track of the tasks that he will give you on the note.
Pied Piper Master
You've come to see me?{nl}It's been quite a while since I had a visitor.{nl}
Could you tell me what you wanted to see me for?
There have been rumors about this...{nl}This is my fault.{nl}
I will not deny that I have something to do with the said rumors.{nl}
You may not know, but I have apprentices all over the lands.{nl}The rumor you speak of has to do with a very talented apprentice of mine.{nl}
The soldiers in the area suffered from some kind of a mental breakdown so that disciple came to me for help.{nl}
Leaving the soldiers in their current state...{nl}It would have been dangerous for both the soldiers and the people around them.{nl}
It was I, along with my apprentice, that lead the soldiers through the forest in order to prevent such a thing from happening.{nl}
The soldiers are mentally unstable so I cannot tell you where they are in their current state.{nl}They are like a ticking time bomb.
You may not know but I have apprentices all over the lands.{nl}The rumor you speak of has to do with a very talented apprentice of mine named Ejuidas.{nl}
I have heard stories about you, the Revelator, through Eivydas.{nl}
As you already know, the soldiers are mentally unstable.{nl}Eivydas realized that the task was too big for him and came to me to seek help.{nl}
It was I, along with Eivydas, that lead the soldiers through the forest in order to prevent such a thing from happening.{nl}
Can't give up like this.{nl}Talk to the Pied Piper Master again.
It's you again.{nl}I already told you that I cannot disclose to you the whereabouts of the soldiers.
Hmm... I could not cure the soldiers' mental illness on my own.{nl}I searched out the other Masters in order to find a cure for them.{nl}
Other Masters did not have any ideas so all they said was that they will consult with the Plague Doctor Master.{nl}If you are worried about the soldiers, why don't you go talk to the Plague Doctor Master to see if he can help?
I could go myself but it's almost time for me to go and check the state of the soldiers.{nl}I hope for you to bring back good news.
Go visit the Plague Doctor Master and see whether he's developed a cure.{nl}You should be able to find him in the Istora Ruins.
Visit the Plague Doctor Master in the Istora Ruins.
You've come because of the soldiers and the Pied Piper Master.{nl}
I do not know whether I can cure the soldiers' illness completely...{nl}
But I have thought up a cure to help them recover a little.{nl}If I had the ingredients I would be able to make it right away but there are so many ingredients that I need.{nl}
If you're in a hurry, could you help me find the ingredients?
You only need to bring me one ingredient.{nl}I will obtain the remaining ingredients myself.{nl}
You will find bushes around Wood Watch Tower in Vilna Forest and Land Reserved for Maras Bee Farm.{nl}Bring me some Perilla, which is a purple herb that can be found inside those bushes.{nl}
I think 30 Perilla leaves should be enough for the concoct the cure.{nl}Thank you.
Bring me some Perilla, which is a purple herb that grows inside the bushes near the Vilna Forest and Land Reserved for Maras Bee Farm.{nl}I think 30 Perilla leaves should be enough for me to concoct the cure.
I will go gather the other ingredients.
You've found them all.{nl}I've just gathered all the remaining ingredients as well.
It won't take long to concoct the cure so please wait.
Take this cure.{nl}And go see the Chronomancer Master to tell her about this incident and show her the cure I gave you.{nl}
A downside to this cure is that its potency is reduced with passing time.{nl}I have already spoken to the Pied Piper Master about this.{nl}
The Chronomancer Master was there with us at the time.{nl}She spoke of devising a way to improve this shortcoming.{nl}
Go to Stele Road and visit the Chronomancer Master.
Take the cure I gave you and visit the Chronomancer Master in Stele Road.{nl}The Chronomancer Master should know of a way to prevent the cure from losing its potency over time.
Visit the Chronomancer Master in Stele Road.
I remember talking with the Pied Piper Master about the cure for the soldiers who were mentally ill.{nl}
And I did tell the Plague Doctor Master that I'd thought of a way to prevent the cure from losing its potency over time.{nl}The cure in your hands must be the very cure that is suffering from the loss of potency.{nl}
To prevent this from happening, I thought that I would need to think of a new vessel for the cure.{nl}A vessel that will insulate its contents completely.{nl}
I need some ingredients in order to make such a vessel.{nl}Obtaining the ingredients is a process that may take some time...{nl}Since you seem to be in a hurry, could you collect the ingredients for me?
There is a lot of sand in Igti Coast.{nl}Collect the Glowing Blue Sand in the glass bottle I give you.{nl}
You will have to fill the bottle to the brim as the Glowing Blue Sand is the main ingredient in making the vessel.{nl} Try looking in the areas around the Sahguma Lagoon, Lemyra Reef and Lamdonas Coral Reef.{nl}Keep your eyes out for areas with a blue glow.{nl}
That's where the Glowing Blue Sand can be found.{nl}
You can use the glass bottle to collect Glowing Blue Sand around the Igti Coast area other than the places I've mentioned.{nl}You will still be able to find at least some Glowing Blue Sand.
Search the Igti Coast's Sahguma Lagoon, Lemyra Sentry and Lamdonas Coral Reef areas.{nl}Keep your eyes out for areas with a blue glow.{nl}
The areas with the bluish glow are where you can find the Glowing Blue Sand.{nl} Use the bottle in these areas to collect the Glowing Blue Sand.{nl}
You can use the glass bottle to collect Glowing Blue Sand around the Igti Coast area other than the places I've mentioned.{nl}You will still be able to find at least some Glowing Blue Sand.{nl}
Fill the bottle to the brim with the Glowing Blue Sand.{nl}I will be making the preparations for making the vessel in the meantime.
You have returned with the Glowing Blue Sand.{nl}I have prepared all the other materials so we should be able to start right away.{nl}
 I will make the vessel for you if you wait just a little while.
Now the cure contained within this vessel won't lose its potency over time.{nl}
Why not go visit the Priest Master before you deliver the cure to the Pied Piper Master?{nl}
I've heard that demons were to blame for the mental illness of the soldiers.{nl}The cure won't improve the soldiers' illness completely if it is the work of demons. There could be a curse or a demonic power at work.{nl}
Visit the Priest Master and ask him if he can bless the cure.{nl}If there is a curse or any demonic power at work it will increase the efficacy of the cure.{nl}Even if there isn't, a blessing won't do any harm to the soldiers so it should be safe.
I've talked to the Priest Master about this already so go seek him out.{nl}The Priest Master should be in Klaipeda.
Ask the Priest Master in Klaipeda to bless the cure.{nl}It will increase the efficacy of the cure if there is a curse or a demonic power behind the illness of soldiers.
Visit the Priest Master in Klaipeda.
The Chronomancer Master mentioned your arrival.{nl}So you've come to ask me to bless the cure.{nl}
Hand me the cure and I will bless it for you.
Here you go.{nl}Now deliver the cure to the Pied Piper Master.{nl}
I have heard that there are soldiers who are suffering from a mental illness.{nl}I do hope the cure can improve the soldiers' illness.
Deliver the cure to the Pied Piper Master.{nl}I heard that the Pied Piper Master can be found in the Forest of Prayer.
Deilver the cure to the Pied Piper Master in the Forest of Prayer.
You have brought the cure.{nl}I was just returning from checking on the soldiers.{nl}I was relieved to find that the soldiers' condition hasn't worsened.
I do not know whether the cure will work but I will have to trust the Plague Doctor Master.{nl}If it is at the least bit effective, then it means there is hope in curing the soldiers.{nl}
It looks like we have enough cure for all the soldiers.{nl}
And the soldier that was rescued by Commander Vacenin will also be needing the cure.{nl}If the cure is proven effective, I will take the cure to Commander Vacenin myself.
As a side note, you seem to have what it takes to become a Pied Pier.{nl}Please come to see me if you ever wish to become a Pied Piper.

You need to win a few more times for that.
Didn't I already give you that?{nl}I'd get you another one if I could but, you know, limited stock.
If we don't do anything, people will be hurt.{nl}General Lhamin wants to mobilize an army to suppress the Schaffenstar. Other Masters are already trying to convince him.{nl}But being away from my carrier hawk, I can't guarantee that it stays safe everywhere.{nl}I hope you can help reduce monster forces where we most need it.
If you ever hear the hawk cry for help, use the  
 I gave you to find the hawk and bring it to me.
The Masters all want to avoid a war with fellow humans, but we still need time to form a plan that everyone agrees with.
My friend came back safe and sound, thanks to you.{nl}I appreciate it.
Your role is very important.{nl}If we can't convince General Lhamin, humans will go to war and it's the demons who will get the upper hand.{nl}Go to where I told you and take out the monsters there. We need to make sure the carrier hawk stays safe.
The other Masters are sparing no efforts for our cause.{nl}Your precious help will be remembered.
I almost lost a friend there. Thanks for saving him.
You took out the monsters. Thank you.{nl}Hm... The carrier hawk should be back by now.{nl}I'm worried that something might have happened.
If you're out fighting monsters and you hear the hawk cry for help, use the  
No, I get it. You have bigger things to do.{nl}I'll try and find him myself.{nl}Thanks for the help.
Thanks.{nl}If you heard him cry, that means he's hiding somewhere nearby.
It's very important that we keep the communication going not just with the General, but with Byle from the resistance army as well.{nl}It's already a problem that we're in contact with Lhamin, but if word gets out that we talked to Byle, we could get into deep trouble with the Schaffenstar.
Fortunately we got the General's permission, but he wants a list of signatures from the Masters.{nl}That's why we need to contact Owynia Dilben, who apparently is dispatched all the way in Nicopolis.
As you can probably guess, the General is worried about the Masters' intentions.{nl}If I lose my carrier hawk, it'll give him the wrong impression.{nl}But with your help, everything is going according to plan.{nl}Thank you.
I agreed to report back to the General every now and then.{nl}We're very close now.{nl}Our efforts are going to pay off very soon, you'll see.
I thought I gave it to you already.{nl}Remember?
Just do this one last thing for me. I'll make sure to pay you back.
Everything is going as planned, thanks to you.{nl}I'm counting on you to finish this off.
I take care of funding, I get the recruits, now another thing pops up.{nl}We're gonna need to keep everyone's positions a secret.
Stragglers and wounded soldiers are always a drag, but as it turns out, having their positions known is an even bigger problem.{nl}You see, not everyone there is a mercenary or a volunteer.{nl}I could really use your help.
Any supply that's not exclusively for military use is being sent to refugees as well.{nl}There's no need to keep the soldiers in the dark about where they're headed.{nl}But we can't afford having any distractions delay the shipments, either.
We're in the process of creating a few bases and assembly areas along the way to the Starlit Lake.{nl}Our troops are traveling along the same route, but they each have different destinations.{nl}If anything happens while the troops are moving, that could really set us back. That's why we need the help.
The supplies have been making their way to the resistance with no major issues.{nl}We may not be able to help them out with firepower, but at least they can focus on the battle with Ignas without worrying too much.{nl}Not only that, our troops are ready to step in and protect the refugee communities around the lake, which also helps the resistance.
Our troops may not be fighting together with the resistance, but we've been keeping the demons from joining Ignas in the battle.{nl}That way Byle doesn't have to worry about Ignas' side getting support from the outside.
I heard our soldiers got to make the first siege around the lake.{nl}We're gonna keep adding troops to the siege, make sure the resistance has some backup.
We're all counting on you, buddy.{nl}Be careful.
Thanks to you, we reached our destination safely.{nl}We, the Masters, thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
You did a great job today.{nl}See you again tomorrow.
Your work has been so important to our cause.{nl}We're counting on you.

Beggar
A person...?{nl}I'm not sure.
I did wake up to the sound of someone running.{nl}I was just about to go back to sleep when these clothes fell on top of me.{nl}I tend to get cold quite often so I figured luck was on my side and kept the clothes.
No, I didn't see them.{nl}I only heard them run up the stairs.
The clothes look burnt. Look for more clues.
This looks like it could be worn by an adult man. Look for more clues.
The clothes give off a faint chemical smell. Tell Auguste Dupin about all the clues.
Chemist
I know I have a criminal record, but all I want to do is live a quiet life.{nl}Please... I'm trying to start over.
I was released from my sentence a few months ago, so I was looking around for a place to stay.{nl}That's how I ended up here.
It was nothing more than a coincidence.
I had gone out to buy chemicals and I was on my way back home.
I make and distribute chemicals, you see.{nl}To the artist that lives here and Kelly, the owner of the Magic Shop.
Everyone suspects a criminal.{nl}If word gets out about my crimes, I could lose my place here and get deported from the town.
I didn't want that to happen. That's why I ran.{nl}Please, promise you won't tell anyone about my past.
Burnt Clothes
The clothes are burnt.
What could this research possibly be for the demons to want it so much?
Quipmage.{nl}Once a despicable human, now making deals with demons... I'm not even surprised.
Alright. You have a deal.
Get those research documents. You cursed creature.
Please check the Resident Logs at the secretary.

Former Fantasy Library: Sausis Room 9. Only you and your party members will be able to enter together.{nl}Do you wish to enter?{nl}(Recommended Level: 330)
I don't know how they found us either... But we need to save Velad and the other Kupoles.
Velad.{nl}We must join forces and face the demons!
The pain of being at the mercy of the Divine Tree made me think.{nl}If those we served for so long really cared for us, would they allow us to suffer like this?
If they truly cared for us Kupoles, would they ever have left us alone...{nl}If I were strong enough not to depend on someone, would this have happened to me?
What are you trying to say?
The goddesses have abandoned us.{nl}No one can look after us now.
We are weak. Trying to fight the demons will only take us further into Giltine's grip.{nl}I'd rather run away and live in peace.
So you're willing to abandon your sisters who are suffering to save your own life?
Do you think we have any chance of saving them from the demons without our goddesses?
Zsaia. We aren't strong enough to face the demons.{nl}First we need to save our sisters and go to our goddess.
Velad. The goddesses have not abandoned us. They are resisting the demons in Their own ways.{nl}Please, have faith.
Revelator.{nl}Please rescue Zsaia before she is taken by the Divine Tree.
Are you ready? Let's move on then.{nl}I'll go ahead.
No more arrows on this side.{nl}Now we need to clear out this evil energy.
Yes, of course. The fact that you made it here means you disabled all the traps on the way.{nl}Now I and those who come after me can go back in safety.
Understood. That will let us stop all the protection devices and turn off the defenses.
I'm glad we don't need to worry about those traps anymore.{nl}Now we can focus on the operation.
You've defeated Cezaris! Have you found his key?{nl}
Now we have collected all the keys.{nl}We can finally move to 21F. I will go ahead and make preparations. Meet me in front of the elevator on 21F.
Let's move on to 21F where we have Ignas cornered.{nl}Let's go!
Thanks to you, we've set up camp at the Third Observatory and secured a good view of the area.{nl}Meet me back at the camp. There are too many demons here.
You've finally defeated Ignas!{nl}Have you found the Revelation yet?{nl}
Yes...{nl}It's really over... We have come out victorious.{nl}
Our men need to rest. Let's meet back at the base to talk.
So it was you who turned off the defenses! I was surprised when the arrows stopped so suddenly.
Thank you for turning off the defenses. Our members are going to need some time to organize now.{nl}In the meantime, we should discuss the next step in the operation. This way, please.
Elder Henika
Your journey was arduous and exhausting, I am sure.{nl}
Alas, there is nowhere to go from here. This is where you must die.
Worry not. The pain will not last.{nl}You will be long gone before that!
Here you are, Henika!{nl}You despicable man, what are you trying to do this time!?
All that toxic smoke outside, was that you!?{nl}Do you know how many of our members are suffering because of you!?
So you came, Byle. Yes... Many of them perished...{nl}Don't you see, it was all in the name of Ignas' noble cause!{nl}
Dare to resist and you too will die!
You've lost your mind, Henika...{nl}That demon in disguise deserves to pay for his crimes!
Attention!{nl}Henika is conspiring against our allies and he's now attempting to escape!
Pursue him! But be cautious! We don't know what he could have done.{nl}He's holding information, so it's crucial that we capture him alive. Now go! After him!
Revelator, Henika is pure evil.{nl}I don't know what else he'll do if we leave him be!{nl}
I'm sending our soldiers out to track him.{nl}Meanwhile, I need you to eliminate the demons he summoned.
You're here... I'm sorry. The energy is too strong, it's hard to even move.{nl}The same is happening to our members... We can't give up yet...
I heard of you. Do not be startled.{nl}I am Adaux, Elder of the Schaffenstar.{nl}
I heard whispers coming from Henika's key. Your voices.{nl}It seems you too have been taken by the evil energy.{nl}
This energy Ignas released after your attack, it will not let me move.{nl}Do you not need to stop Ignas?{nl}
Allow me to make a proposal. I will tell you the way to disable his defenses.{nl}Instead, you must help me escape from the Astral Tower.
Are you suggesting we even consider this questionable proposal?
Yes... I understand you have reasons to distrust me.{nl}But I am different. I am not Henika, the owner of that key, who so foolishly followed Ignas.{nl}
I have no desire for power. I convinced the Elders and became an informant to Ignas.{nl}But Ignas – he made a pact with the demons and turned the lives of the Schaffenstar, the Elders, and even himself...{nl}
He turned us all into monsters for his own cause.
Wait. You say he turned you into monsters... Do you mean...?
So it is. Our deranged leader turned us all into demons.{nl}Myself and my subordinates suffered the same fate.{nl}
The few members who have escaped Ignas' power are now by my side.{nl}You may not trust me, but I ask that you have the mercy to help them.
Aid us in our escape and I will tell you about what is happening in the Tower, and what you must do.{nl}We are prepared to abandon the Tower and never return.
Revelator, Adaux's proposal seems far too uncertain. But on the other hand...{nl}As it is, we have close to no information on what is happening inside the Tower.{nl}
There could be more to Henika's plans besides the smoke traps.{nl}If I'm being honest, I believe this is all a plot by Henika. But if we wait any longer, we may just find ourselves with our hands completely tied.{nl}
For now, I think we ought to do as he says and remain alert.
Listen closely.{nl}Ignas installed the demons' machines near the observatory on 21F.{nl}
I do not know how the machines are operated.{nl}All I can tell is that they transformed people of the Schaffenstar into demons.
I believe the devices will produce an energy close to the one that is now spreading near us.{nl}As long as those machines are active, they will keep transforming those inside the Astral Tower into demons.{nl}
They must be stopped.{nl}If not, you too will slowly become demented and transform into a demon.
I am late in my regret, I know. I can only hope to escape and spend the rest of my days in repent.{nl}Byle, I believe you have my key.{nl}
There is much to gather yet.{nl}But I faith in you.{nl}
As a guilty man, it may not be my place to say this.{nl}But I must ask for your help.
Reclaim the Astral Tower, rid us of our suffering.
That is what we are here for.{nl}To take back the holy Astral Tower from its corrupt leader.
Adaux trusted me with a key.{nl}He said we would need it to enter the 21F observatory where Ignas is stationed.
He explained the way to deactivate the defense mechanisms on 20F.{nl}He also told me how to make our way to 20F and 21F.{nl}
I would like to share that information with you first.
Ignas, you despicable man! You sacrificed your own people for power??
Head of the Schaffenstar Ignas
Well, well. If it isn't the Resistance Commander.{nl}I'm surprised you made it this far.{nl}
The question is: can you go any further?
Hahahah, you call that an attack?{nl}I feel sorry for you, Commander, underestimating me with an attack like that.{nl}
Know your place.{nl}I'm not exactly someone you want to be picking a fight with.
You need to know what's good for you!
Elder Henika was caught by your people. Elder Adaux turned his back and betrayed me.{nl}Elder Cezaris, killed by your futile schemes...
This was all your fault.{nl}Everything that's happened to us, down to the fact that your dirty troops were even allowed in here!{nl}
Revelator or not, it was you who ruined every one of my plans!!{nl}But not for much longer. This is where you die, once and for all!
At last, the day for which I have waited for over a thousand years is near.{nl}Soon I will come to you; not as an apparition or a mere image, but as my true self.{nl}
I have shared the pain of the countless keepers whose lives were sacrificed in my name.{nl}Savior, it won't be long now before your efforts bring to fruition our millenary endeavor.{nl}
I will not rush to declare victory.{nl}However, I trust that with you by our side the sacrifices of the keepers will not have been in vain.{nl}
Alas, I'm afraid that our actions, whatever they may be, will always result in another unfortunate sacrifice: that of my sister Giltine.{nl}What's more, our battle will not end with her demise.
Giltine is not the sole goddess amongst the demons.{nl}There exist five other deities below her, serving her.{nl}
After Giltine is defeated, a war with the five Demon Gods will begin.{nl}The final Revelation rests at the place which for eras was at the center of the human Kingdom, 
. That is where we shall face the enemy, in a battle that will both end and start it all.
There's something shiny nearby. Go closer and have a look.
I was waiting for you.{nl}I'm relieved to see you arrive in safety.{nl}
In order to move to the next area, you must find a secret code.{nl}I wish I had more time to explain, but carrying out the plan successfully is of utmost priority.{nl}
Look around. There is a path leading to two different rooms that is not the path you took here.{nl}The path leads to the rooms below and to the library on the right.{nl}
Look for clues in both locations and use them on the pillars standing behind me.{nl}If you decipher the code, a portal will open.{nl}
I will be leaving behind me the guidelines you must follow to find the clues and decipher the code.{nl}Please read them carefully.{nl}
I must go back and focus on disarming the defenses with Hauberk now.{nl}Please hurry.
Encryption Pillar
Please select a bookmark to place on the pillar.
The others don't seem to be ready.{nl}Let us wait for them to finish preparing. 
The other adventurers have yet to arrive.{nl}We will wait for them to join us.
Guidelines
The room below tells you which color of bookmark to place on which pillar.{nl}In the room you will see 4 magic cores and demons roaming in the center.
The demons in the center possess a power different from that of other demons.{nl}You will be able to differentiate them by their appearance.{nl}
Use each of the types of magic core to attract the demons in the center.{nl}The cores will absorb the demons and gain their magic power.{nl}
Repeat this several times with all the magic cores to obtain the information you need.{nl}Once a core is full, it will give out a signal. When you see it, approach the magic core.
The library on the right contains a reading desk and 25 different bookshelves.{nl}First, go near the desk and check the numbers inscribed in it.{nl}
Those numbers will tell you what you need to know.{nl}Decipher the meaning of the numbers and search the bookshelves accordingly.{nl}
Search the correct bookshelves and you will obtain a series of bookmarks.{nl}Once you have collected them all, place them on the pillars in the correct order.
Take the bookmarks from the library and bring them to the four pillars.{nl}Only one bookmark can be placed on each pillar.{nl}
After you have placed all the bookmarks in the correct order, a portal will open.{nl}You may enter through the portal.{nl}
Should you place the bookmarks in an order that is incorrect, the pillars will be momentarily deactivated.{nl}Note, however, that the code will not change even if you fail to guess it.{nl}
To understand the code, go to the room below.{nl}There you will find clues to the correct order of the bookmarks.
Please select a topic.
The traps are visible to the naked eye, so I don't believe it will be difficult to avoid them.{nl}All you need to do is be careful not to fall within their range.
Resistance Soldier Arcadius
Revelator! Hello, it's so nice to see you! I've been waiting for you.{nl}Oh, I bet you're wondering who I am.{nl}
Hahaha, that's alright.{nl}I don't think we ever met in person before.{nl}
You helped the soldiers rescue someone who was taken hostage, right?{nl}Well, that someone was me.{nl}
I was a bit shaken at the time, but thanks to you here I am!{nl}
The library behind me contains all the important literature of the Astral Tower.{nl}This is a very special place, not everyone is allowed to read these books.{nl}
But you saved my life, after all. The least I can do is allow you the honor.{nl}Maybe it's not much, but I hope it will help you.
Oh, Revelator. It looks like you're searching for a book.{nl}Go right in. The library is always open for you.
Please select a book.
Select a quest.
That means you need to shoot at Pbeta!
Kartas
Pbeta.{nl}Look at you, trying to run away... pitiful.{nl}
So. You wanted Ziburynas' Essence...{nl}I did wonder what you could possibly get from betraying Solcomm.
Didn't you think it was little too much for you? Hm?{nl}My, my. You need to start having some discernment.
So you knew... Very well.{nl}
I'll hand over the Essence to you if that is what you want.{nl}But first...
Are you going to try and make a deal with me?{nl}Hahahahahaha!{nl}
Oh, you make my blood boil...!
Please, Kartas. My request is simple.{nl}Give me the power to defeat the Revelator and those who are after me.
Yes, that would be good.
But Pbeta. Don't you dare think about playing me.{nl}Remember, I am not Solcomm.{nl}
You don't want to end up like all the ones who were foolish enough to stand in my way now, do you?{nl}
You do what you have to do and then you come to me.{nl}I don't want you wandering about.
Alright then, let's see what you can do with all that power!
You ruined my plans!{nl}I'll make you regret this...{nl}
Do you know a man by the name of Mcen?{nl}The one who removed his brother from the Astral Tower? His brother was another head of the Tower, along with Ignas.
Because of him, Ignas became the sole head of the Astral Tower and things escalated to where they are now.
This is a warning to all adventurers attempting to enter the Baubas Cave!{nl}The Royal Army has reported that this dungeon is currently inhabited by large numbers of demons.
The pulley system is very old and the ropes could break at any moment.{nl}The pulley system is out of service for now so we advise all adventurers to use an alternative route. The Royal Army.

On the Treatment of Criminal Individuals by the Schaffenstar
* On the Treatment of Criminal Individuals by the Schaffenstar{nl}
For the first time since the attainment of autonomy by the Schaffenstar during the reign of King Barynwell, a serious conflict with an external territory has arisen.{nl}This conflict has now been duly solved through the use of reason. However, for the purpose of preventing similar incidents in the future history of the Schaffenstar, all members have agreed to establish a set of distinct, inviolable rules.{nl}They are as follows.{nl}
One. Any individual found to be violating Royal Law within Schaffestar territory shall be detained and promptly entrusted to the corresponding authorities, regardless of their position or lack thereof within the Schaffenstar.{nl}This rule will not apply to formerly convicted criminals whose sentence has been completed.{nl}Two. Should the violation occur not to the Royal Law but to local regulations, the decision on whether to release the criminal shall lie with the head of the Schaffenstar.{nl}If the individual is considered inculpable, those at the Schaffenstar will protect them unconditionally.{nl}Any expenses derived from such an incident shall be charged to the territory or noble family involved.
Three. The Starlit Lake, the Astral Tower, and the Schaffenstar constitute a self-governing society recognized as such by Royal Law. This society follows the tradition of the Great Lydia Schaffen in the protection of the goddesses and the Kingdom.{nl}Therefore, all other territories and noble families are to cooperate with the Schaffenstar and surrender to us, at no cost, any criminal considered so by our regulations.{nl}If the territory's authority does not comply with this condition, those responsible for it shall be punished accordingly.{nl}All lords and nobles of the Kingdom are to respect the aforementioned rules with no exceptions.{nl}

On the Occupation of Concurrent Posts by Members of the Schaffenstar
* On the Occupation of Concurrent Posts by Members of the Schaffenstar{nl}
In the past 169 years, it has become a common occurrence for members of the Schaffenstar to ascend to the position of Master in various classes of the Archer tree.{nl}The results of this, however, have not been positive, both in cases where the new Master remains in the Astral Tower and those where they choose to abandon it.
Frequent visits by non-members of the Schaffenstar for matters related to the work of the Masters force visitors to endure long journeys to the Tower, and place on our members the burden of continuously entertaining the guests.{nl}While we admire and support the noble endeavors of our Masters, in order to avoid further inconveniences, we have agreed to apply as of this day the following rules.{nl}
One. Any Schaffenstar member who ascends to the position of Class Master shall have their status altered to honorary member and be forbidden from practicing their Master duties within the Astral Tower.{nl}
Two. Honorary members shall be considered as legitimate constituents of the Shaffenstar, and they shall be duly revered as such.{nl}Should an honorary member retire from their position as Master, they shall be allowed the status of Elder of the Schaffenstar.{nl}In the event of death, any honorary member shall be granted the posthumous status of Elder, unless expressed otherwise.{nl}
Three. During their service as Masters, honorary members will not be granted authority in official matters concerning the Schaffenstar.{nl}
Four. During their service as Masters, honorary members will not receive the benefits and compensation attributed to Schaffenstar members.{nl}Instead, any sum corresponding to salaries, pensions, etc. shall be accumulated at and managed by the Schaffenstar. The total will then be conferred to the Master upon their return to the Astral Tower.
Annex 1. Archer tree Class Masters not originating from the Schaffenstar may, if they so wish, apply to the status of honorary member at the organization under these same rules.{nl}
Annex 2. The aforementioned rules will also apply to Schaffenstar members who ascend to the position of Master of a class not in the Archer tree.
Rules Concerning the Status of Schaffenstar Members
* Rules Concerning the Status of Schaffenstar Members{nl}
One. Should a member of the Schaffenstar wish to serve as a public official of the Kingdom or in the Royal Army, they are required to alert the head of the organization before the application is submitted.{nl}
Two. Unless a violation of Royal Law is committed, such members shall maintain their rights and duties as constituents of the Schaffenstar.{nl}
Three. Contrary to article two of this document, should a member be appointed to a position above that of Head of the Schaffenstar, they shall receive the status of honorary member.{nl}They shall be duly revered as high officials of the Kingdom, as are other honorary members.{nl}As of this date, this rule applies to Schaffenstar members currently serving in the position of Chancellor and General.{nl}
Four. Members of the Royal Family who become part of the Schaffenstar shall receive no special treatment.{nl}However, should they be appointed to one of the higher positions mentioned by article three of this document, they too shall receive proper reverence as honorary members of the organization.{nl}
Five. The Schaffenstar shall not differentiate members based on their social status or background.{nl}
Six. Members shall not receive orders from lords or nobles without permission from the Head of the Schaffenstar.{nl}Should a member accept such an order in a situation where it cannot be reported, that order may be canceled if it is later opposed by the Head of the Schaffenstar.{nl}
Seven. Members are required to prioritize orders commanded by the Head of the Schaffenstar over those originating from lords and nobles external to the organization.{nl}
Eight. The same rules described in the articles above shall apply to duties and authorities originating from Cleric organizations and orders.{nl}This excludes, however, commands directly enacted by the goddesses.{nl}
Nine. Cases where none of the aforementioned rules apply shall be judged by the Head of the Schaffenstar.
The Schaffenstar Code of Conduct (Excerpt)
* The Schaffenstar Code of Conduct (Excerpt){nl}
No. 125: Visits to the highest floors of the Tower and access to the telescopes must be supervised by an Elder, or any member of equal or superior status.{nl}
No. 126: Offensive devices aimed at the lower floors must be repaired and maintained under the supervision of an Elder, or any member of equal or superior status.{nl}Members on the lower floors must be alerted a minimum of 1 hour prior to any operation, and all lower floors must be completely evacuated in advance.{nl}
No. 127: Impeding access to elevators is forbidden in situations of war or preparation for battle.{nl}In cases of emergency, elevators may be disabled or destroyed.{nl}
No. 128: Trainee members must remain cautious not to temper with the Water Facilities when cleaning or performing other tasks at the lake.{nl}

Schaffenstar Confidential Documents
* Schaffenstar Confidential Documents{nl}
Access to the following documents is restricted to the Head of the Schaffenstar and authorized persons only.{nl}If found, please return to the Head of the Schaffenstar immediately.{nl}
The present document serves to record and categorize confidential information kept by the Heads of the Schaffenstar since Lydia Schaffen, founder and first leader of the organization.{nl}My intent is to preserve in written form the information that has for centuries been passed on exclusively through oral tradition. This will ensure the conservation of our secrets to future leaders of the Schaffenstar in the event of my unexpected death or other unfortunate events.{nl}
As it would be dangerous to compile all the information in a single document, it is my goal to divide it into chapters and hide each document in a secret location of the tower.{nl}I ask future leaders of the Schaffenstar that they, too, keep these confidential documents hidden in that manner.{nl}Should the position of head of the organization continue to be passed on through oral tradition, I predict there will be no need to consult the hidden documents.{nl}
The next Head of the Schaffenstar, should they ascend to their position in a manner that is unconventional, may not be aware of these secret locations. However, I am certain that they will be able to discover them through the process of their initiation in the role.{nl}
Confidential: It is a well-known fact that Lydia Schaffen defeated the great demon Ziburynas and sent another demon by the name of Rumpelstiltskin to the Moon.{nl}Schaffen was not aware of it at the time, but her heroic achievements would produce a significant impact in the hierarchical order of the demonic world.{nl}
Lydia Schaffen was the first human to ever become involved in a major power shift of the demonic world, with her actions triggering a full-scale crisis in the demon realm.{nl}The one referred to in ancient texts as the Beholder suffered a significant blow to his status, and while Giltine herself may have remained unscathed, several demons serving her were also severely affected.{nl}
The details of how the death of a demon lord and the disappearance of Rumpelstiltskin affected the position of several lower-ranked demons remain unknown.{nl}What we know for certain is that those events gave way to a period of serious turbulence in the demons' hierarchical systems.{nl}This shift provides the background information we need to understand the future actions of three demons in particular.{nl}
They are Demon Goddess Ragana, Demon Lord Baiga and Demon Lord Hauberk. Little is known about them, but we have reasons to believe that they will attempt to act contrarily to demon traditions.{nl}This, of course, does not mean that they will act in favor of humans, which is why our society must remain vigilant of the actions of these demons who are at the center of the upheaval.{nl}

Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 1
* Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 1{nl}
Demon Lord Solcomm is and will remain unable to successfully attack the Astral Tower by force after its completion.{nl}This statement is supported by the records that follow.{nl}
Solcomm's first step was to gather demon forces in large numbers.{nl}The area just beyond the tower's defense range is entirely covered by demons and monsters.{nl}
Transporting a large number of demons into the human realm is no easy task, which is causing a gap between the arrival of each offensive group.{nl}This, of course, is advantageous to the Schaffenstar.{nl}
More advantageous still is being under the command of Lydia Schaffen, who is widely known as a prolific conqueror of demons.{nl}At last, with the construction of the Astral Tower complete, we can stand against the demons.{nl}It is time to prove to them that we are not a target to underestimate.
Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 2
* Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 2{nl}
The first day of battle.{nl}Members of the Schaffenstar were outside scraping the bottom of the lake when a group of demons breached the tower's range of defense in a sudden attack.{nl}
The sentinels atop the tower sounded the alarm.{nl}Approaching the tower unseen is virtually impossible in favorable weather conditions.{nl}Not only that, the lake rarely attracts the formation of fog.{nl}That is, in fact, one of the reasons why our leader chose this location for the construction of the tower.{nl}
Upon hearing the alarm, the members working on the lake immediately collected their tools and returned to the tower.{nl}From far away, the members would have looked as if they were standing atop the surface of the water, as was usual.{nl}
They ran towards the tower, calm and composed. Naturally so, as all members had received prior training.{nl}The early alarm allowed those working outside to enter the tower in time to prevent the demons' attack from succeeding.{nl}
Instead, the first casualties happened on the side of the demons.{nl}As their front line came into contact with the lake, the water began to react.{nl}
Our side did not need to fire a single arrow.{nl}The effects were varied.{nl}Some demons burned, some melted, yet others hardened into rock.{nl}
The demons had been unaware of this mechanism, as it would have been impossible for them to perform any sort of reconnaissance on the lake without a response from the tower's defenses.{nl}
Eventually, Solcomm commanded the first group to retreat.{nl}Though we took no significant action, it was a sure victory for the Schaffenstar. 
Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 3
* Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 3{nl}
Despite our ballista attacks, one demon managed to soar over the tower and return to the demons' camp alive.{nl}The injuries caused to its wings were not enough to shoot it down into the water.{nl}
Today, the demons prepared a fleet of ships for another attack.{nl}How they obtained such a large number of vessels remains unknown.{nl}It seems the demons are more resourceful than we previously thought.{nl}
We waited for the demons to approach the tower aboard their ships.{nl}Once they were near enough for us to distinguish their features, we launched our attack.{nl}There was no need for absolute accuracy, as even the slightest contact with water from the lake provoked a reaction in them.{nl}
Our projectiles bore holes into their vessels, allowing the water to seep in and cause damage.{nl}The demons were unable to drain the water out of the ships, as that would expose them to its deadly effects.{nl}
To our forces, every shot aimed in the general direction of the lake was effective. One could argue that our members were far overqualified for this task, considering our reputation as talented archers.
Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 4
* Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 4{nl}
There is a community of civilians residing at our lake.{nl}This community lives not near the tower — where the threat of war is constant — but relatively distant from it, in a small village on top of the lake.{nl}Parts of it were constructed on a magical levitation stone provided by the Schaffenstar, while others were built on ships or wooden structures.{nl}
This community is now being targeted by Solcomm.{nl}The move was not unexpected, and we at the Schaffenstar are prepared to protect the village and its residents.{nl}
It is, after all, our duty and responsibility to maintain the safety of a territory that is within our jurisdiction.{nl}On the other hand, the community is located beyond the range of the majority of projectiles that can be launched from the tower, and even our magic weapons will lose significant power when used at such long distances.{nl}
Another factor is the depth of the lake itself, which remains unknown to both our forces and the demons'.{nl}
Some fishermen are known to practice their trade at the lake. They pay a tax to Lydia Schaffen in return for protection.{nl}She may not possess the title of Lord, but effectively, Schaffen is both the owner and ruler of the territory delimited by the lake.{nl}
The people living on the lake take great pride in having Lydia Schaffen as their sovereign, as the Schaffenstar continues to govern the community fairly and mercifully.{nl}
To them, our leader represents less of a ruler and more of a guardian.{nl}Bar the Kingdom's largest cities, no place is as safe from the monsters as our lake.{nl}
In the past, attempts by monsters to breach into our territory have never posed a problem.{nl}Our usual approaches, of course, are not adequate for the large numbers of demons we are now facing.{nl}On the other hand, there is no need to engage in a full-scale war.{nl}
At the first signs of movement on Solcomm's camp, we closed off the borders.{nl}It may not have been a substantial measure, but given the location of the small island village, it was enough to deter an initial attack.{nl}Nonetheless, it would only be a matter of time before the demons could surround the village in their ships and destroy the barricades.{nl}They seemed to believe that we would not come to the aid of the villagers, and in a way they were correct.{nl}The whirlwinds that sprouted from the lake were enough to prevent them from doing any damage.{nl}
The waterspouts were powerful enough to lift the demons in the air before letting them fall down into the lake, a view that was most entertaining.{nl}
One disadvantage of this method was the difficulty of aiming the whirlwinds accurately at the enemy ships.{nl}Any vessel that encountered a waterspout, however, was immediately overturned, spilling its passengers into the lake.{nl}
Those not directly affected by the waterspouts received indirect damage from the spraying of lake water above them and from all directions.{nl}
As cruel as it may sound, it was truly a marvelous thing to see.{nl} 
Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 5
* Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 5{nl}
Rumors have surfaced saying the demons intend to recruit human mercenaries.{nl}As it is, none have been courageous enough to consider standing against the Schaffenstar and our leader.{nl}
It has been long since the demons have obstructed our movement of supplies, but there are no visible effects to the functioning of the tower.{nl}We are, I believe, better equipped to survive a siege than even the Three-Layered Castle Wall.{nl}
Even in the unfortunate event of a tyrant like King Kadumel joining forces with the demons, the tower is prepared to sustain itself for centuries without external aid.{nl}The chances of a demon such as Solcomm ever invading the tower are close to none. 
Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 6
* Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 6{nl}
After six months of inactivity, Solcomm launched a full-scale attack on the tower.{nl}His forces were supplemented by a large number of flying demons and additional troops.{nl}
The position of the lake's floating rocks is deep enough to prevent demon intruders, but too shallow to sale on a ship. Therefore, this time the demons forwent their vessels in favor of another method.{nl}They filled the bottom of the lake with boulders and rocks and used them to step over the water, slowly advancing into our territory.{nl}
They continue to fill the lake, one step at a time.{nl}If a regular siege involves digging trenches around the target, in our battle the lake itself is a trench that must be filled.{nl}We await the results of the demons' efforts.{nl}
The demons are restlessly making their way through the lake. As they are still beyond the range of our weapons, we continue to simply observe them.{nl}The only members on concrete duty are the sentinels atop the tower.{nl}
It is still early to initiate an attack on the besieging troops, as is usual in a situation like ours.{nl}
It wasn't until one day after the demons had begun advancing into the lake that we launched our first attack.{nl}By then, a few of Solcomm's subordinates were already within range of the tower's firepower.{nl}The first blow went over their heads, but the demons did not retaliate, focusing only on the task at hand.{nl}
Hoping to minimize damage, the demon forces worked inside of siege towers and other structures, but even those did not survive our constant attacks.{nl}They continued to move into the lake slowly but surely.{nl}
Eventually, the first line of their troops arrived at the entrance of the Astral Tower.{nl}Flying demons, who had been reducing damage by intercepting our catapult projectiles, were now headed for the tower itself.{nl}
The operation now felt like a true battle.{nl}From the tower we launched boiling water, projectiles, arrows, fire and different kinds of magic.{nl}Apart from those lucky enough to land on the path created by the demons, the flying monsters were hit by our arrows, falling to the lake or on top of the floating rocks.{nl}Among the members of the Schaffenstar, there were no signs of distress.{nl}Then, something felt as if it were about to happen. Lydia Schaffen was standing by the rails atop the tower.{nl}
She aimed her arrow at Solcomm, commander of the demon forces.{nl}It seemed as though she might have been waiting for him to notice her.{nl}The weapon in her hands was none other than the bow she had used to kill Ziburynas.{nl}
Solcomm acknowledged her, but she did not fire.{nl}She put away the arrow and spoke.{nl}
[You fool. The ground you are standing on is made of stone, it only floats on the water by magic.]{nl}The meaning of her words was uncertain, even to Solcomm.{nl}Soon, however, her intent was made clear by what happened next.{nl}
The entire floor began to sink lower and lower.{nl}Demons who had remained unfazed through most of the battle were now screaming in agony.{nl}Water came in through all directions, melting and burning the demons.{nl}Solcomm was unable to prevent it.{nl}
This attack had been the reason why our leader had wanted the demons to approach the tower.{nl}Even if they were to attempt escaping to land, the troops were more than an entire day away from the shore.{nl}
Few demons survived. Many members of the Schaffenstar were in shock, unable to fully grasp our victory.{nl}The defeat of the demons was tragic.

Abandoned Book
 The three rulers of Nicopolis are now more powerful than ever. Their greed knows no limits. Not satisfied with holding a grasp over Nicopolis, they are trying to influence life in the Kingdom beyond the city.{nl}
 His Majesty King Jusel is wise, and the Kingdom's young officials will not dare to taint their careers with bribes or illicit requests; I know the Court will not falter. What's more, the three of them are convinced that they themselves are the greatest wizards of our generation, above any Class Master. Surely they're going to use magic.
I believe they may try to seal off the city's borders and isolate it from the rest of the Kingdom, as a means to coerce the residents. Once the city is sealed off, the Kingdom will try and eventually tear down the barriers, but no one knows what might happen within the city until they succeed. 
Once the refuge is built, the Court can send out officials here to look after the site until the barriers are down.{nl}On the other hand, I worry that they may create a powerful magic weapon or use the city's residents to threaten the Kingdom. In that case, we can only hope the refuge will come in hand. 
Now that the Kedora Alliance has delivered the last materials, construction of the refuge is almost complete. Not only did we manage to build a place far from the gazes of the city rulers, we've also made good allies in the process. 
Should they try anything, having this shelter will allow us to denounce the rulers to the Court so they can be properly persecuted under the law. When that happens, I'm certain that better days will come to the city.{nl}- Written by Irredian, on a day of the reign of His Majesty King Jusel
Blackened Diary
To my beloved son,{nl}{nl}Thinking back, I am glad you decided to leave Nicopolis to work at the Court. I am glad I couldn't make you stay. I am writing this letter because I worry that you may try to come back after hearing what happened to the city.{nl}His Majesty cutting ties with all the incompetent Court officials and hiring young professionals like yourself is something unheard of in the last 300 years of our Kingdom's history.{nl}So don't worry about anything else, just focus on your work in the capital and serving our government.
You may hear rumors of the abuses our leaders are perpetrating, but please don't come back in vain. A great wizard by the name of Irredian is already preparing measures for an emergency, so there is no need to worry. He also built a shelter we can use if needed.{nl}I can't explain too much in detail, but the way I see it, if anything happens in Nicopolis we'll be safe as long as we're here.
Remember, Nicopolis is still under the Kingdom's jurisdiction. Neither the Pervading Queen nor the Quipmage will be able to get away with hurting our residents. If they do try that, we can always escape to the shelter. You know, your dad may not be a high-ranks wizard, but I can tell for certain that this shelter is going to survive any disaster that comes our way.{nl}So please, don't think about me being here on my own. Do your duty as a loyal vassal of His Majesty's and be the greatest administrator this Court has ever seen.{nl}- Year three hundred and... (illegible)

Dear customer.{nl}We have received your payment for the latest shipment of magic materials.{nl}The final load of cargo has arrived safely in Nicopolis and it is ready to be used.{nl}We hope you will find good use in our fine magic materials. Thank you for choosing the Kedora Merchant Alliance.
Should you require any further material support, do not hesitate to contact us.{nl}- Year 379 of the Kingdom, Kedora Alliance West Branch Manager O'Brian
Scribbled Paper
What is going on with Nicopolis?{nl}The Quipmage and the Specter, and the so-called Queen are making things worse.{nl}They keep people from moving out, so the rest of the Kingdom doesn't know what's happening.{nl}I'm only glad Irredian is standing up to them.
At least here we don't see the Quipmage, so I'm happy.
When the Pervading Queen first started to call herself that, she was only half-joking.{nl}Now, she's like a character out of a children's story.
This place was well made, sure, but I don't see it lasting forever.{nl}If things get worse in Nicopolis, I might have to consider leaving the city altogether.{nl}I just wish the king would send in a secret envoy to investigate...{nl}If he knew, he wouldn't let those three ruin the city...

A Revelator...! We can finally get back what's ours.{nl}My comrades and I promised we'd take back our town. I should go back and get ready for combat now. 
Master said we should focus on the investigation.{nl}If we go back now, we'll be in big trouble...
Is Master joining the battle?{nl}He's only been giving us orders, but he never joins our battles.{nl}I'm starting to doubt his motives. 
I'm going to send Master a carrier pigeon!{nl}Just hold on!
You're here. The giant monster already ate the tranquilizer bait and is knocked out now.{nl}I'm going to attack it and try to create a diversion.
This monster is extremely aggressive, it's going to come running as soon as it wakes up.{nl}When it comes for me, make sure to attack it from the side.
Uhh... I'm sorry, Revelator. I didn't mean to let it get away... I just froze, I didn't know what to do.{nl}But at least the poison seems to have worked. I could tell it was in pain after it attacked me.{nl}But don't worry about me, go find the monster and defeat it!
I'd be done for if it wasn't for you. Thank you.
I really thought I was going to die. Thank you, Revelator.

Banterer
I'm the one in charge around here... This ain't your area, is it...?
Huh? You forgot...?{nl}Hold on... I don't think I've seen you before...{nl}
Let me just ask you one question.{nl}What's the name of the human we support?
Let me just ask you one question.{nl}What's the name of our demon monarch?
Let me just ask you one question.{nl}What's the reason we're stationed here?
Let me just ask you one question.{nl}Who's the subordinate we manage but who isn't stationed here?
Let me just ask you one question.{nl}Who's our enemy?
Huh... My mistake.{nl}Alright, here's what's gonna happen.{nl}
When the Resistance go inside the Astral Tower, we're gonna attack them here.{nl}Got it? Then go back to your position.
The attack's gonna happen after sunset, when the moon is over the trees.{nl}Got it? Then go back to your position.
This time we're gonna go all out on them when they least expect.{nl}Got it? Then go back to your position.
Our general Banshee Boss is gonna join us in the attack this time.{nl}Got it? Then go back to your position.
If our attack works, we're gonna destroy not just the Resistance, but the entire Schaffenstar with it!{nl}Got it? Then go back to your position.
Poor guy must have gone through a lot...{nl}Sad we didn't come to hear about it until now.{nl}
I'll get ready to leave as soon as possible.{nl}I'm counting on you in the meantime.
It's too early to give up!
Not gonna lie, this feels like a trap...
Select a Crystal Piece to place on the foothold.
Take the Crystal Piece placed on the foothold?
Thought you could get rid of it that easily, did you?{nl}Tsk, tsk... And you didn't even know about me? 
Demon Lord Moringponia
What, did you think I wouldn't notice all that racket?{nl}You're pretty brave for messing with our business... I don't suppose you're counting on getting away with it...?
Found a strange Crystal Piece.{nl}Try and find more.
Found enough Crystal Pieces to place on the footholds.{nl}Return to the obelisk and place the Crystal Pieces on the footholds.
I'm glad to hear the Goddess Statue worked.{nl}But the evil energy hasn't completely disappeared yet.{nl}Where could it be spreading from...? I'll have to investigate some more.
Gotcha. Mwahahah!
Go! Go and catch them once and for all!
Ah... Evil beings are headed our way.{nl}Kartas must have found us.{nl}
What's more, in this state we won't be able to fight him.{nl}I suppose... I could hide you and Illina away from Kartas' eyes.{nl}Please, come this way...
Do not worry. Kartas will not be able to harm me.{nl}There is a reason he has been chasing after me for so long.{nl}
I believe it may have to do with these seeds...{nl}But if we can only use his temperament against him...{nl}
Oh no... We must hurry!
Mwahaha! Here you are, Medeina! Hidden in your little corner!
Still got those old powers of yours, hey?{nl}I'm surprised...! Hahah.
Kartas!{nl}I don't know what it is you want, but you won't have it your way.
Bwahaha! I'm not too worried about that, my dear.{nl}Besides...
Looks like that's no ordinary stick you got there, is it?{nl}I'll take that, thank you.{nl}
And Medeina. I'm gonna need you to come with me.
Medeina, sweetheart. You know my patience is short, why are you trying to test it?{nl}Let me ask you one more thing.{nl}
How does one revive from inside the Divine Tree?{nl}How do you do it!!{nl}
And that stick of yours. What does it have to do with all of this!?
My answer remains the same, Kartas.{nl}I will not tell those who search for the answer.
Come to think of it...{nl}It seems Giltine wasn't the one who commanded you to find me.{nl}
Oh... I see.{nl}
You and Giltine must have different goals, no doubt about that.
Heheh. I don't follow Giltine because we have the same goals, sweetie.{nl}I follow her because she's stronger than me!
And yet you wouldn't dare say that in front of her. You're afraid.
Afraid?{nl}Who said I'm afraid?{nl}
Let me tell you! I ain't afraid of no one, you hear me?
Kartas. Have you thought about what would happen if Giltine fulfilled her intentions?{nl}Will you continue to follow her if she does?{nl}
When the Creator awakens, the world as we know it will cease to exist.{nl}
What will be of you, Kartas, when that happens?
Gasp!!
Hurry and get the Teleportation Magic Circle ready!{nl}We're wasting time.{nl}
Ha... Speaking of which, where is that good-for-nothing Tantaliser?{nl}I'm surrounded by idiots! Idiots, I tell you!
It's safe to go now.
Oh... Oh no. It's too late...
Gasp! You...! You're the one who destroyed my magic circle and my Tantaliser, aren't you?!{nl}Messing with my plans again!{nl}
And you, Medeina! Trying to fool me with that stupid stick...!
Kartas! You will never get the answer you want from me!
Ilona! Yulia!
Kupole Ilona
Ugh... Master Medeina...{nl}Please, take the Revelator and go...
No! I can't!{nl}I won't leave you here...!
Kupole Yulia
Master Medeina...!{nl}Us Kupoles are only here to serve you! Your safety is far more important than ours.{nl}
We mustn't put you in any more danger.{nl}Go, run! Far away from Kartas...{nl}
Go and protect that which you must.
Kartas knows where we are. He will come find us soon.{nl}Revelator, you must leave...
Ha! Medeina!
Kartas, how many times do I have to tell you?{nl}
You will never get the answers you want from me...
Ha, I'd like to hear you say that after I throw you into the demon realm.
What are you doing, using the Revelator to provoke me!{nl}I wouldn't take another step if I were you...!
Medeina!{nl}If it was up to me, these idiots would be screaming your name from their sorry chopped heads!{nl}
Do you really want to see them suffer? Forever?
Alright, then.{nl}Have it your way...
Kartas.{nl}You will not get what you want.
Bwahahah!{nl}
Neringa, I can't believe you brought these puny humans to bother me.{nl}
Amzinas or not, no human is a match for me, you hear?! None!{nl}Hah!
You foolish, lowly creatures.{nl}You wait and see.{nl}
Next time I see you, I'm going to make you suffer! Forever!{nl}
And Neringa.{nl}Always going on about fate this, fate that with your master Laima!{nl}
Are things really going to end the way you want them to?{nl}Bwahahaha!
I made a mistake!{nl}Knowing Kartas, I was sure he was going to attack us...{nl}
We can't lose Kartas now!{nl}The Paladin Master and I are going after him!
A firefly appears and begins to point towards something.
The firefly hovers around, as if asking you to follow it.
A flower suddenly bloomed next to the firefly.
Lost butterflies will always wander towards the flowers.
A group of yellow butterflies is gathering.{nl}Which flower will you use?
A group of red butterflies is gathering.{nl}Which flower will you use?
A group of white butterflies is gathering.{nl}Which flower will you use?
What will you do with the yellow flower?
What will you do with the red flower?
What will you do with the white flower?
Beyond the hill is a place the wings of the butterflies reach only in dreams.
There is a bunch of yellow flowers.{nl}Which leaf will you use?
There is a bunch of red flowers.{nl}Which leaf will you use?
There is a bunch of white flowers.{nl}Which leaf will you use?
What will you do with the yellow leaf?
What will you do with the red leaf?
What will you do with the white leaf?
Those who guide the butterflies will be blessed by the trees in the shelter of life.
Try and do something with the crystals from Drugelis Hill.
Where the longing deer are welcome, the one blessed by the trees awaits you.
We need to go!
The two scrolls I gave you are called the Binding Scroll and the Sealing Scroll.{nl}Using the Sealing Scroll on the Magic Stone will seal up its magic power.
{nl}It's too hard to change the path of the stone's magic power while it's being supplied.{nl}So you're going to have to use the Sealing Scroll and seal that magic first.
{nl}The Binding Scroll is for securing the Tantaliser, at least for some time.{nl}If we manage to keep the Tantaliser in the path of the Magic Stone's power supply...{nl}She won't be able to escape as long as the power supply remains active.
I'll go find the Tantaliser and lure her to where the Magic Stone is.{nl}Counting on you for the rest!
Hurry!
Something feels ominous!{nl}Hurry, hide behind a tree!
That was Demon Lord Tantaliser.{nl}What's she doing here...?
In any case, I'm certain Master Medeina is hiding somewhere in the forest.{nl}The Tantaliser must be looking for her.
Ah! It's the Tantaliser!
I'm going to change the path of the Stone's magic to the front. Make sure to lure the Tantaliser that way.{nl}After you use the Binding Scroll, I'll go ahead and unleash the Magic Stone's power!
This is the Gyvenimas Shelter.
It's barely there, but I do feel a faint divine energy in the saplings and the rocks here.{nl}What about that crystal you found at Drugelis Hill?{nl}Maybe it's a clue. 
Apparition of Goddess Medeina
I knew you would be the one to find my seed, Revelator.{nl}I am Medeina, Goddess of the Forest.
I come to you as my apparition so I may avoid the evil Kartas.{nl}For reasons I ignore, he has been chasing after me incessantly since Medzio Diena.{nl}
Weakened after that tragic day, I had no choice but to run from Kartas and hide in the forest...{nl}Alas, now Kartas is getting closer to finding me every day that passes.{nl}
What's more, he created a barrier around the forest to prevent my escape.{nl}
The seed you now carry was bestowed onto me by the Holy One, who rests in eternal sleep.{nl}That very seed contains unimaginable powers.{nl}
Kartas may have no way to know of this seed...{nl}But if he comes to steal it, the consequences will be catastrophic.{nl}
Revelator, will you bring the seed to me in Parias Forest?{nl}I know this is no light request, but I believe in you.{nl}
I will be waiting.
Your crystal could be a clue...{nl}But what can we do with it?
I'm worried for Master Medeina, but Ilona will also be in danger.{nl}The forest is filled with monsters and demons...
I need to go south and find Ilona!
A firefly appears and begins to point towards something.
The firefly seems to point towards something.
You sealed off the Magic Stone's power. Good.{nl}The barrier feels weaker already.
And you have Ilona with you. I am glad.
Master!{nl}Why did you leave us... Why did you hide here all alone...
I couldn't help it, I needed to protect you from Kartas.{nl}I did not expect you to find me.
If Kartas finds you, you will be in grave danger.{nl}Take the Revelator and come see me.
The fireflies will lead you to me.{nl}
Revelator, please keep Ilona safe on your journey.
... Oh! I can feel Master Medeina's energy flowing south of the forest!{nl}Revelator! We need to go!
Ilona!{nl}Oh! And the Revelator!{nl}
I felt a strong energy coming from here, did anything happen?
Kartas took Master Medeina!{nl}I felt her energy south of the forest, we need to go!
So Master Medeina really is in the forest!{nl}I am Kupole Yulia, I serve Goddess Medeina.{nl}
Master Medeina disappeared ever so suddenly after Medzio Diena. I have been searching for her ever since.{nl}My last lead brought me here to Parias Forest...{nl}
I can't believe Kartas took Master Medeina...
I was careless, I didn't notice the demon barrier trap, and now...{nl}I'm sure the demons around here will be carrying something that can disable it...{nl}
I'm sorry, but would you check whether the Red Banterers have anything we could use for the barrier?{nl}Please.
The demons are keeping watch over Master Medeina!{nl}Revelator! Defeat the demons and rescue her!
Take the Seed of the Divine Tree and leave.{nl}I must stay, I cannot leave the Kupoles behind.
Oh no... We've been found!
Just in time.
Goddess Laima did advise Medeina following what she had foreseen.{nl}Alas, fate is never easy to escape.{nl}
Medeina fell in great danger, as she was destined to do.
I'm afraid we lost Kartas.{nl}We can only hope that Goddess Medeina is safe...
Paladin.{nl}Do not take fault for this.{nl}
Kartas will not be able to harm Medeina.{nl}Not until he finds the answers he is looking for, that is.
We're going to need the help of other Class Masters.{nl}Miss Neringa. We'll go ahead and reach out to them.
I believe I know why Kartas took Goddess Medeina.{nl}It is as Laima predicted. Whatever he is is plotting, it's related to the Divine Tree. No doubt about that.{nl}
He may have taken Goddess Medeina, but Kartas will not find what he is looking for.{nl}That Seed of the Divine Tree you carry is what he really wants.{nl}
Although... It is strange that he would be plotting such a thing, considering his personality.{nl}I don't believe he would act on his own without the instructions of his master Giltine.{nl}
And yet, I could be missing something.{nl}
Allow me to take the seed. I can keep it protected.{nl}Even if the seed's abilities are dormant, we mustn't let it fall in the hands of the demons.{nl}
Do not worry about Goddess Medeina.{nl}Kartas cannot harm her, and the future foreseen by Laima will not be changed.{nl}
These Kupoles are gravely injured, I ought to care for them first.{nl}
The future foreseen by Goddess Laima is upon us.{nl}And you are at the center of it.{nl}
But first, you must retrieve the last Revelation left to you by Goddess Laima.{nl}Do not waste any time.
Why did Master Medeia hide all by herself, without even telling us...
Even with these clues, I can't understand.{nl}But I know that, with you, we'll surely be able to find her.
So Kartas is chasing after Master Medeina...{nl}I can only hope she is safe...
Master Medeina will be around here somewhere.{nl}After we find her, you must leave the forest immediately.
Kartas' personality is unpredictable and chaotic.{nl}He's uncontrollable. He answers to no one but his master Giltine.
If only Master Medeina was fully recovered, Kartas wouldn't have gotten away with this.{nl}We were too late...
Oh, I hope she is safe...
We wasted time again because of me.{nl}You're helping us rescue Master Medeina, and it feels like I am slowing you down.
I really thought we might not survive when our ship got stranded...{nl}Fortunately the people of the Kingdom were there to save us.{nl}It is an act I will not forget.
Come on, you can take care of that in one blast.{nl}Why bother with the aim?
{nl}Don't be a chicken now.{nl}It's just a little sting.
